Four women are lying next to each other on metal tables, their legs stretched out toward the door. They are naked from the waist down.\\n\\nAnother woman in a dark blue dress is squatting on one of the tables and groaning. \"You\\'re doing great,\" says Rekha Marandi, a 25-year-old midwife who has pulled on a plastic apron over her flower-patterned blouse. A child might be born at any moment.\\n\\nA picture of the eight-armed goddess Durga hangs above the door to the delivery room, framed by a garland of flowers. The Hindu deity symbolizes female power, but this female power isn\\'t always evident here in the maternity ward. Only a simple curtain separates the delivery room from the anteroom, and it is often left open by the doctors and nurses rushing through. Rekha and her colleagues pull it closed again and again. It may just be a piece of fabric, but it is the only privacy they are able to offer the new mothers.\\n\\nRekha and her coworkers are some of the very few midwives in India. They were trained in a private clinic but do night shifts at the state hospital on the weekends. Here, they learn the practicalities of delivering a considerable number of babies. But the hope is that they might be able to change delivery-room culture for the better. Rekha says she was shocked the first time she helped out at the maternity ward of a state hospital: \"Frequently, the women are poorly treated,\" she says. They generally receive no care at all before the enter the delivery room and no one is allowed to accompany them while they are giving birth.\\n\\n\"Everything to Do with the Female Body Is Considered Unclean\"\\n\\nIn India, the second-most populous country in the world, giving birth isn\\'t just a fight for new life. It can also be a struggle for dignity and self-determination. For a country that has been striving to improve its maternal health indicators, India has greatly underestimated midwifery, lagging behind countries such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, both of which have invested in creating a professional cadre of midwives. That, though, is now changing.\\n\\nIn December 2018, the Indian government announced that it would be offering an official course of training for midwives. The training program for nurses will last 18 months and the plan calls for the establishment of a national training institute along with five regional trainings institutes across the country. \"We need to accelerate the decline in maternal and infant mortality, and we see this as an effective intervention,\" said Dinesh Baswal, deputy commissioner for maternal health at the Indian Health Ministry.\\n\\nAccording to the 2016 National Health Profile, one in 769 women died as a result of pregnancy, much higher than the maximum target foreseen for 2030 by the Sustainable Development Goals laid out by the United Nations. There are some 32,000 such deaths in India each year, almost 90 per day, with most of them dying from blood loss or infections. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it would be possible to reduce maternal mortality by more than 80 percent if pregnant women were given comprehensive care by midwives.\\n\\nBut thus far, there has been a lack of awareness in India for what exactly trained midwives do. The term \"midwife\" is used in India to refer to all women who help deliver children, in particularly the traditional \"dais,\" whose knowledge is passed down across generations but who are unable to provide emergency care if needed. Vijaya Krishnan, the founder of Sanctum, one of the few birth centers in India, believes that the main reason for the lack of political pressure to provide state-backed training to midwives is because only women are affected. \"Everything that has to do with the female body is considered unclean,\" she says.\\n\\nIn the Indian tech capital of Hyderabad, politicians, gynecologists and midwives have been fighting to improve maternal care. In the city, one can see the effect midwifery can have on maternal care at the local level.\\n\\nRekha spends much of her night shift walking back and forth between the delivery room and the labor hall. Bhobi, the woman in the dark blue dress, whimpers, \"I\\'m scared.\" It\\'s her first pregnancy. The 25-year-old wants to see her husband who is waiting outside the entrance to the hospital, but the assistant physician warns her: \"You have to stay here. If you start walking, your water will break.\" Rekha speaks with the doctor and after a couple of minutes, Bhobi is permitted to go outside. \"In the beginning, we weren\\'t allowed to do anything here,\" says Rekha\\'s coworker later. \"But now, the doctors have adopted some of our methods.\"\\n\\n\"Women Shouldn\\'t Be Treated Like Animals\"\\n\\nOutdated rules and convictions still shape the approach to giving birth in many Indian hospitals: A woman shouldn\\'t walk during labor; she shouldn\\'t drink any water; she should deliver while lying on her back; and there is no reason for men to be in the delivery room. Most of all, though, women shouldn\\'t complain so much.\\n\\nActivist Mallavarapu Prakasamma, founder of the Indian Society of Midwives, says: \"It\\'s about being humane. Women shouldn\\'t be treated like animals.\" Midwives, however, recount incidents of doctors and nurses pinching mothers during birth or hitting them on the legs with forceps.\\n\\nAnd there are numerous reports of doctors and nurses insulting the mothers during birth, saying things like: Why are you screaming now? Didn\\'t you scream in pleasure when you were having sex? Or: If you don\\'t start pushing properly, your baby will die! Rekha Marandi says that she, too, has heard such threats.\\n\\nShe and her colleagues want to change this approach. She gently strokes Bhobi\\'s back, shows her how to do knee bends and teaches her a breathing technique to minimize the pain. \"You\\'re so nice to me,\" Bhobi whispers.\\n\\n\"The women here don\\'t have an education,\" Rekha says. \"They\\'re afraid and they don\\'t know what is going on in their bodies.\"\\n\\nThe midwives received their training just a few kilometers away in the hospitals of Evita Fernandez, a 65-year-old gynecologist with short, gray hair and a golden cross hanging around her neck. Her great aunt once used to help the Nizams give birth, the Muslim rulers of the city. Later, her parents opened a clinic for women.\\n\\nAfter Evita Fernandez took over the clinic in 1996, she was soon providing care to hundreds of women a day, including an increasing number of emergencies. Some of the women died. Fernandez began reading extensively about maternal mortality. \"I understood that if we had midwives in the country who can provide comprehensive care to the women, that wouldn\\'t happen.\" In 2011, she began training some of her nurses to be midwives.\\n\\nFewer Home Births\\n\\nTo reduce maternal mortality, India had long focused on reducing the number of home births. Across the country, low-threshold health centers were established and since then, women living in poverty have received a monetary incentive to give birth under medical supervision.\\n\\nThe approach proved successful: More than three-quarters of all births now take place in hospitals and the high level of maternity mortality sank by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. And yet, the rate in India is still far higher than it is in Western industrialized countries.\\n\\nFurthermore, the trend toward hospital births had an unintended side-effect, with the rate of Cesarean sections doubling in the country within a single decade to almost 20 percent. And in some states, such as Telangana, of which Hyderabad is the capital, the rate is much higher: A survey of more than 7,000 households revealed that the rate in private hospitals was an astonishing 74.9 percent and in state hospitals, it was 41 percent.\\n\\nC-sections can save lives, but a study compiled by the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad last November argued that around 900,000 such operations performed in private facilities could have been avoided. But they are profitable: A C-section takes less than an hour and can cost between 65 euros and 500 euros, or even more. Natural births, by contrast, tend to take much longer and bring in only half as much money. The operation also has its advantages for state-run hospitals: They often face personnel shortages and the surgical approach to birth makes it easier to plan.\\n\\nIn the Fernandez clinics, every third birth is now attended by a midwife. And Fernandez says that the increased reliance on midwives has led to a 50 percent reduction in the number of epidurals and C-sections.\\n\\nThe trend back toward natural births has also been evident among more affluent couples, with a growing number of young, educated parents opting for alternatives like birth centers, which have thus far been in short supply in the country. For such couples, giving birth is no longer just a women\\'s health issue. They want to have a say in how they welcome their children into the world.\\n\\nAt 1:30 a.m., a scream rings out through the delivery room of the state-run hospital in Hyderabad. The security guard in front of the maternity ward brings Bhobi\\'s husband into the hallway and he smiles as the nurse lays his child in his arms. A son. She then takes the baby to the neonatal ward.\\n\\nA half hour later, midwife Rekha Marandi leaves the delivery room, washes her arms up to the elbow and adds disinfectant to her hands. A total of five babies were born during the last hour.\\n\\nIn a room next door, Rekha has a meal of rice and chicken together with her two colleagues. They talk about Bhobi and her birth. \"It bothered me that the doctors wanted her to give birth so quickly,\" says Rekha\\'s colleague Jismy. \"We told them they should wait with the C-section.\" After all, it was Bhobi\\'s first child and it can sometimes take several hours.\\n\\nUltimately, they were successful. The 25-year-old was able to give birth to her son naturally.', 'source': {'uri': 'spiegel.de', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SPIEGEL ONLINE'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'julia_wadhawan@spiegel.de', 'name': 'Julia Wadhawan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'fiona_weber_steinhaus@spiegel.de', 'name': 'Fiona Weber-Steinhaus', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-1402591-860_poster_16x9-uxsv-1402591.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4762453', 'sentiment': -0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 6}\n",

Rita Süssmuth, 81, was family minister for the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 1985 to 1988 in the cabinet of Chancellor Helmut Kohl (also of the CDU) before falling out of favor. Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, 75, of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), served as development minister under both Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, likewise of the SPD, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of the CDU. She ultimately occupied the post from 1998 to 2009, longer than any of her predecessors. Sixty-seven-year-old Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, a member of the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), headed up the justice portfolio in Kohl\\'s cabinet before resigning in 1996. Thirteen years later, she was back in the same position for a four-year stint under Merkel.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Ms. Süssmuth, you were the first minister for women\\'s affairs at the national level. How were you treated?\\n\\nSüssmuth: Like a woman and not like a person. Back then, when women spoke in the Bundestag (Germany\\'s federal parliament), everyone thought: \"Oh well, it\\'ll be over soon.\" There were complaints about high-pitched voices and about external appearances. I also experienced disregard of my competence. I was denigrated in discussions on issues for which I was responsible. Instead, men were allowed to speak and negotiate. It was extremely offensive.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: You quickly got a reputation for being a rebel.\\n\\nSüssmuth: There was an assumption that I would be docile. I don\\'t think that Chancellor Kohl was particularly committed to having a minister for women\\'s issues. But the CDU had realized that when it came to women\\'s issues -- things like social justice, equality, recognition of ability and responsibility -- things couldn\\'t remain as they were. I was appointed to the cabinet at a time when the Green Party already held seats in the Bundestag. The SPD was also further along than we were. Kohl should have known that I\\'m not the meek sort. In a discussion prior to the appointment, I told him: \"When it comes to the abortion paragraph 218 (which criminalized abortion), I have a different opinion.\" He said we would find a solution. In personal discussions, Helmut Kohl was extremely open. He was a liberal from the bottom of his heart. But he didn\\'t want any trouble with the party.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: And did you create trouble?\\n\\nSüssmuth: Back then, 30 years ago, you were considered an immoral woman if you even uttered the word \"condom.\" Despite all the resistance, I was still able to achieve a lot when it came to HIV prevention. But I supported a ball in Hamburg, for example, that was held in support of helping prostitutes out of prostitution. Afterward, Kohl wrote me a letter to complain. When I stood up for single mothers, it was said that I was glorifying them, as though it was better than being married. I used to get a lot of critical letters.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Ultimately, you were removed from the cabinet after just three years, promoted to a less troublesome position as president of the Bundestag.\\n\\nSüssmuth: I didn\\'t want to be parliamentary president. I wanted to be able to have a say on political issues. I actually cried when I lost my cabinet position. But then I regrouped. I had underestimated the powers that come along with the parliament office.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Ms. Wieczorek-Zeul, what were your experiences like as a young woman in politics?\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: I wasn\\'t born into feminism. But I quickly realized that I was seen differently as a woman. Everything was fine as long as I was well-behaved, but at the top, you are either the naïve fool who doesn\\'t know a thing about politics or you are vilified. I was the snake, the witch, the bitch. In parliament, I often felt a subliminal disregard for women.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: In the 1970s, you became the first national leader of the SPD\\'s youth wing, known as the Young Socialists.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: My first experience in politics: In 1966, I was at a conference of the local Young Socialists chapter and was the only one who stood out a bit from the serious-looking young men dressed in gray. When it came time to elect a secretary to take minutes, the local chapter head said: \"There\\'s a comrade sitting in the back. She can surely write.\" I just swallowed it and then replaced him as chapter head the next year. When I later ran to become head of the SPD, I found myself faced with disgust: How could a woman dare to run when men like Gerhard Schröder and Rudolf Scharping wanted the position? But I received 130,000 votes in the ballot.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: You were development minister in the cabinet led by Gerhard Schröder. He referred to women\\'s issues as \"palaver.\" What was your relationship like with him?\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: Gerhard Schröder only respected you if you took a clear position. And he was still learning, that much has to be said. Sometimes it took awhile for him to see reason.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: He has the reputation for being extremely macho. Was he?\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: He was never duplicitous. But when it comes to women\\'s rights, Willy Brandt was really the most civilized of them all. On one occasion, our party platform commission was debating whether to include the sentence: \"If you want a humane society, masculinity must be overcome.\" There was significant resistance, but Brandt pushed it through.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Ms. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, you were appointed justice minister in 1992 by Helmut Kohl, making you the first woman to hold a core cabinet portfolio. What were your experiences?\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: Even just speaking of a core portfolio is discriminatory. A core portfolio -- meaning one only for men. Of course I ended up in the position because there was a bit of a competition going on. The FDP wanted to be the first party to install a woman in that office. But not everyone was in favor. Because as head of the Justice Ministry, you have a direct influence on draft laws and can really initiate change.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Even today, the FDP has a problem when it comes to women in positions of leadership. Did you feel that you were taken seriously at the time?\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: I personally hardly ever experienced sexism. But of course I had to fight: Some in the FDP thought that because an unknown was now sitting in the Justice Ministry that they could dictate what she did.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Did you have the feeling that you as a woman had to be better than the men?\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: I think women can allow themselves fewer weaknesses. Weaknesses are immediately turned against them. But a lot has changed. Today, women are seen as a threat because they can advance to the same positions that the men want. That wasn\\'t the case 25 years ago.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: You first served in the cabinet of Chancellor Schröder and were then part of Chancellor Merkel\\'s cabinet. Has the treatment of women changed over the years?\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: She has a different style, of course. But she was never a politician who really took the lead on women\\'s issues.\\n\\nSüssmuth: When she got into politics -- back when she was called \"Kohl\\'s girl\" -- much of the political environment in reunited Germany was new to her. She didn\\'t arrive as a representative of women\\'s issues. She didn\\'t vote in favor of our compromise on paragraph 218. She wasn\\'t in favor of a quota (for female managers). It was a gradual process of convergence. But once she realized how things really work in Germany, her approach changed significantly.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Taken together, you three have 65 years of experience as members of the German parliament and 22 years in cabinet positions. You have been key members of governments led by Helmuth Kohl, Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel. How far has Germany come in terms of equality?\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: Legal equality has been largely established. That alone is a significant achievement: It used to be that women had to fight to even be allowed to work without a man\\'s permission.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: I would like to have seen someone try to forbid me from having a career.\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: Yeah, but women with less self-confidence never made it out of the home. Mothers with children out of wedlock were given a guardian for their children! Plus, it was only 20 years ago that marital rape was made illegal. That was only made possible because women from different political parties joined forces. Now, equality on paper has largely been achieved -- but we need to talk about how things look in reality. And there, things are gloomy. It starts with equal pay for equal work.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: If something is scandalous, then it is this pay gap. That has consequences. The fact that women\\'s pensions are hardly more than half of men\\'s pensions is really unacceptable.\\n\\nSüssmuth: We have had both active and passive voting rights for 100 years. That is the legal situation. But take a look at the realities of who holds power and how many women are actually involved. The situation is almost better in some developing countries.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: Rwanda has more female lawmakers than European countries do.\\n\\nSüssmuth: There is a world that isn\\'t totally provable, but which exists in reality. On the one hand, women have the feeling that we have achieved everything from a legal perspective. Really, that should be the end of it. But it becomes much more difficult when we look at society. Discrimination there is much subtler and more hidden.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: In the upper echelons of leading German companies, not much has changed in the last several decades. Is the introduction of a quota a promising strategy or is it unfair?\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: I am 75 years old. I no longer believe in fairy tales. If we hadn\\'t introduced a quota in the SPD at the end of the 1980s, there is no way that 40 percent of lawmakers from our party would be women today. And: Actively promoting women produces results. When I first took over the Development Ministry in 1998, only 7 percent of leadership positions were occupied by women. By the time I left, that number had risen to 36 percent.\\n\\nSüssmuth: I am no longer in favor of a quota. Quotas in the parties were unavoidable, otherwise we wouldn\\'t have been able to get our foot in the door. But the quota is much too weak. I am now in favor of parity.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: That is the goal. But my impression is that in times when the equality of all people is no longer fundamentally accepted, the value of gender equality also sinks. I am thinking of the nationalists and populists that are on the rise in Europe and around the world. There is a correlation: These parties don\\'t respect human rights and fall back on traditional gender roles. That is something that must be fought. Nothing is achieved forever.\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: The right-wing populists in parliaments across Europe, and here in Germany, have an antiquated view of women. We\\'re back in the 1930s. It\\'s women at the stove, supported by ideology. Just a couple of years ago, we couldn\\'t have imagined that we would seriously have to once again talk about the image of the family that, for example, the Polish government is currently supporting.\\n\\nSüssmuth: Right now, we are seeing a huge, global backlash against liberalism, humanism and feminism. It is alarming.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: And at the same time, a debate has erupted about sexism and sexual harassment.\\n\\nSüssmuth: It is appropriate for sexual harassment -- this extremely awful form of male dominance -- to be a focus. We haven\\'t overcome absolutely anything. I ask myself where we have failed. We have managed to focus on child abuse. But when it comes to effective measures to combat the abuse of women, not enough has been done.\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: I think it is good that the debate is now being conducted.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: But it can\\'t be limited to certain groups. It has to be clear that sexist discrimination is much broader in reality.\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: As serious as sexual harassment is, there is more at stake: sexist power structures. I don\\'t know if there has ever been a debate on the issue in, for example, the German parliament.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: The issue is solidarity with women globally. Every year, 300,000 women die in childbirth or shortly thereafter, mostly in developing countries. That is a gruesome number. You only have to strengthen the health care system in the right ways. In 2015, we signed on to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. That means we have obligated ourselves to ending discrimination against women in all forms and to battling AIDS around the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, girls account for 74 percent of all new HIV infections among teenagers, many of them rape victims. We can do something about that. But we haven\\'t made money available in our budget.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: The #MeToo debate has been criticized on many fronts for being overwrought and excessive. Have women gone too far?\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: The drivel about it being a witch hunt is rubbish. It\\'s just an attempt to silence the debate, it\\'s totally transparent. As if you can\\'t make compliments anymore, or flirt, or ride in the elevator with a female colleague. Nobody is demanding a law outlining what is allowed and what is not. We don\\'t need legal parameters outlining how sexual contact must proceed. People take care of that quite well on their own. But we also have to identify where structures exist that allow for the oppression and exploitation of women.\\n\\nSüssmuth: For me, the focus should also be on the men. Not just to discipline them, but to pull them out of certain roles and behavioral patterns. We need a societal and individual learning process, the discovery of a new form of masculinity.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: What should that new form of masculinity look like?\\n\\nSüssmuth: I am hopeful when I look at the younger generation. My father would never have pushed a baby buggy through town. These days, though, young men are quite happy to do so. It\\'s about new, enriching experiences with children, about empathy and care, about partnership and receptivity to a modified self-image. Today\\'s society is quite strong on those points.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Do you have the impression that #MeToo can change society?\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: Young women are very active in a world that has changed significantly, in part because of technology. They have significant capabilities and are using them. But they are taking to the streets much less often and also aren\\'t going into the institutions. What they are doing is, of course, political action. But they aren\\'t becoming involved in politics, in part because it apparently isn\\'t particularly attractive at the moment. So they express themselves in social networks; they are constantly on their smartphones. And then they have the feeling that they have actually done something. But ultimately, it often doesn\\'t have much of an effect.\\n\\nWieczorek-Zeul: Extra-parliamentary movements rooted in civil society are important. But every movement must also be implemented politically. That was also true with the 1968 movement and the women\\'s movement. Today, I see very little of that. That is why we are experiencing setbacks, such as when it comes to paragraph 219a (which prohibits advertising for abortion services) or the number of women in parliament.\\n\\nSüssmuth: We can\\'t let the world rest on its laurels. In my time, we achieved a lot primarily by working together across parties, which the party leaders didn\\'t always like. I have the feeling that that isn\\'t happening today at all anymore. Without networking and solidarity, women can be constantly played off against each other.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Do men simply cooperate better than women do?\\n\\nSüssmuth: Unfortunately, I\\'ve even seen women working against women. It was more important to them to be valued by men. Men cooperate extremely well when it comes to power, while women do so more often when it comes to specific issues. And when they cooperate there, they are exceptional. But the question of power remains an unsolved problem.\\n\\nLeutheusser-Schnarrenberger: But the desire for power must also be there. Cotton balls and intelligence aren\\'t enough.\\n\\nDER SPIEGEL: Ms. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Ms. Süssmuth, Ms. Wieczorek-Zeul, we thank you for this interview.', 'source': {'uri': 'spiegel.de', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SPIEGEL ONLINE'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'nicola_abe@spiegel.de', 'name': 'Nicola Abé', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'ann_katrin_muller@spiegel.de', 'name': 'Ann-Katrin Müller', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-1348847-860_poster_16x9-sfht-1348847.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 6}\n"

Judge Barry not only benefited financially from most of those tax schemes, The Times found; she was also in a position to influence the actions taken by her family.\\n\\nJudge Barry, now 82, has not heard cases in more than two years but was still listed as an inactive senior judge, one step short of full retirement. In a letter dated Feb. 1, a court official notified the four individuals who had filed the complaints that the investigation was \"receiving the full attention\" of a judicial conduct council. Ten days later, Judge Barry filed her retirement papers.\\n\\nThe status change rendered the investigation moot, since retired judges are not subject to the conduct rules. The people who filed the complaints were notified last week that the matter had been dropped without a finding on the merits of the allegations. The decision has not yet been made public, but copies were provided to The Times by two of the complainants. Both are involved in the legal profession.\\n\\nJudge Barry did not respond to emails or telephone messages left at her Manhattan apartment.\\n\\nJudicial council reviews can result in the censure or reprimand of federal judges, and in extremely rare cases, a referral to the House of Representatives for impeachment.\\n\\nIn retirement, Judge Barry is entitled to receive annually the salary she earned when she last met certain workload requirements. Though the exact figure was not immediately available, it appears to be between $184,500 and $217,600.\\n\\nThe Times investigation focused on how the profits and ownership of the real estate empire built by the president\\'s father, Fred C. Trump, were transferred to Donald J. Trump and his siblings, often in ways designed to dodge gift and estate taxes.\\n\\nA lawyer for the president, Charles J. Harder, said last fall, \"The New York Times\\'s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory.\"\\n\\nJudge Barry had been a co-owner of a shell company -- All County Building Supply & Maintenance -- created by the family to siphon cash from their father\\'s empire by marking up purchases already made by his employees, The Times investigation found. Judge Barry, her siblings and a cousin split the markup, free of gift and estate taxes, which at the time were levied at a much higher rate than income taxes.\\n\\nOn a financial disclosure form filed in 1999, Judge Barry noted that her share of the All County profits for the previous 17 months totaled just over $1 million.\\n\\nThe family also used the padded invoices to justify higher rent increases in rent-regulated buildings, artificially inflating the rents of thousands of tenants. Former prosecutors told The Times that if the authorities had discovered at the time how the Trumps were using All County, their actions would have warranted a criminal investigation for defrauding tenants, tax fraud and filing false documents.\\n\\nSimilarly, Judge Barry benefited from the gross undervaluation of her father\\'s properties when she and her siblings took ownership of them through a trust, sparing them from paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes, The Times found. For years, she attended regular briefings at her brother\\'s offices in Trump Tower to hear updates on the real estate portfolio and to collect her share of the profits. When the siblings sold off their father\\'s empire, between 2004 and 2006, her share of the windfall was $182.5 million, The Times found.\\n\\nJudge Barry was nominated to the Federal District Court in New Jersey by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, after several years as a federal prosecutor. She was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by President Bill Clinton in 1999.\\n\\nIn February 2017, shortly after her brother\\'s inauguration, she notified the court that she would stop hearing cases and give up her staff and chambers. She was then considered a senior inactive judge, a status that did not entitle her to salary increases, but that left her still subject to conduct inquiries. Judge Barry did not announce a reason for the change at the time.\\n\\nFollowing the court\\'s policy of confidentiality, Judge Barry\\'s name does not appear on the order ending the investigation or the correspondence with the complainants. The order identifies the judge in question as a senior inactive judge in the Third Circuit, about whom complaints were filed in October 2018. Under court rules, all complaints are reviewed by a judge, and those with an allegation of misconduct or disability are generally referred to a panel of judges for investigation.\\n\\n\"The complaints allege, on the basis of a news article, that the then-inactive senior circuit judge may have committed misconduct relating to tax and financial transactions,\" says the order, dated April 1.\\n\\nThe complaints had been transferred to the Second Circuit to avoid conflicts with judges who knew Judge Barry.\\n\\nScott Shuchart, a lawyer who filed one of the complaints, said he had done so as a concerned member of the legal profession. He said he found it \"galling\" that Judge Barry, while still receiving her federal pension, was now immune from judicial misconduct proceedings \"just because she changed from one form of retired status to another.\"\\n\\nIn an opinion article last October for The Washington Post, Mr. Shuchart wrote that he had quit his job at the Department of Homeland Security, where he had served since the Obama administration, because he believed that the Trump administration\\'s family-separation policy at the southern border was unconstitutional.\\n\\nAround that time, Mr. Shuchart joined the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning public policy and advocacy group, as a senior fellow focused on immigration issues. But, he said, he filed the complaint against Judge Barry on his own, independent of any organized effort.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'russ_buettner@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Russ Buettner', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/obituaries/archives/10trumpjudge-alt/10trumpjudge-alt-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4719718', 'sentiment': -0.1607843137254902, 'wgt': 61177}\n",

Ohioans have witnessed so many factory closures over the years that they seem to live with a permanent sense of economic wariness. The question for Democrats is how to leverage that to their advantage as they try to retake the state, which Mr. Trump won by 8 percentage points in 2016.\\n\\nDavid Betras, the Democratic chairman in Mahoning County, a traditionally blue stronghold of union voters that President Trump nearly carried in 2016, said that Democrats had not yet figured out how to use the economic angst of laid-off employees and minimum-wage workers to defeat Mr. Trump in Ohio in 2020.\\n\\n\"Believe it or not, if you listen to the president, he addresses that issue,\" Mr. Betras said. \"He does it with a lot of smoke and very many mirrors, but he\\'s at least talking about how good the economy is and what I\\'ve done for you. \\'I\\'m with you. I have your back.\\'\"\\n\\nEven as candidates focus on corporate taxation, Mr. Betras said the issue didn\\'t resonate with voters in the same way as more familiar topics like health care or immigration. \"It appeals to a small slice of the electorate,\" he said. (Mr. Betras, a lawyer, has endorsed Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio for the Democratic nomination.)\\n\\nA Gallup poll last fall suggested that taxes were generally a more important issue for Republicans than for Democrats.\\n\\nIn an election in which Democrats will seek to win back voters who supported President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, then switched to Mr. Trump, some Democrats also worry that calls to increase corporate taxes might actually turn off swing voters in this critical state, those like Thomas Chhay, a student at the University of Akron.\\n\\n\"I lean Republican,\" Mr. Chhay, 18, said last week while having lunch at the university\\'s student union. \"I agree with corporate tax cuts unless the companies ship the jobs overseas.\"\\n\\nThe list of profitable companies that pay no corporate taxes, compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, also includes Goodyear and three other Ohio companies, including the Akron-based electric utility FirstEnergy. The company, which has the naming rights to the Cleveland Browns\\' stadium, paid no taxes last year on $1.5 billion in income, according to the analysis, and will receive additional tax credits that can be used in the future. In a win for consumers, some of that will be returned to the utility\\'s customers.\\n\\nLargest Tax Rebates as a Percentage of 2018 Profit\\n\\nLargest Tax Rebates, in Millions\\n\\n0\\n\\n$200\\n\\n$400\\n\\n$600\\n\\n50%\\n\\n100%\\n\\n150%\\n\\nGannett\\n\\nIBM\\n\\nAECOM\\n\\nActivision Blizzard\\n\\nPitney Bowes\\n\\nCelanese\\n\\nJetBlue\\n\\nPrudential Financial\\n\\nDuke Energy\\n\\nWEC Energy\\n\\nDuke Energy\\n\\nPrudential Financial\\n\\nIBM\\n\\nEOG Resources\\n\\nDeere & Company\\n\\nActivision Blizzard\\n\\nWEC Energy\\n\\nDelta Air Lines\\n\\nChevron\\n\\nCelanese\\n\\nLargest Tax Rebates, in Millions\\n\\n0\\n\\n$200\\n\\n$400\\n\\n$600\\n\\nDuke Energy\\n\\nPrudential Financial\\n\\nIBM\\n\\nEOG Resources\\n\\nDeere & Company\\n\\nActivision Blizzard\\n\\nWEC Energy\\n\\nDelta Air Lines\\n\\nChevron\\n\\nCelanese\\n\\nLargest Tax Rebates as a Percentage of 2018 Profit\\n\\n150%\\n\\n50%\\n\\n100%\\n\\nGannett\\n\\nIBM\\n\\nAECOM\\n\\nActivision Blizzard\\n\\nPitney Bowes\\n\\nCelanese\\n\\nJetBlue\\n\\nPrudential Financial\\n\\nDuke Energy\\n\\nWEC Energy\\n\\nLargest Tax Rebates, in Millions\\n\\n0\\n\\n$200\\n\\n$400\\n\\n$600\\n\\nDuke Energy\\n\\nPrudential Financial\\n\\nIBM\\n\\nEOG Resources\\n\\nDeere & Company\\n\\nActivision Blizzard\\n\\nWEC Energy\\n\\nDelta Air Lines\\n\\nChevron\\n\\nCelanese\\n\\nLargest Tax Rebates as a\\n\\nPercentage of 2018 Profit\\n\\n150%\\n\\n50%\\n\\n100%\\n\\nGannett\\n\\nIBM\\n\\nAECOM\\n\\nActivision Blizzard\\n\\nPitney Bowes\\n\\nCelanese\\n\\nJetBlue\\n\\nPrudential Financial\\n\\nDuke Energy\\n\\nWEC Energy\\n\\nSource: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy\\n\\nBy The New York Times\\n\\nMs. Warren has gone the furthest in issuing a detailed plan to alter the corporate system. Under her proposal, corporations would pay a new 7 percent tax on every dollar over $100 million in profits they earn anywhere in the world. She estimated the new tax would apply to roughly 1,200 companies and bring in $1 trillion.\\n\\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign and in this one, Mr. Sanders has routinely talked about closing loopholes and capturing some of the billions in profits that multinationals have kept overseas in tax havens and out of the Internal Revenue Service\\'s reach.\\n\\nAmy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who is also running, has taken a different approach. She has tied a proposed increase in the corporate tax rate, to 25 percent from the current 21 percent, to plans to rebuild bridges, roads and airports nationwide. About $400 billion of her trillion-dollar infrastructure plan would be financed by the tax increase.\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who officially entered the race on Thursday, has not issued a formal proposal on corporate taxes. In remarks last May, however, he blamed a \"yawning\" income gap for tearing the country apart. \"We have to deal with this tax code,\" he said. \"It\\'s wildly skewed toward taking care of those at the very top. It overwhelmingly favors investors over workers.\"\\n\\n[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]\\n\\nIn surveys, more Americans support raising the corporate tax rate than lowering it or leaving it unchanged. And several Democratic candidates, like the former housing secretary Julián Castro, invoke \"fair share\" rhetoric in speeches or vow to undo the recent Republican tax law. Others, like Senator Kamala Harris of California, have focused more on the individual income tax and reducing the burden on working families.\\n\\nBut raising the headline tax rate on corporations won\\'t eliminate the corporate zero-rate club, which also results from companies taking advantage of loopholes and the way global profits are taxed.\\n\\nTwo years ago, Mr. Trump appeared at a sold-out rally in working-class Youngstown, the seat of Mahoning County, and delivered a message full of economic reassurance.\\n\\n\"I was looking at some of those big, once incredible job-producing factories,\" the president said. \"Those jobs have left Ohio. They\\'re all coming back. They\\'re all coming back. Don\\'t move. Don\\'t sell your house.\"\\n\\nBut it has not entirely worked out that way.\\n\\nGeneral Motors, one of the companies on the zero-tax list, recently idled a large plant near Youngstown that produced the Chevrolet Cruze, a decision that helped increase the company\\'s stock price even as G.M. paid no federal taxes on $4.32 billion in income.\\n\\n\"What was promised to these people was more jobs,\" said David Green, president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents workers at the plant, which is in Lordstown. \"When you give them the tax break and they take the jobs away, that\\'s like a double whammy. That\\'s a lose, lose.\"\\n\\nLordstown is in Trumbull County, where the unemployment rate was 6.6 percent in March and many of those who work are eligible for public assistance. \"Working people can get free cheese? The system is broken,\" Mr. Green said.\\n\\nNotwithstanding Mr. Trump\\'s entreaty two years ago that local workers stay put, Tyler Savin, a real estate agent, said the idling of the plant had added to his home listings and that many sellers wouldn\\'t get their asking prices as they leave Ohio for other G.M. locations.\\n\\nMr. Savin, 22, was among the customers last week at Tommy Dogg\\'s Bar and Grill in nearby Niles, the birthplace of both Mr. Ryan, the local favorite-son candidate, and William McKinley, a Republican president who was known for imposing tariffs on foreign goods.\\n\\nMr. Savin likes Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and former Representative Beto O\\'Rourke of Texas, but will ultimately vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is, he said in a whisper lest pro-Trump patrons overhear.\\n\\n\"I think corporations should pay their taxes, like Amazon,\" he said. But he said health care and support for abortion rights were more important to him.\\n\\nJeff Williams, 57, who manages a convenience store on the midnight shift, had heard about Amazon\\'s tax breaks on the radio. Last week, as he sat outside his home in Niles catching the first warm rays of the year, he also was doing some comparison.\\n\\nHe was treated for cancer, heart disease and two hernias last year but wasn\\'t able to deduct his expenses, he said. Amazon, meantime, availed itself of a full suite of tax breaks. \"Amazon doesn\\'t pay taxes, but I pay taxes,\" Mr. Williams said.\\n\\nAkron, about an hour west, is faring better economically. Mayor Daniel Horrigan won\\'t confirm or deny it, but Amazon is believed to be the company he has recruited to move into Akron\\'s Rolling Acres Mall, a once-thriving shopping center that closed in 2008, becoming a symbol of both the recession and the retail disruption caused by online shopping.\\n\\nUnder Ms. Warren\\'s plan, Amazon would have paid $698 million instead of $0 in federal taxes for 2018. In a statement, the company said it \"pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate.\" The company would not comment on whether it planned to open a facility in Akron.\\n\\nMr. Horrigan has been working to invigorate the economy of Akron, historically known as the Rubber City for its role in tire manufacturing. The tire jobs have mostly moved elsewhere.\\n\\nGoodyear, which made the list of 60 by paying no federal corporate income taxes, employs 64,000 people worldwide, but only 3,000 of them remain here, mostly in the company\\'s headquarters. A spokesman said the company\\'s 2018 tax situation stemmed from \"historical losses in U.S. operations.\"\\n\\nThe Democratic Socialists have close to 100 members in Akron, many of them supporters of Mr. Sanders. Those attending last week\\'s meeting ranged from a stay-at-home mother who said she hadn\\'t been able to pay her water bill for a year to a college professor, David Pereplyotchik.\\n\\nMr. Pereplyotchik, 37, said he believed the group should come up with a viable alternative to the corporate tax and wage system in the United States.\\n\\n\"If we\\'re fighting for something, what version of the thing are we fighting for?\" asked Mr. Pereplyotchik, who teaches philosophy. \"It seems like if you just make them pay employees more, they\\'re just not going to hire employees.\"\\n\\nMr. Robertson, the carpet cleaner, has his own idea: nationalizing the companies. \"I think forcing them to pay higher alone is inefficient,\" he said, \"and taxation alone is inefficient.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'stephanie_saul@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Stephanie Saul', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/19/us/politics/00taxes1/00taxes1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1372549019607843, 'wgt': 36768}\n",

This month, after years of falling milk prices and mounting debt, the Murrays sold their last milk cow, taking pictures while holding back tears as the final one was loaded onto a truck and taken away.\\n\\n\"It\\'s awful hard to see them go out the last time,\" said Ms. Murray, 53. \"It\\'s scary because you don\\'t know what your next paycheck is going to be.\"\\n\\nWisconsin is known as \"America\\'s Dairyland,\" but the milk makers who gave the state its moniker are vanishing, falling prey to a variety of impediments, including President Trump and his global trade war.\\n\\nOver the past two years, nearly 1,200 of the state\\'s dairy farms have stopped milking cows and so far this year, another 212 have disappeared, with many shifting production to beef or vegetables. The total number of herds in Wisconsin is now below 8,000 -- about half as many as 15 years ago. In 2018, 49 Wisconsin farms filed for bankruptcy -- the highest of any state in the country, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\\n\\nThe fate of Wisconsin\\'s farmers is a high-stakes political predicament for Mr. Trump, who narrowly won the pivotal swing state in 2016 and hopes to keep it red in 2020. On Saturday, Mr. Trump will travel to Green Bay, Wis., for a campaign rally where he is expected to trumpet his trade policies, like the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which is supposed to bolster American dairy exports to Canada.\\n\\nBut Mr. Trump\\'s trade approach has pushed many of Wisconsin\\'s already struggling dairy farmers to the edge. Milk prices have fallen nearly 40 percent over the past five years, the byproduct of economic and technological forces that have made milk easier to produce and state policies that ramped up production and sent prices tumbling.\\n\\nThat has coincided with Mr. Trump\\'s sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, which were intended to help American manufacturers but have set off retaliatory tariffs from Mexico, Canada, Europe and China on American dairy products. Most painful for Wisconsin\\'s dairy farmers has been a 25 percent tariff that Mexico placed on American cheese, which is made with a significant volume of the state\\'s milk production.\\n\\nMr. Trump has insisted that any short-term pain from his trade war will pay off in the long run through improved access to foreign markets. And he has tried to mitigate the effect by providing federal aid to farmers whose products have been hurt by the trade war. But the crumbling of Wisconsin\\'s flagship dairy industry has some farmers questioning whether Mr. Trump\\'s promises will come true in time to save their farms.\\n\\n\"Low dairy prices have made it so hard for small farms to hang on,\" said Josh Murray, 22, who is studying animal science and helping his family try to transition the farm to beef. While the Murrays received about $400 from Mr. Trump\\'s farm aid program, it was not enough to keep their milking operations afloat.\\n\\n\"In every aspect, it\\'s not worth it -- it\\'s not worth the fight,\" he said.\\n\\nFor many farmers who have been transitioning away from milk to other products, the trade wars have been the final straw. The warning signs have been flashing for a while, as milk prices declined precipitously in the last five years to below $17 per 100 pounds from almost $26. The rise of corporate farms and more efficient milking processes have led to an oversupply as consumption of milk has waned nationally.\\n\\nThe new North American trade deal, which is supposed to give dairy farmers more access to Canada\\'s tightly controlled market, has yet to be ratified by Congress and may never be approved given Democratic opposition. And Mr. Trump has yet to remove his metal tariffs on trading partners like Europe, Canada and Mexico, which refuse to lift their retaliatory tariffs until those levies come off.\\n\\nFarmer advocacy groups say policies enforced by former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, exacerbated the problem. In 2012, Mr. Walker, who was defeated in 2018 by a Democrat, put into place a program to encourage dairy farmers to step up production with the goal of producing 30 billion pounds of milk a year by 2020. That was easily accomplished by 2016, but the oversupply crippled the industry.\\n\\n\"He wanted to put Wisconsin back into the lead in milk production over California,\" said Joel Greeno, a dairy farmer and the president of the Wisconsin advocacy group Family Farm Defenders. \"It was more an example of arrogance than practicality.\"\\n\\nMr. Walker declined to comment.\\n\\nMr. Greeno said that for all of Mr. Trump\\'s protectionist tendencies, he has been a disappointment for farmers by not aiming tariffs on imported products like milk protein concentrate that would protect the American dairy industry and make imports more expensive. Many farmers favor the idea of a supply management program for dairy like the one Canada uses, but the Trump administration has not supported such a program.\\n\\nThe agricultural woes in Wisconsin are a microcosm of the difficulties that farmers across the country have faced as a result of the multifront trade disputes that have lingered for more than a year. In 2018, farm income nationally was $63.1 billion, the second-lowest total in a decade. Commerce Department figures released on Friday suggested that farmers were not anticipating much relief, as purchases of agricultural equipment were tepid.\\n\\nA report last year from the U.S. Dairy Export Council estimated that over the next several years, retaliatory tariffs by China and Mexico could cut American dairy exports by $2.7 billion and lower dairy farmers\\' revenues by $16.6 billion if they were not rolled back.\\n\\n\"He\\'s talked over time about how much he cares about these dairy farmers, but he hasn\\'t really followed up with any certainty,\" Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, said of Mr. Trump in an interview. \"Our farmers need good trade deals, not trade wars.\"\\n\\nRepresentative Mike Gallagher, a Republican from the Wisconsin district that includes Green Bay, said he had urged the White House to roll back the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump had imposed on Canada and Mexico so that farmers in his state could get relief. He said that the top concerns of dairy farmers were the tariffs, along with Mr. Trump\\'s immigration policies, which make finding farm labor more difficult.\\n\\n\"Wisconsin farmers are caught in the crossfire,\" Mr. Gallagher said.\\n\\nThe financial strain proved too much for the Voelker family in Rice Lake, a town of fewer than 10,000 people in western Wisconsin. The Voelkers sold 20 milk cows this year and the remaining 40 are expected to be gone by September, as the farm transitions to producing grain and crops. Cows that used to sell for $2,000 each a few years ago are now worth only $800. The hope is that by getting out now, they can save a family farm purchased in 1940.\\n\\n\"It\\'s stressful; it\\'s emotional,\" said Jamie Voelker, 61. \"There\\'s generations of sweat and blood and tops of fingers.\"\\n\\nThe political implications for Mr. Trump remain unclear. Wisconsin remains very much split when it comes to support for the president. In the 2000, 2004 and 2016 presidential elections, Wisconsin was decided by a margin of less than one percentage point. Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by nearly 23,000 votes, making the state a hotly contested battleground.\\n\\nThe president is aware of the importance of Wisconsin and regularly says that the new Nafta will be a boon for the state\\'s dairy farmers. In January, at the American Farm Bureau Federation\\'s convention in New Orleans, Mr. Trump even mentioned by name a Wisconsin dairy farm family that was in attendance and professed his affection for the state.\\n\\nDemocrats are hopeful that Mr. Walker\\'s defeat signals Wisconsin could become a blue state again in 2020. A poll released this week by Zogby Analytics buttressed those hopes, with Democratic candidates like Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding large leads against Mr. Trump in hypothetical matchups. On Friday, Priorities USA, the progressive super PAC, announced a six-figure digital advertising campaign in Wisconsin to make the case that voters have been left behind by the president\\'s economic policies.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Wisconsin\\'s farmers are trying to hang on. The Murrays are hopeful that raising beef cattle will be more profitable and less arduous than producing milk.\\n\\n\"You love the land, you love to watch things grow,\" Ms. Murray said. \"When it\\'s something you\\'re born doing, it\\'s hard to say you\\'re not going to do it anymore.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'alan_rappeport@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Alan Rappeport', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/25/business/00dc-wisconsin5/00dc-wisconsin5-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4748614', 'sentiment': -0.1294117647058823, 'wgt': 32158}\n",

Six of them resigned on a single day last month. The reason? They are feeling persecuted for publishing reports that shed an unflattering light on Trump policies.\\n\\nBut these reports are just reflecting reality (which has a well-known anti-Trump bias). Rural America is a key part of Donald Trump\\'s base. In fact, rural areas are the only parts of the country in which Trump has a net positive approval rating. But they\\'re also the biggest losers under his policies.\\n\\nWhat, after all, is Trumpism? In 2016 Trump pretended to be a different kind of Republican, but in practice almost all of his economic agenda has been G.O.P. standard: big tax cuts for corporations and the rich while hacking away at the social safety net. The one big break from orthodoxy has been his protectionism, his eagerness to start trade wars.\\n\\nAnd all of these policies disproportionately hurt farm country.\\n\\nThe Trump tax cut largely passes farmers by, because they aren\\'t corporations and few of them are rich. One of the studies by Agriculture Department economists that raised Trumpian ire showed that to the extent that farmers saw tax reductions, most of the benefits went to the richest 10 percent, while poor farmers actually saw a slight tax increase.\\n\\n[For an even deeper look at what\\'s on Paul Krugman\\'s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]\\n\\nAt the same time, the assault on the safety net is especially harmful to rural America, which relies heavily on safety-net programs. Of the 100 counties with the highest percentage of their population receiving food stamps, 85 are rural, and most of the rest are in small metropolitan areas. The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which Trump keeps trying to kill, had its biggest positive impact on rural areas.\\n\\nAnd these programs are crucial to rural Americans even if they don\\'t personally receive government aid. Safety-net programs bring purchasing power, which helps create rural jobs. Medicaid is also a key factor keeping rural hospitals alive; without it, access to health care would be severely curtailed for rural Americans in general.\\n\\nWhat about protectionism? The U.S. farm sector is hugely dependent on access to world markets, much more so than the economy as a whole. American soybean growers export half of what they produce; wheat farmers export 46 percent of their crop. China, in particular, has become a key market for U.S. farm products. That\\'s why Trump\\'s recent rage-tweeting over trade, which raised the prospect of an expanded trade war, sent grain markets to a 42-year low.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to realize, by the way, that the threat to farmers isn\\'t just about possible foreign retaliation to Trump\\'s tariffs. One fundamental principle in international economics is that in the long run, taxes on imports end up being taxes on exports as well, usually because they lead to a higher dollar. If the world descends into trade war, U.S. imports and exports will both shrink -- and farmers, among our most important exporters, will be the biggest losers.\\n\\nWhy, then, do rural areas support Trump? A lot of it has to do with cultural factors. In particular, rural voters are far more hostile to immigrants than urban voters -- especially in communities where there are few immigrants to be found. Lack of familiarity apparently breeds contempt.\\n\\nRural voters also feel disrespected by coastal elites, and Trump has managed to channel their anger. No doubt many rural voters, if they happened to read this column, would react with rage, not at Trump, but at me: \"So you think we\\'re stupid!\"\\n\\nBut support for Trump might nonetheless start to crack if rural voters realized how much they are being hurt by his policies. What\\'s a Trumpist to do?\\n\\nOne answer is to repeat zombie lies. A few weeks ago Trump told a cheering rally that his cuts in the estate tax have helped farmers. This claim is, however, totally false; PolitiFact rated it \"pants on fire.\" The reality is that in 2017 only about 80 farms and closely held businesses -- that\\'s right, 80 -- paid any estate tax at all. Tales of family farms broken up to pay estate tax are pure fiction.\\n\\nAnother answer is to try to suppress the truth. Hence the persecution of Agriculture Department economists who were just trying to do their jobs.\\n\\nThe thing is, the assault on truth will have consequences that go beyond politics. Agriculture\\'s Economic Research Service isn\\'t supposed to be a cheering section for whoever is in power. As its mission statement says, its role is to conduct \"high-quality, objective economic research to inform and enhance public and private decision making.\" And that\\'s not an idle boast: Along with the Federal Reserve, the research service is a prime example of how good economics can serve clear practical purposes.\\n\\nNow, however, the service\\'s ability to do its job is being rapidly degraded, because the Trump administration doesn\\'t believe in fact-based policy. Basically, it doesn\\'t believe in facts, period. Everything is political.\\n\\nAnd who will pay the price for this degradation? Rural Americans.

If another gets detained by immigration agents at a roadside checkpoint or in a supermarket parking lot, the rest may flee. And if his undocumented work force disappears overnight, there is no one to replace them.\\n\\n\"It keeps me up at night,\" said Mr. McMahon, who owns a dairy farm south of Syracuse. \"There are people out there who just say, \\'Send them all back and build a wall.\\' But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.\"\\n\\nIt has long been an open secret in upstate New York that the dairy industry has been able to survive only by relying on undocumented immigrants for its work force. Now, this region has become a national focal point in the debate over President Trump\\'s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and their role in agriculture.\\n\\nThe tensions have escalated to such a degree over the last year that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo described federal agents as reckless, accusing Immigration and Customs Enforcement of violating the rights of farmers in pursuing undocumented immigrants.\\n\\nMr. Cuomo was responding to a high-profile raid on a dairy farm, during which a farmer was briefly handcuffed after protesting that ICE agents were mistreating one of his workers. The farmer claimed ICE did not have a warrant to enter his farm.\\n\\nMr. Cuomo is a Democrat, but Republicans who represent upstate New York in Congress have also come to the defense of the farmers.\\n\\nThe pressures here reflect broader challenges facing farmers across the country who rely on undocumented workers. The farmers are struggling with a shrinking labor pool as fewer migrants cross illegally into the country and migrants who are long-term residents become too old for field work.\\n\\nThis year the labor shortage has been compounded by Mr. Trump\\'s trade war and extreme weather, forcing some small farmers to switch to higher-value crops, to reduce their acreage and to consider selling their farms.\\n\\nIf anything, the situation in upstate New York is more difficult.\\n\\nSmaller dairy farmers here have been some of the hardest hit by tougher immigration enforcement because their workers are subject to scrutiny from both ICE and the border patrol, which is allowed to operate within 100 miles of the border -- in this case, with Canada.\\n\\nAgriculture contributes an estimated $37 billion to New York\\'s economy and is responsible for nearly 200,000 jobs.\\n\\n\"We are seeing that the immigration enforcement is having a tremendous enforcement impact on farm workers, on farms,\" said Mary Jo Dudley, director of the Cornell Farmworker Program. \"For many farmers, there\\'s no alternative labor force.\"\\n\\nTo search private property like a farm, ICE needs a warrant that shows reason to believe a particular undocumented immigrant is living or working there. But if undocumented workers leave the farm to go to a grocery store, they can be approached by ICE agents in a parking lot or a roadside checkpoint, detained and deported.\\n\\nAdvocates for undocumented immigrants said ICE agents target immigrants indiscriminately in these public spaces. But ICE disputes those claims.\\n\\n\"ICE continues to focus its limited resources first and foremost on those who pose the greatest threat to public safety,\" said an ICE spokesman, Khaalid Walls. \"ICE only conducts targeted immigration enforcement. The agency does not conduct raids or sweeps that target aliens indiscriminately.\"\\n\\nSupporters of stricter immigration policies said they were sympathetic to the plight of small farms. But they pointed out that the farms\\' reliance on inexpensive, undocumented labor would handicap American agriculture in the long term.\\n\\nThey argue that while immigration crackdowns could force farms to consolidate and mechanize and may be hard for individual farmers, it would make the industry more competitive globally.\\n\\n\"The more productive policy response would be subsidized loans to invest in machinery for small-scale farmers, rather than revising how we import foreign workers and perpetuating the labor-intensive old-fashioned way of doing business,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors restricting immigration.\\n\\nDairy farmers face particular challenges because without American workers, they have no alternative to migrant labor. The government program that brings in legal temporary workers does so only for seasonal workers and dairy farming is a year-round activity.\\n\\nIn Washington, lawmakers representing dairy-heavy districts have tried to reform the legal foreign workers program to include year-round dairy workers.\\n\\nBut so far, efforts have fallen short. These lawmakers are caught between staunch conservatives who consider any reprieve a form of amnesty and Democrats who want more comprehensive immigration reform, which would also address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll have detractors on both sides,\" said Representative Chris Collins, a Republican in western New York.\\n\\nStill, Mr. Collins said, a solution is urgently required to keep dairy farms afloat while the political impasse over a comprehensive immigration package drags on. \"There\\'s not a single person representing dairy that doesn\\'t understand it\\'s a crisis, a true crisis,\" he said.\\n\\nHe plans to introduce legislation in the coming weeks that would offer temporary employment authorization to year-round farmworkers on dairies as a stopgap measure.\\n\\nDeportations have been a concern for New York\\'s farmers and farm workers since the early 2000s, when the sudden enforcement of immigration laws led to a rash of immigration enforcement activities on farms across the state. After the Obama administration narrowed the pool of immigrants ICE prioritized for deportation, some sense of security returned to upstate farming communities, which was shattered when Mr. Trump took office.\\n\\n\"We had heard things were starting to get bad, some wineries in the area and quite a few in the Finger Lakes started losing workers. It was almost immediately after Trump took office that ICE started snagging people,\" said Kelly Raby, a vineyard owner in Lewiston.\\n\\nLast fall, Victor Pacheco, the foreman on Ms. Raby\\'s family farm for 23 years, was detained by ICE agents and deported to Mexico.\\n\\nMs. Raby has struggled to find a foreman skilled enough to manage her vineyard, where the grapevines are now dusted in a light coat of snow and in need of winter pruning. This has left her uncertain about the future of their family farm and the president she helped vote into office.\\n\\n\"I still agree with Trump in a lot of ways, but I\\'m more on the fence about him now,\" Ms. Raby said. \"I don\\'t want to lose the immigrants who are working here and growing our food.\"\\n\\nOver the last 50 years, American farms have relied on two labor forces: migrants who settled in the United States during the migration wave of the 1960s and 1970s; and those who stayed temporarily, illegally crossing the border for each harvest season. But today, permanent migrants who settled are reaching their 60s, fewer and fewer seasonal migrants are coming to the United States, and enforcement operations are driving the few migrants left out of the state.\\n\\n\"Today you go to work and you don\\'t know if you\\'ll come back home and be with your family again,\" said Eladio Beltran, an immigrant from Mexico who works in an apple orchard in Albion. He is currently awaiting deportation proceedings after being pulled over by state troopers and taken into ICE custody.\\n\\n\"Being undocumented and living in New York State is not worth it anymore,\" he said.\\n\\nFor dairy farmers like Mr. McMahon, if even one of his migrant workers leaves, the absence has a drastic effect on his 2,300-acre farm operation. He depends on having enough workers for round-the-clock shifts, seven days a week. They keep this schedule year-round, he said, to ensure his roughly 800 cows are milked three times a day, their calves are fed, and all cows are medically cared for.\\n\\n\"What we really want is some kind of method of getting foreign workers legally,\" Mr. McMahon said from his farm in Homer, about 30 miles south of Syracuse.\\n\\nOwners of apple orchards and vineyards, who can afford to, have also started turning to the H-2A program, the legal foreign worker program that brings agricultural labor to the United States for temporary work.\\n\\nCritics of the program argue that workers are often exploited by employers and risk deportation if they complain about mistreatment. Farmers complain that it is costly, complicated and laden with bureaucracy.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t really have a choice but to use to H-2A,\" said Mark Nicholson of Red Jacket Orchards, which switched to using the program last year. \"When the system works, it answers one of our biggest challenges to staying in business -- and that\\'s having a reliable source of skilled farm labor. But when it doesn\\'t work, it dooms us to the same risk as before.\"\\n\\nIf the issue of undocumented farm workers is left unaddressed, there will be an impact across the supply chain. \"There will be long-term consequences that not only our farms will deal with, but consumers will have to deal with as well,\" said Steve Ammerman, the senior associate director of public policy at the New York Farm Bureau.\\n\\nWithout a legal alternative to informal migrant labor, the competition between dairy farms to retain migrant workers is so fierce that farm owners, once notorious for underpaying and mistreating workers, are now improving working conditions and wages to entice employees to stay on their farms, workers said.\\n\\nVictor Cortez is an immigrant who has worked on a dairy farm in western New York for 18 years. A few years ago, farm owners \"wouldn\\'t let us leave the farm,\" he said, adding, \"They wouldn\\'t pay us as much as they promised they would.\"\\n\\n\"But the good thing about it now,\" he said, \"is that we get paid more and this farmer is good to me.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'christina_goldbaum@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Christina Goldbaum', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/18/nyregion/00nyfarms-promo/00nyfarms-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2, 'wgt': 4096}\n",

But on Friday, Trump signaled the proposal isn\\'t dead.\\n\\n\"Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,\" Trump tweeted.\\n\\n\"The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!\" he continued.\\n\\nThe president doubled down as Democrats fumed over the relocation idea.\\n\\n\"The extent of this Administration\\'s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said in a statement Friday. \"Using human beings -- including little children -- as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal.\"\\n\\nShe added: \"The American people have resoundingly rejected this Administration\\'s toxic anti-immigrant policies, and Democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values.\"\\n\\nPelosi\\'s district -- San Francisco -- was among the sanctuary cities the administration considered sending detainees to.\\n\\nWHITE HOUSE PROPOSED RELEASING IMMIGRANT DETAINEES INTO \\'SANCTUARY CITIES\\' TO TARGET POLITICAL FOES: REPORT\\n\\nWhite House officials, though, stressed earlier Friday that the plan never went anywhere. A source familiar with discussions told Fox News that Democrats who advocate leniency toward illegal immigrants should work with the administration to find ways to transport those set for release, including in their states and districts.\\n\\nThe proposal was apparently rejected both times it came up by administration immigration agencies.\\n\\nA Nov. 16 email from the White House to officials at several agencies reportedly asked whether migrants could be arrested and bused to \"small-and mid-sized sanctuary cities\" and other Democratic strongholds. Pelosi\\'s district in San Francisco was considered one of the areas targeted, according to The Post.\\n\\nThe proposal was intended to alleviate crowded detention centers, the White House told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\\n\\nThe same report said \"the attempt at political retribution raised alarm within ICE.\" An ICE official responded, noting that there were budgetary and liability issues, but also said \"there are PR risks as well.\"\\n\\nThe source familiar with the discussions argued, however, that the White House did not view this as political retribution.\\n\\n\"This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,\" the White House told The Post.\\n\\nIn a statement, Deputy ICE Director Matt Albence also pushed back and said he was not pressured by the White House - though indicated such a proposal was put forward.\\n\\n\"As the Acting Deputy I was not pressured by anyone at the White House on this issue. I was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded. The email exchange is clear and suggesting that it indicates inappropriate pressure is inaccurate,\" he said.\\n\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether immigration agencies would now support the proposal.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly blasted sanctuary cities, which are areas where local authorities refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agencies. The cities are typically run by Democrats.\\n\\nThe president was also hit this week with questions over the administration\\'s past family separation policy at the border. Trump said they have no plans to revive the policy, amid renewed speculation about whether the practice could return amid a shake-up in staffing at the Department of Homeland Security including the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\\n\\nKevin McAleenan, who was serving as CBP commissioner, is replacing her as acting secretary.\\n\\nNielsen\\'s resignation comes amid an influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Nielsen was reportedly frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the border. But administration officials told Fox News that McAleenan best fits Trump\\'s requirement of being the \"toughest cop\" on the frontier, and that Nielsen had been viewed as resistant to some of the immigration measures pushed by the president and his aides.\\n\\nBy Tuesday, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady also resigned.\\n\\nAnd on Wednesday, Nielsen announced that ICE Acting Director Ron Vitiello would be stepping down by the end of the week.', 'source': {'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'brooke_singman@foxnews.com', 'name': 'Brooke Singman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/11/1024/512/694940094001_6025096047001_6025099158001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'eventUri': 'eng-4722222', 'sentiment': -0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 3168}\n",

The other Democratic candidates should too.\\n\\nBill Clinton had a consequential presidency when it came to the economy. He brought down the Reagan-era deficits, helping spark the strongest economic boom in decades, and he made the tax code more progressive.\\n\\nBarack Obama had an even more consequential presidency. He halted the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. He did so in part by signing a stimulus bill full of spending on education, wind energy and other programs with lasting benefits. He also put in place new regulations for Wall Street and extended health insurance to almost 20 million people.\\n\\nYet for all that both men accomplished, neither changed the fundamental direction of the American economy.\\n\\nBy the end of Obama\\'s eight years, G.D.P. growth was still disappointing. Middle-class and poor families were still receiving less than their fair share of that growth. Median household wealth was lower than it had been two decades earlier. In the most shocking sign of struggle, average life expectancy has declined in recent years. Rich Americans, on the other hand, continue to thrive, amassing Gilded Age-level concentrations of wealth. The resulting frustration helped make possible the rise of Donald Trump.\\n\\nThis history suggests that the Democratic Party\\'s economic agenda needs to become more ambitious. Modest changes in the top marginal tax rate or in middle-class tax credits aren\\'t enough. The country needs an economic policy that measures up to the scale of our challenges.\\n\\nSo far, only one candidate among the 2020 contenders has an agenda with this level of ambition: Elizabeth Warren. Her platform aims to reform American capitalism so that it once again works well for most American families. The recent tradition in Democratic politics has been different. It has been largely to accept that big companies are going to get bigger and do everything they can to hold down workers\\' pay. The government will then try to improve things through income taxes and benefit programs.\\n\\nWarren is trying to treat not just the symptoms but the underlying disease. She has proposed a universal child-care and pre-K program that echoes the universal high school movement of the early 20th century. She favors not only a tougher approach to future mergers, as many Democrats do, but also a breakup of Facebook and other tech companies that have come to resemble monopolies. She wants to require corporations to include worker representatives on their boards -- to end the era of \"shareholder-value maximization,\" in which companies care almost exclusively about the interests of their shareholders, often at the expense of their workers, their communities and their country.\\n\\n[Sign up for David Leonhardt\\'s daily newsletter with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web.]\\n\\nWarren was also the first high-profile politician to call for an annual wealth tax, on fortunes greater than $50 million. This tax is the logical extension of research by the economist Thomas Piketty and others, which has shown how extreme wealth perpetuates itself. Historically, such concentration has often led to the decline of powerful societies. Warren, unlike some Democrats, comfortably explains that she is not socialist. She is a capitalist and, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, is trying to save American capitalism from its own excesses.\\n\\n\"Sometimes, bigger ideas are more possible to accomplish,\" Warren told me during a recent conversation about the economy at her Washington apartment. \"Because you can inspire people.\"\\n\\nBefore I go further, I want to offer two caveats. One, Warren\\'s grasp of the country\\'s problems does not necessarily mean that she should be the Democratic nominee for president. Politics is not an expertise competition. The nominee should be, and most likely will be, the candidate who best inspires voters. Maybe that will be Warren, or maybe it will be someone else.\\n\\nTwo, I don\\'t agree with all of Warren\\'s proposals. Her plan to break up the big technology companies seems too uniform, for example. Her plan to put workers on corporate boards may not be as practical as, say, as big federal push to increase workers\\' bargaining power.\\n\\nBut whatever my -- or your -- specific objections, Warren is identifying the right problems and offering a coherent vision for a post-Obama Democratic agenda. \"Clinton and Obama focused on boosting growth and redistribution,\" Gabriel Zucman, a University of California, Berkey, economist who has advised Warren, says. \"Warren is focusing on how pretax income can be made more equal.\"\\n\\nShe isn\\'t simply proposing larger versions of Obama\\'s (worthy) tax cut for middle-class and poor families, as several 2020 candidates have. Her plans are also much more detailed than those of Bernie Sanders (who, to his credit, pushed the party to become bolder). And she has avoided getting trapped in the health insurance wonkery that too often dominates progressive policy debates. The future of the republic does not actually depend on the relative sizes of Medicare, Medicaid and the private market.\\n\\nIt may, however, depend on whether Americans\\' incomes and living standards are consistently rising.\\n\\nIn the months to come, I hope that every other 2020 candidate offers answers to the questions that Warren has taken on: How can corporate America again help create a prosperous, growing middle class, as it did from the 1940s through the 1970s? How can the power of giant corporations -- over consumers, workers and smaller businesses -- be constrained? How can the radical levels of wealth inequality be reversed? How can the yawning opportunity gaps for children of different backgrounds be reduced? How can the next president make changes that will endure, rather than be undone by a future president, as both Obama\\'s and Clinton\\'s top-end tax increases were?\\n\\nIt is not surprising that Warren has jumped out to an early lead in the ideas primary. The main theme in her life, both professional and personal, has been economic opportunity. Her father was a carpet salesman at Montgomery Ward in Oklahoma City in the 1960s, until he had a heart attack. He had to switch to lower-paying work as a janitor, and her mother got a minimum-wage job, answering phones at Sears.\\n\\nWarren\\'s three older brothers all went into the military. \"That was their chance to make it into the middle class,\" she told me. Warren went to college and became a teacher, until the school chose not to renew her contract rather than give her maternity leave. She then went to a public law school -- for $450 per semester -- and became a bankruptcy expert, early on at the University of Houston and ultimately at Harvard.\\n\\n\"The way I see it is, I have lived opportunity,\" she said. \"I\\'ve lived the kind of opportunity that comes from a government that invests a little in its kids, a government that tries to keep the playing field a little bit level for folks like my family.\"\\n\\nHer theory of political change has been shaped by two experiences -- one failure and one success. As a professor in the 1990s, she served on a federal bankruptcy commission and fought against legal changes that favored banks over borrowers. The fight went on for a decade, and Warren\\'s side lost. The defeat left her believing that a technocratic legislative debate -- \"the inside game,\" as she calls it -- almost always favors industry lobbyists.\\n\\nThe success came during the Obama administration, when she pushed for an agency to protect consumers against banks\\' misbehavior. The idea was new. It was also simple enough for voters to understand. She hawked it on \"The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.\" This time, Warren\\'s side won. Trump has since constrained the agency, but it still exists and is still doing good.\\n\\nThose experiences help explain why Warren thinks that bigger changes are sometimes more feasible than modest ones. Bigger changes -- tangible, new ideas -- can overcome voter cynicism. \"A lot of people don\\'t believe you can actually make any change on economics,\" Warren says. I would add another, even larger, example to the pattern: Obamacare. Trump has undone many of Obama\\'s more modest changes, on taxes, climate and other areas. But Obama\\'s grandest accomplishment endures. For all its flaws, it proved too popular to kill.\\n\\nWarren\\'s agenda is a series of such bold ideas. She isn\\'t pushing for a byzantine system of tax credits for child care. She wants a universal program of pre-K and child care, administered locally, with higher pay for teachers and affordable tuition for families.\\n\\nAnd to anyone who asks, \"But how will you pay for that?\" Warren has an answer. Her wealth tax would raise more than $250 billion a year, about four times the estimated cost of universal child care. She is, in her populist way, the fiscal conservative in the campaign.\\n\\nThe wealth-tax proposal has shifted the national debate more than any other 2020 proposal so far. It has made people realize the most middle-class families pay an annual tax on their largest asset -- called the property tax. But the wealthy do not, because financial holdings aren\\'t taxed the way real estate is. Some center-left economists have criticized a wealth tax as too disruptive, potentially threatening some family-owned businesses, but many others have praised it. \"This type of wealth tax,\" Gene Sperling, the former top economic adviser to Obama and both Clintons, has said, \"is essential.\"\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest reason to be hopeful about Warren\\'s larger agenda -- separate from her fate as a candidate -- is that it\\'s popular. Americans are deeply divided on social issues like abortion, religion and, to some extent, immigration and guns. But a clear majority favors a wealth tax. A clear majority favors universal child care. A clear majority favors aggressive government action to check corporate power and create decent-paying jobs. On economic issues, as Warren says, \"The progressive agenda is America\\'s agenda.\"\\n\\nTo other 2020 candidates, I\\'d say: Be ambitious. Tell the country how you would end the new Gilded Age and improve people\\'s lives. Presidential campaigns are the time for big ideas.\\n\\nMore from Opinion on Elizabeth Warren:Opinion: One-on-One With Elizabeth WarrenMarch 13, 2019Opinion | Paul Krugman: Democrats for Family ValuesFeb. 21, 2019Opinion | Steven K.

The 16,000-word investigation should quiet anyone who thinks that the survival of that often-infuriating newspaper is of no particular consequence to the future of American democracy. It should also lay to rest any remaining arguments that the Murdochs are engaged in anything but a power-seeking charade: pretending to be in the news profession while subverting it at every turn.\\n\\nThe piece, titled \"Planet Fox,\" by Jonathan Mahler and Jim Rutenberg, has not received the attention it deserves, in part because it does not contain any blockbuster scoops that could easily fit into a CNN or MSNBC chyron or pithy tweet. What it does contain is a history of how one family has been able to use the power of the press to subvert democratic norms, misinform citizens, undermine governments, and fill our national debates with lies, misogyny, racism, and ethnocentrism while calling it news.\\n\\nMurdoch watchers have long argued over whether Rupert Murdoch is motivated more by money or power. The answer, almost always, is \"yes.\" That\\'s the man\\'s genius: In his case, the two travel in tandem. But should they conflict, it is the money that matters. Take the most interesting fact I found related to Fox News\\'s horrific treatment of the late Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. You may recall Sean Hannity\\'s and FoxNews.com\\'s obsessive promotion of a bizarre conspiracy theory that, with the Trump White House\\'s encouragement, sought to tie Rich\\'s 2016 killing to allegedly nefarious doings of the committee, though it was always hard to understand exactly how. Rich\\'s family sued, and the site quietly withdrew the story. It was a rare example of Murdoch caving in to any form of moral public pressure, or so we thought. (The family\\'s lawsuit was eventually dismissed.)\\n\\nIt turns out it was all business. The Murdochs were in a desperate and ultimately unsuccessful fight to try to win over British regulators for their proposed takeover of the Sky satellite network. Their first attempt to do so collapsed under the weight of the phone-hacking scandal at News of the World, which ultimately forced Murdoch to shut down the 168-year-old tabloid and endure a humiliating parliamentary hearing (along with a pie in the face). Now they were trying again.\\n\\nFinding himself in this position was unusual for Murdoch. In the United States, especially with Trump in office, he gets what he wants. That\\'s why Fox\\'s sale of its non-news assets to Disney last month went so smoothly, despite the red flags it raised vis-à-vis Disney\\'s potential monopoly power. It is also the likely reason that the Sinclair Broadcast Group, a Murdoch competitor, found itself stymied in its attempt to buy up most of Tribune Media\\'s television outlets. But in the UK, Fox News faced accusations of promoting \"unfair and inaccurate content,\" and in another investigation, British regulators ruled that Fox\\'s Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson breached impartiality standards. To help smooth these bumps, Murdoch was willing to pull the channel off the air in the UK -- though, even then, his bid for Sky Broadcasting failed.\\n\\nAustralia, meanwhile, has become a veritable Murdoch playpen. Viewers of Fox News\\' prime-time lineup in the United States would no doubt recognize the constant warnings populating the Murdochs\\' Sky News Australia channel about the alleged \"suicidal self-hatred\" of the West and the dangers of Muslim immigrants; no less familiar would be the ranting of guests with views just this side of Adolf Eichmann\\'s. What they may not know is that, working with politicians, the Murdochs managed to facilitate the replacement of the relatively moderate government of Malcolm Turnbull with the more rabid one of Scott Morrison. The Murdochs never made their intentions explicit. Rather, as the Times authors observe, they tend to \"convey their desires indirectly, maybe with a tweet...or a question, the subtleties of which are rarely lost on their like-minded news executives.\"\\n\\nIn the United States, Trump\\'s rise complicated the story a bit. Murdoch initially resisted supporting a man he regularly termed a \"fucking idiot,\" whose policies on immigration he disliked, and whose vulgarity he disdained. But here, again, money talked. Nothing goosed Fox News\\' ratings like Trump\\'s Nuremberg-style rallies, and with Megyn Kelly and other Fox News personalities criticizing him, Breitbart was winning over the network\\'s once-loyal audience. Of course, Trump\\'s success was Fox News\\' Frankenstein monster: a product of the channel\\'s 20-year war on truth.\\n\\nWith the accused sexual predator Roger Ailes ousted (and dead), Trump has become Fox News\\' de facto chief programmer. Until recently, Ailes\\'s aide-de-camp and, according to many, enabler of his sexual misconduct, Bill Shine, was double-dipping, with generous severance payments from Fox in addition to his White House communications chief\\'s salary. Demonstrating that those roles were actually one job, Shine appears to have arranged for special access for Hannity at Trump press events, as well as an appearance onstage with Trump during a 2018 rally. He also could be found issuing instructions to Fox News producers: for instance, demanding the removal of a chyron deemed unfavorable to Ivanka Trump.\\n\\nStill, amid all the revelations -- the power plays, the venal deals, the palace intrigue -- the greatest shame of this story goes to people who receive no mention at all. It belongs to the journalists who, against all evidence and to the detriment of their profession and their nations\\' democracies, continue to participate in the charade that what the Murdochs do is journalism and that, therefore, their dishonesty, provocation, and propaganda deserve to be taken seriously as news.

In 1990 and 1991 he had losses of over $250 million a year -- \"more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years.\"\\n\\nWell, you can\\'t deny he was a record-breaker.\\n\\nTrump likes to portray his old financial troubles as a temporary product of a recession. But even back then it was pretty apparent that he wasn\\'t really, truly all that great at deal-making. At the time, I called him a \"financially embattled thousandaire\" and he took great offense.\\n\\nTry that yourselves, people. See how often you can refer to our president as \"our world-famous thousandaire.\" He seems to have more money now, but it\\'ll still drive him crazy.\\n\\nTrump would like us to believe all that red ink was actually a canny business strategy. \"You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes,\" he tweeted after the Times report, adding that \"it was sport.\"\\n\\nOn behalf of the millions of Americans who filed their I.R.S. returns last month, I want to say that it is always a treat to hear our president explain how only suckers pay taxes.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s becoming increasingly clear that even the cynical version of Donald Trump as a businessman -- undisciplined self-promoter who bought and sold things just to convince himself he wasn\\'t a useless nothingburger living off his rich dad\\'s money -- was maybe an overestimation.\\n\\nWhich can be sort of unnerving, given his current job. For instance, just before we got this new batch of information on his failure as an empire-builder, Trump met with Democratic leaders of Congress to discuss -- a big, huge building plan.\\n\\nInfrastructure! In theory, this is the one thing in Washington everybody likes. When Trump was campaigning, he promised a big, exciting $1 trillion agenda for what he would later describe as \"gleaming new roads, bridges, railways and waterways.\"\\n\\nActually what we need most is road repair. Filling potholes is all well and good, but it doesn\\'t come under the category of \"gleaming.\"\\n\\nAfter he was elected, Trump never went so far as to say \"all that stuff I talked about is actually boring.\" But when Infrastructure Week rolled round and he was dispatched to Ohio for a speech about waterways, he veered off into an attack on the Democrats for being \"obstructionists\" on health care. Meanwhile, the James Comey crisis was unreeling in Washington. The whole thing was sort of a disaster.\\n\\nIn 2018, the president promised \"the biggest and boldest infrastructure investment in American history,\" to be paid for by, um, persons other than himself. Mostly state and local governments, and tolls on drivers and truck transport. Nothing happened.\\n\\nWhen the nation\\'s builders were once again celebrating Infrastructure Week, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked if the administration planned to submit a bill.\\n\\n\"Ever?\" she responded.\\n\\nAnd thus it went until last week, when Trump sat down with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to discuss a possible plan. Infrastructure was back! And to everybody else\\'s surprise, the president upped the ante to $2 trillion. Twice what he talked about when he was campaigning and making up promises all over the place.\\n\\nWe\\'ve yet to find out which Donald Trump was negotiating with the Democratic leaders. Once in a while a Good Donald spirit takes over the president and he suddenly announces he\\'s going for real immigration law reform, or serious gun control legislation or. ... Doesn\\'t really matter. Experience suggests the Good Donald doesn\\'t last more than a couple of days. The one who wanted to help those DACA Dreamers wound up shutting down the government over a border wall.\\n\\nStill, a big-ticket infrastructure program doesn\\'t require a profile in courage or even a plan. It\\'s the political equivalent of a litter of puppies, only larger and more expensive.\\n\\nExcept you\\'d need a real government to carry it out, with smart, disciplined oversight. Otherwise the money would get wasted on pork-barrel projects and endless consulting contracts that turned into extremely expensive plans to nowhere.\\n\\nSort of like one big Trump Shuttle.\\n\\nLately, there\\'s been no talk on the presidential side about how to pay for it -- that\\'s coming, ha-ha, later. The Democrats have suggested raising the gas tax or cutting back on those tax cuts for the wealthy. Mitch McConnell has made it clear he won\\'t let anybody mess with those tax cuts, which will cost the government about $2.3 trillion in revenues over the next decade. Add that to the new $2 trillion in infrastructure spending, you\\'d have -- a bunch of money, right?\\n\\nTrump seems unworried. \"Nobody knows debt better than me,\" he said during the campaign.

Immigration Courts Overwhelmed by Indigenous Languages\", 'body': 'SAN DIEGO -- With Magdalena Lucas Antonio de Pascual and her three children facing deportation, the immigration judge wanted to make sure she understood the charges against her. But even with the help of an interpreter speaking in Q\\'anjob\\'al, a Mayan language, Ms. Antonio de Pascual appeared to comprehend little.\\n\\n\"What language do you speak?\" Judge Philip S. Law asked.\\n\\n\"The reason why I left my country?\" she replied through the translator.\\n\\n\"I came across the border illegally because I needed to,\" she later told the judge.\\n\\n\"I am going to ignore what you just told me, because that\\'s not what I asked you,\" he said. \"I am trying to explain the process and your rights.\"\\n\\nThroughout the 50-minute hearing, the misunderstandings kept coming.\\n\\nMs. Antonio de Pascual is one of many migrants coming into the United States from remote areas of Central America who only speak indigenous languages. An increase in the number of these migrants is adding to delays in a court system that is already overwhelmed by a backlog of more than 800,000 cases. Now the courts do not have enough translators to serve them, pushing the system to its limits, many lawyers, interpreters and advocates say.\\n\\nUnited States immigration officials provide translators in as many as 350 languages over all, including Mandarin, Creole, Punjabi, Arabic and Russian. But Mam, K\\'iche\\' and Q\\'anjob\\'al -- all indigenous to Guatemala -- have each become one of the 25 most common languages spoken in immigration court in the past few years.\\n\\nIn San Diego, a Q\\'anjob\\'al speaker had her asylum hearing pushed back for more than a year because no translators were available. In another case, a man whose primary language is Mam was unable to explain that his family had been killed in his Guatemalan town, which could be a basis for asylum, his lawyer said. The problems have seeped into the criminal courts as well: In the case of one man accused of a misdemeanor battery, the court interpreter, who was speaking in Ixil, did not ask him if he was competent to stand trial, as the judge instructed, but instead told him to \"pray to God,\" according to a complaint filed in Wisconsin state court.\\n\\nAshley Tabaddor, an immigration judge in Los Angeles and the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said the lack of interpreters was contributing to even more delays.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a colossal waste of our time to now have to reorganize hundreds of thousands of cases to deal with language issues and then there\\'s no interpreter,\" Ms. Tabaddor said.\\n\\nThe small number of interpreters who do have a basic grasp of indigenous languages are still often ill-equipped to help -- they must explain legal terms that are difficult to comprehend in any language and there are significant differences between regional dialects.\\n\\nWith migrants who cannot understand or be understood, lawyers and immigration experts say, there is no way to ensure fairness in court.\\n\\n\"We have an entire infrastructure set up where the default language is Spanish, but there are thousands of people coming to the southern border who can\\'t communicate that way -- and they basically become invisible,\" said Blake Gentry, a researcher who estimates that as many as a third of the migrants crossing the border through Arizona do not speak Spanish.\\n\\nImmigration courts across the country have seen a steady rise in speakers of indigenous Guatemalan languages in the last five years, according to the Justice Department\\'s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the court. And they are only the most recent additions to the list, which for several years has routinely included Zapotec, Mixtec, Ixil and Popti, languages from southern Mexico and Central America.\\n\\n\"The lack of interpretation for indigenous people has been a problem for a long time,\" said Odilia Romero, a Zapotec interpreter who has been an activist with the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations for the last 20 years. \"But what we see now is something entirely different: We have entire populations showing up with languages that we have not seen in the United States before.\\n\\n\"The court may provide an interpreter so they have fulfilled the requirement, but that doesn\\'t mean there is any real understanding,\" she said.\\n\\nAlthough many immigration courts have Spanish interpreters on staff, they rely on private contractors for interpreters of indigenous languages. Nearly all in-person interpreters come from one Virginia-based company, SOS International, which has an $80 million contract with the federal government.\\n\\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Immigration Review said the court tries to accommodate all non-English speakers and constantly monitors the cases nationally to meet new needs.\\n\\nBut getting interpreters to court is hardly a given: With so few of them in such high demand, they have to be arranged weeks or even months in advance. Judges are often forced to rely on interpreters by phone, making it difficult to hear and impossible to understand body language. And interpreter shortages are plaguing courts across the country, including New York and Chicago.\\n\\nEven when interpreters are in court, it is routinely difficult to explain legal concepts to the migrants, particularly to the vast majority who do not have a lawyer. And because many indigenous interpreters do not speak English, they must use \"relay\" interpretation -- with the judge\\'s English first being translated into Spanish before being translated to the indigenous language.\\n\\nIn many cases, said Ms. Tabaddor, the immigration judge, migrants who speak only rudimentary Spanish try to get by in that language, sometimes out of shame or a belief that Spanish will help them convince United States officials that they should be allowed to stay.\\n\\nThe problem extends to lawyers, who often can\\'t speak to their clients. Carmen Chavez, the executive director of the Casa Cornelia Law Center, a nonprofit immigration legal service in San Diego that helps match clients with translators, said that of the more than 2,000 cases the group handled last year, roughly a quarter of migrants from Latin America did not speak Spanish.\\n\\n\"It is constantly difficult to find someone who is qualified to interpret for these cases,\" she said.\\n\\nEven among interpreters certified to work in the courts, there is little oversight, and advocates worry whether interpreters and those who hire them are competent.\\n\\nSince immigrating to Los Angeles from Guatemala in the 1990s, Policarpo Chaj has worked as a K\\'iche\\' interpreter for lawyers, doctors and other businesses. Mr. Chaj said he has repeatedly heard of lawyers trying to hire anyone they meet who speaks K\\'iche\\' and Spanish.\\n\\n\"Speaking a language is not the only thing that makes you qualified to be an interpreter,\" he said. \"You have to understand the law, you have know how to write, you have to know how to ask something concrete. You are dealing with people\\'s rights, it is your moral responsibility to make sure they understand exactly what the judge is saying.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s possible for migrants to not encounter a single person who speaks their language on their path through the immigration system, making it all but impossible to give officials information. While most agents working along the Mexican border and in detention centers speak at least basic Spanish, few know any indigenous languages. Officers often grow frustrated and accuse these migrants of being uncooperative, leaving them even more confused, lawyers and advocates say.\\n\\nChildren who do not speak Spanish are especially isolated, shelter workers say. They are left without the ability to speak with counselors and are more likely to act out, then are punished or medicated. Parents who only speak an indigenous language often cannot communicate that they have been separated from their children.\\n\\nEven migrants with lawyers are often forced to depend on their bilingual children for further help.\\n\\nIn court, Ms. Antonio de Pascual struggled to explain her situation through the court interpreter. The family arrived last summer, meeting her husband who has lived in the San Diego area for several years. She enrolled each of her children in school, and her 8-year-old daughter refused to miss class for the court hearing. Ms. Antonio de Pascual, who is illiterate, said she could not remember what forms she signed or questions she answered when she spoke to United States officials near the border last year.\\n\\nMs. Antonio de Pascual\\'s initial hearing had already been postponed because no translator was available. As this recent one ended, she asked the judge to give her six months to save money for a lawyer. Saying that would be too much time, the judge said he wanted her back in court in June and expected her to begin looking for a lawyer immediately.\\n\\nWhen she was dismissed, her 12-year-old son, who speaks limited Spanish and Q\\'anjob\\'al, took the stack of court documents, placing them inside his small green backpack. He said he planned to spend the afternoon calling the phone numbers listed for pro bono lawyers who might take their case.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jennifer_medina@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Jennifer Medina', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/11/us/00translators-01/00translators-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 2519}\n",

But by attempting to prove their virtue, they accomplished just the opposite.\\n\\nTheir tax returns revealed that each of the Democratic candidates gave an embarrassingly low percentage of their sizable income to charity in recent years. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren won the title as most charitable, giving a whopping 5.5 percent of her household\\'s $906,000 income to charity in 2017. In second place is Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who, along with his wife, gave 4 percent of their income in 2017. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and her husband contributed 2 percent of their $215,000. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar contributed 1.9 percent out of $338,500, while California Sen. Kamala Harris contributed just 1.4 percent out of $1.9 million.\\n\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders just became a millionaire in 2016, raking in $1,073,333. Yet he gave only $10,600 to charity -- less than 1 percent of his income. He upped his generosity in 2017 and 2018, donating an \"impressive\" 3 percent.\\n\\nBETO O\\'ROURKE CONFRONTED AT TOWN HALL ABOUT STINGY CHARITABLE DONATIONS\\n\\nFinally, Beto O\\'Rourke and his wife gave 0.3 percent of their $366,455 to charity in 2017. Good news: that\\'s up from 0.2 percent in 2016. Don\\'t worry, though, O\\'Rourke\\'s campaign team has announced they are busy looking for the \"thousands of dollars\" of charitable giving that weren\\'t, for some reason, reflected on his tax returns. The American people anxiously await their excavation.\\n\\nThe lack of magnanimity among Democrats isn\\'t exactly surprising. A 2018 study found that, on average, Republican-leaning counties give more to charity than Democratic-leaning counties. This echoes similar findings from a 2012 study. In general, Republicans and conservatives tend to be more generous than Democrats and progressives. This is probably because Republicans are more likely to be religious than Democrats are, and religion is a major motivating factor in charitable giving.\\n\\nAnd yet, that\\'s certainly not the reputation the right has in the media. Conservatives -- especially those who voted for Donald Trump -- are consistently accused of racism, elitism and bigotry for their positions on welfare and immigration. Progressives, on the other hand, are empathetic, inclusive and kind, eager to care for the least of these.\\n\\nBut if progressives are so concerned with the plight of the poor and the exploitation of the marginalized, why aren\\'t they more willing to give to the many organizations who help these groups overcome their challenges?\\n\\nI doubt the answer is more complicated than this: they just don\\'t want to. If a wealthy person wants to give to charity, there\\'s nothing stopping them. I understand it takes a lot to cover the expenses of three homes, but you\\'d think once Sanders hit millionaire status he\\'d be willing to fork over a little bit more than 3 percent of his earnings. This is the same socialist senator who often decries the greed of the 1 percent. He must be speaking from experience.\\n\\nThe fact is, there\\'s nothing more hypocritical than a socialist who\\'s selfish.\\n\\nBut he\\'s not necessarily speaking for the experience of others who share his pay grade. According to 2014 IRS tax data, Americans who made more than $1 million that year contributed an average of 5.6 percent to charity -- well above Sanders\\'s percentage.\\n\\nDemocrats understand they don\\'t have to be charitable themselves to be hailed as heroes for the oppressed. No one expects them to give their own money to the needy; they\\'re deemed compassionate just by telling other people to give theirs. They know very well that the media will cover for their selfishness. They will still be able to effectively sell themselves as vigilantes for the downtrodden by spinning emotional arguments about a mandatory living wage and \"Medicare for all\" despite the crushing costs of these policies to the rest of the country.\\n\\nPlenty of Americans make far less than the Democratic presidential candidates, but they give more to charitable causes. And yet these are the Democrats are demanding pay even more to cover their socialist programs. That doesn\\'t sound like compassion to me. It sounds like manipulation and greed -- the two characteristics, ironically, these Democratic candidates ascribe to \"the wealthy.\" A different and worse kind of wealthy, of course, than them.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTo be fair, President Trump has yet to release his tax returns, so we can\\'t safely say he\\'s been any more generous with his money than the Democratic candidates have been.

Under that timetable, the bill could be set up for passage after the upcoming recess, which ends April 29.\\n\\nIt is just one of three similarly themed bills currently circulating in Albany, including the New York Truth Act, which would permit the state tax department to release five years of state income tax returns from eight federal and state officials, including the president, if they earn income in New York.\\n\\nOriginally introduced in 2017, the New York Truth Act foundered in the Assembly after concerns were raised about the mass release of politicians\\' tax information. Since then, however, the Assembly sponsor, David Buchwald, a Westchester County Democrat, said he has solidified the support of more than 90 Assembly members -- more than enough to pass a bill in that chamber. Mr. Hoylman, the Senate sponsor, has said he also has commitments from a majority of Senate members to pass the bill.\\n\\nCarl E. Heastie, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, said that \"there seems to be nationwide desire\" to see Mr. Trump\\'s taxes, and that his chamber would discuss the bill after the spring recess. He also said that any proposal to seek state tax returns -- which would likely contain much of the same information as the president\\'s contested federal returns -- would need to be vetted by lawyers.\\n\\nMr. Trump, who is from New York and whose business is still headquartered here, has steadfastly refused to release his federal tax returns. And while Republicans suggested that the attempts by the Democrat-led Legislature were partisan, both Mr. Hoylman and Mr. Buchwald defended their bills, saying that voters had a right to know about Mr. Trump\\'s personal and business finances.\\n\\n\"Making sure that the public has information about the man currently in the White House is something that I feel is incumbent upon us to make sure is released,\" Mr. Buchwald said, adding, \"There\\'s a copy of President Trump\\'s New York State tax returns right here in New York State, in an office somewhere.\"\\n\\nBoth lawmakers said that the urgency of their bills had increased since last week, after a request from the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, to release six years of Mr. Trump\\'s federal returns by April 10. The I.R.S. and the Treasury Department in Washington are still deciding whether to comply with that request, but on Sunday, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that Democrats would \"never\" see the president\\'s tax returns.\\n\\nAndrew Sidamon-Eristoff, a former commissioner of taxation and finance under Gov. George E. Pataki, said that Mr. Hoylman\\'s bill would \"generate furious and lengthy litigation\" if passed, because of federal laws protecting tax information.\\n\\n\"The I.R.S. and others will likely argue that most New York return information is based on protected federal return information,\" Mr. Sidamon-Eristoff said. \"Disaggregating the information will be a major practical challenge, if not impossible.\"\\n\\nIn January, Mr. Cuomo had proposed a plan to have all candidates for statewide and legislative office release several years worth of returns, but the measure did not advance. Mr. Cuomo allows reporters to see his taxes every April, but does not allow copies to be made.\\n\\nThe bill introduced on Monday by Mr. Hoylman would amend current state laws that generally prohibit such private tax information from being released, and would cover a broad range of filings, including personal income taxes, corporation taxes and real estate transfer taxes. Under it, the chairman of any of three congressional committees -- the Senate Finance Committee; the House Ways and Means Committee; and the Joint Committee on Taxation -- could request tax returns from the New York tax department, which would be authorized to release the information.\\n\\nMr. Hoylman is also the sponsor of a third bill that would require candidates for president and vice president to reveal their past tax returns in order to appear on primary and general election ballots, a strategy tried by lawmakers in more than a dozen other states.\\n\\nOn Monday, Mr. Hoylman said that he would be happy with the passage of any of the three pending bills.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care how we get it done, frankly,\" Mr. Hoylman said. \"I want the route that is most politically feasible, which I\\'m certain is the one the Legislature will follow.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jesse_mckinley@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Jesse McKinley', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/08/nyregion/08nytrump1/08nytrump1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4716059', 'sentiment': -0.04313725490196074, 'wgt': 2374}\n",

Commentators are publishing opinion pieces about how Democrats can win back rural voters. Think tanks are issuing manifestoes about reviving heartland economies.\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing wrong with discussing these issues. Rural lives matter -- we\\'re all Americans, and deserve to share in the nation\\'s wealth. Rural votes matter even more; like it or not, our political system gives hugely disproportionate weight to less populous states, which are also generally states with relatively rural populations.\\n\\nBut it\\'s also important to get real. There are powerful forces behind the relative and in some cases absolute economic decline of rural America -- and the truth is that nobody knows how to reverse those forces.\\n\\nPut it this way: Many of the problems facing America have easy technical solutions; all we lack is the political will. Every other advanced country provides universal health care. Affordable child care is within easy reach. Rebuilding our fraying infrastructure would be expensive, but we can afford it -- and it might well pay for itself.\\n\\n[For an even deeper look at what\\'s on Paul Krugman\\'s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]\\n\\nBut reviving declining regions is really hard. Many countries have tried, but it\\'s difficult to find any convincing success stories.\\n\\nSouthern Italy remains backward after generations of effort. Despite vast sums spent on reconstruction, the former East Germany is still depressed three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\\n\\nMaybe we could do better, but history is not on our side.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the matter with rural America? Major urban centers have always been magnets for economic growth. They offer large markets, ready availability of specialized suppliers, large pools of workers with specialized skills, and the invisible exchange of information that comes from face-to-face contact. As the Victorian economist Alfred Marshall put it, \"The mysteries of the trade become no mysteries; but are as it were in the air.\"\\n\\nBut the gravitational pull of big cities used to be counteracted by the need to locate farming where the good land was. In 1950 U.S. agriculture directly employed more than six million people; these farmers supported a network of small towns providing local services, and some of these small towns served as seeds around which various specialized industries grew.\\n\\nNor was farming the only activity giving people a reason to live far from major metropolitan areas. There were, for example, almost half a million coal miners.\\n\\nEven then, rural areas and small towns weren\\'t the \"real America,\" somehow morally superior to the rest of us. But they were a major part of the demographic, social and cultural landscape.\\n\\nSince then, however, while America\\'s population has doubled, the number of farmers has fallen by two-thirds. There are only around 50,000 coal miners. The incentives for business to locate far from the metropolitan action have greatly diminished. And the people still living in rural areas increasingly feel left behind.\\n\\nSome of the consequences have been tragic. Not that long ago we used to think of social collapse as an inner-city problem. Nowadays phenomena like the prevalence of jobless men in their prime working years, or worse yet, the surge in \"deaths of despair\" by drugs, alcohol or suicide are concentrated in declining rural areas.\\n\\nAnd politically, rural America is increasingly a world apart. For example, overall U.S. public opinion is increasingly positive toward immigrants. But rural Americans -- many of whom rarely encounter immigrants in their daily lives -- have a vastly more negative view.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, rural America is also pretty much the only place where Donald Trump remains popular; despite the damage his trade wars have done to the farm economy, his net approval is vastly higher in rural areas than it is in the rest of the country.\\n\\nSo what can be done to help rural America? We can and should make sure that all Americans have good health care, access to good education, and so on wherever they live. We can try to promote economic development in lagging regions with public investment, employment subsidies and, possibly, job guarantees.\\n\\nBut as I said, experience abroad isn\\'t encouraging. West Germany invested $1.7 trillion in an attempt to revive the former East Germany -- more than $100,000 per capita -- yet the region is still lagging, with many young people leaving.\\n\\nNor, realistically, can we expect aid to produce a political turnaround. Despite all that aid, in 2017 more than a quarter of East German men cast their ballots for the extreme-right, white nationalist Alternative for Germany.\\n\\nI\\'m sure that some rural readers will be angered by everything I\\'ve just said, seeing it as typical big-city condescension. But that\\'s neither my intention nor the point. I\\'m simply trying to get real. We can\\'t help rural America without understanding that the role it used to play in our nation is being undermined by powerful economic forces that nobody knows how to stop.\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

For months, economists have warned that closing the border could gravely affect American access to fresh produce imported into the country. That shortage would most likely be felt by avocado lovers, as the U.S. imports about 80 percent of its total avocado supply from Mexico.\\n\\nThat means goodbye creamy morsels of heart-healthy fats. Adios gorgeous guacamole. See you later wonderfully trendy -- if not slightly overrated -- avocado toast. Well, it\\'s goodbye at least for a little while.\\n\\nSteve Barnard, chief executive and president of Mission Produce, the largest grower and distributer of avocados in the world, said Americans could run out of avocados in as little as three weeks following a shutdown at the border, Reuters reported.\\n\\n\"We would be out of business for a while,\" Barnard said.\\n\\nIn March 2018, Barnard told The New York Times that his company was \"scrambling\" to keep up with America\\'s booming desire for the creamy green fruit. Since the early 2000s, the company has grown between 10 to 15 percent each year to meet the rising demand.\\n\\nBut if Trump is able to execute a shutdown, Mission Produce wouldn\\'t be scrambling; they\\'d simply be unable to supply the U.S. at all.\\n\\nBut is the situation really that dire?\\n\\nThough Mexico is the largest U.S. supplier of avocados, about 10 percent of all imported avocados come from other countries, including Peru, Chile and the Dominican Republic. A border shutdown would not impact those imports.\\n\\nIn California, which is the largest producer of domestic avocados, the harvesting season does not last throughout the entire year (in Mexico\\'s temperate climate, avocados are grown and harvested year round). Domestic avocados likely won\\'t be available until late spring or early summer -- and if they\\'re in high demand, they\\'ll be a lot more expensive.\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they\\'re not relevant right now and won\\'t be for another month or so,\" Barnard told Reuters.\\n\\nAccording to the California Avocado Commission, less than 1 percent of the state\\'s soil is actually fertile for avocados, which take 14 to 18 months to grow. That means an unexpected surge in domestic demand couldn\\'t be met for more than a year after seeds get planted.\\n\\nOf course, it\\'s not just avocados that Americans should be worried about. Currently the U.S. imports about half of its vegetables and 40 percent of its fruit from Mexico. A closed border would likely mean higher prices on many grocery staples like tomatoes, cucumbers and many berries.\\n\\nFor the avocado obsessed, it might be safer to just start stocking up now.

Wages and benefits are rising as businesses scramble to find workers in construction, health care and other industries. Government-induced minimum-wage standards and benefits often force employers to cut their payrolls to make a profit. But that's not what's happening now. Businesses are growing because of the Trump administration is cutting regulations, and taxes and the labor pool on the low end.\\n\\nTurns out supply and demand does work.\\n\\nManufacturing employment declined a bit, Friday's report noted.

All of which should be bad news for the country\\'s lenders -- and good news for investors betting against them.\\n\\n\"Should\" being the operative word.\\n\\nEven with danger signs piling up, the shares of the six biggest Canadian banks have stubbornly refused to drop, instead surging 9.4 percent this year -- and frustrating short sellers hoping to make money on stock-price declines.\\n\\n\"This is a process, not an event -- that\\'s how I think about it,\" said Bradley Safalow, whose firm PAA Research LLC advises investors to short companies including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of Canada, and who has short positions in those banks himself. \"There is some patience that\\'s absolutely required.\"\\n\\nThe bet against Canadian stocks has become known as the \"Great White Short\" and investors pushing it remain confident that the decline will finally come -- it\\'s just a matter of time. There\\'s simply too strong an argument against the banks, they contend.\\n\\nCanada\\'s six big banks had a 13 percent jump in the value of short-interest positions from the start of the year to the end of March, according to financial-analytics firm S3 Partners LLC. Those lenders had an average 3.4 percent of their outstanding shares in short-interest positions as of March 31, up 25 percent from a year earlier, S3 data show. CIBC\\'s stock has the greatest proportion of short-interest positions, at 6.4 percent, while Royal Bank is the lowest, with 1.5 percent of its shares shorted to the end of March.\\n\\nYet both banks\\' shares are on the rise, with CIBC\\'s stock up 7.4 percent this year and Royal Bank gaining 11 percent.\\n\\nIn comparison, short-interest positions at the major U.S. banks range from about 0.6 percent of outstanding shares for Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase Co. and Citigroup Inc. to 2 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to S3.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t lose sleep over this question, personally,\" Bank of Montreal Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said in an interview when asked about short sellers after the lender\\'s annual investors meeting on April 2. About 2.7 percent of his bank\\'s outstanding shares are shorted. \"I think the market is a lot healthier than some people think it is.\"\\n\\nToronto-Dominion Bank CEO Bharat Masrani said some investors have been trying unsuccessfully to short Canadian banks for the past decade. \"I suspect the bet has not turned out too well if one has been trying it for 10 years,\" he said in an interview after his bank\\'s annual meeting.\\n\\nIndeed, the argument for being long on banks is a strong one. Canadian unemployment is at its lowest in at least four decades and economic growth is accelerating. And, despite some signs of deterioration, consumer default rates remain low. Banks have bolstered their case by diversifying beyond domestic consumer lending, delving deeper into wealth management, commercial loans and private banking while expanding operations in the U.S. and other foreign countries.\\n\\nThat\\'s not enough to scare off skeptics like Seth Daniels, of Boston-based JKD Capital LLC, who\\'s been betting against Canadian housing since 2014. They see a bubble about to burst.\\n\\nHome sales have fallen in recent years across Toronto and Vancouver, the result of new taxes and government regulations -- including tougher mortgage-qualification rules -- to curb rising debt and speculative purchases. To ease affordability concerns, the federal government announced plans in March to take equity positions in homes purchased by first-time buyers.\\n\\nDaniels said that years of lax lending standards, incentive-based loan approvals and monetary policy favorable to buyers drove prices up too quickly and by too much, \"which will lead to a spike in defaults and a significant economic correction.\"\\n\\nThe \"Great White Short\" isn\\'t new. The idea has been around since the financial crisis a decade ago, when investors predicted that the U.S. housing collapse would spread north. Instead, stimulative measures to blunt a global recession prompted record-low interest rates. That in turn fueled a borrowing binge and surging home prices in Canada, which has morphed into the current bursting-bubble bet.\\n\\n\"The trade is very cyclical -- it comes in waves,\" said Barclays Plc banking analyst John Aiken. \"Every six to eight months it suddenly hits this resurgence, and in the past has been beaten down and dies off.\"\\n\\nFor short sellers to be successful, \"you\\'ve got to have some sort of shock\" to the housing market, Aiken said -- something unlikely to happen as long as the supply of homes remains tight in Vancouver and Toronto, which limits the amount prices can fall. With Canada recording its biggest influx of immigrants in more than a century last year, including 106,000 to Toronto alone, that shock may not come for some time.\\n\\nSteve Eisman, who foresaw the collapse of subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has shorted Canada a couple times over the years, with his most recent call reaching back almost two years. He hopes to profit from a milder swoon.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never said that I thought there was going to be a housing collapse in Canada,\" the Neuberger Berman Group money manager said in an April 5 phone interview. His argument relates to the country\\'s credit conditions. \"You\\'re going to get some normalization of credit where you\\'re going to have normal levels of losses.\"\\n\\nThat will translate into more bad loans for the banks, causing them to miss earnings, and force them to increase their capital levels to cover additional potential losses, according to Eisman, who\\'s shorting companies including Royal Bank and CIBC.\\n\\nThe reason short sellers have been unsuccessful can be partly attributed to one man: Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bailed out failing alternative lender Home Capital Group Inc. in 2017, said Jared Dillian, editor of The Daily Dirtnap market newsletter.\\n\\n\"That whole deal was framed as a seal of approval by Warren Buffett on the country of Canada,\" Dillian said. \"The effect on sentiment in Canada was massive, and that prolonged the trade easily for another two years. That single-handedly saved the country.\"\\n\\nDillian started shorting Canadian stocks about six years ago and still holds short positions in Canadian banks he wouldn\\'t name. Dividends present a pesky problem for short sellers. The average dividend yield for Canada\\'s six biggest banks is 4.4 percent, giving shorts a high carrying cost.\\n\\n\"You need the stock to go down 30 percent from here just to break even, which is kind of the position I\\'m in,\" he said.\\n\\nAmong other obstacles for short sellers: Practices that set the stage for the U.S. housing bust, including particularly risky loans, are nonstarters in Canada. And, unlike in the U.S., mortgages are \"full recourse\" in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they\\'ve walked away from their properties.\\n\\nShort seller Marc Cohodes, whose Canadian bets have included Home Capital, said Canadian banks make for bad shorts because of the government and regulatory support they enjoy.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never been short the Big 5 banks because it\\'s essentially like shorting the government,\" Cohodes said in an interview. \"They\\'re like national entities.

There\\'s one thing, though, they agree on: shuttering stores on Sundays.\\n\\nIn April, Parliament began debating a law aimed at \"returning the weekend to families.\" Five Star has advocated shutting stores some 45 days a year. The League is proposing a milder version, easing restrictions in the runup to Christmas and other holiday periods. But they both say the laws would reinforce long-standing traditions such as Sunday lunch at home while giving retail workers a needed break and letting would-be shoppers go to Mass. \"Town centers are deserted as families spend their day of rest at the mall,\" says Andrea Dara, a League lawmaker working to find a compromise.\\n\\nThe two parties rode to power by tapping into constituencies with little in common: pro-business northerners and young, often unemployed southerners. One thing the two groups share? They\\'d both be hurt by restrictions on Sunday shopping, according to Istituto Cattaneo, an economic research group in Bologna. The Five Star proposal would shrink gross domestic product by 0.5 percent -- €9.4 billion ($10.6 billion) -- and cost almost 150,000 jobs, the institute said in an April report. That would reduce tax revenue by as much as €2 billion, undercutting government efforts to reboot an economy that\\'s predicted to see virtually no growth this year, with unemployment stuck at almost 11 percent. \"It\\'s obvious that the plan under discussion isn\\'t the right way to save commerce,\" says Carlo Rienzi, chairman of Codacons, a consumer-rights group. \"I hope these proposals will be abandoned.\"\\n\\nOther than in Germany, which requires the bulk of stores to shut their doors on Sunday, most Europeans can shop every day of the week. But blue laws have considerable resonance among the Continent\\'s new right wing, and two other countries ruled by populists have sought to reinstitute bans. Hungary tried it in 2015 but backed down a year later after consumers balked and an opposition party called for a referendum on the issue. Poland a year ago ordered that stores be shuttered two Sundays a month. Next year the ban is scheduled to be extended to almost every Sunday, but it\\'s under review after grousing by businesses. Tesco Plc and Biedronka, the country\\'s biggest retailer, have said they\\'ve been hurt by the rule. \"Keeping shops closed on Sunday is like squeezing toothpaste back into the tube,\" says Davide Rossi, an attorney in Milan and a director of Aires, a trade group of retailers. The idea \"goes against free trade, kills competition, and contradicts constitutional values.\"\\n\\nItaly long followed the Christian custom of largely shutting down on the Sabbath, but in 2011 the government loosened the rules with a law dubbed Salva Italia (Save Italy) aimed at bolstering retailers in the wake of the financial crisis. Proponents at the time said opening stores on Sunday makes it easier for working people to get their shopping done. But some left-leaning labor groups and far-right conservatives called it a burden on workers and families. \"Parents can\\'t spend even a single day with their kids anymore because they work in a shop all week,\" Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said last September when introducing the idea of a ban.\\n\\nIn Rome a parliamentary commission is holding hearings on the issue. The proposal getting the most traction would require stores to close on 26 Sundays a year, plus holidays. But many questions remain: Will the ban apply even to smaller stores? Sunday shopping is likely to be allowed in historic city centers, but should those privileges be extended to malls on the periphery? Will beach destinations be exempted in the summer? Ski resorts in winter? Working out the details is likely to take months, which is fine with opponents -- and even the many Italians who remain undecided on the issue. \"As an employee, I\\'d be totally in favor of closures,\" says Sharon Farina, a clerk in a Rome perfume shop. \"But as a consumer, I\\'m happy to see stores open.\" -- With Maciej Martewicz', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'maciej_martewicz@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Maciej Martewicz', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'chiara_albanese@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Chiara Albanese', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'jerrold_colten@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Jerrold Colten', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'salva_italia@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Salva Italia', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/idoAYY8yZDfQ/v0/1200x630.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1058823529411765, 'wgt': 1815}\n",

Just Call It a Job Machine', 'body': 'SAN FRANCISCO -- David Dancer is a 48-year-old marketing executive who has worked for big brands like Charles Schwab and Teleflora. A year ago, he got a call from a recruiter for a different kind of company: MedMen, a cannabis retailer that has been called \"the Apple Store of weed.\" The opening was for a chief marketing officer. He took it.\\n\\nOne of Mr. Dancer\\'s early projects was a slick two-minute video by the director Spike Jonze that begins with an anecdote about George Washington as a hemp grower, a staple of dorm-room conversation. It concludes with a suburban couple coming home with a bright red bag of legally purchased pot, symbolizing \"the new normal\" -- an ending that, like his own career twist, seemed improbable not long ago.\\n\\n\"It can and should be a part of anyone\\'s everyday life,\" Mr. Dancer said in a recent interview, sounding very much like a man who has been hired to do marketing.\\n\\nAlthough cannabis remains illegal on the federal level, 33 states now allow its sale at least for medical purposes. Ten of them, including California, have legalized recreational use. And as new markets open and capital continues to flood in, the cannabis industry has become, by some measures, one of the country\\'s fastest-growing job sectors.\\n\\nThe jobs range from hourly work at farms and stores to executive positions. They also span the country. Columbia Care, a medical cannabis company that is based in New York and has 500 employees, has indoor farms and manufacturing plants in Massachusetts, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Arizona and the District of Columbia.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to know exactly how many jobs there are in the legal cannabis business. The United States Labor Department collects data from cannabis farms and retailers, but does not provide figures for the industry. Still, listings for cannabis-related positions have rocketed to the top echelon of the fastest-growing-job categories on sites like Indeed and ZipRecruiter.\\n\\nJulia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter, said the company\\'s data put the number of cannabis jobs nationwide at 200,000 to 300,000. Most of those jobs are on the lower end of the pay scale, consisting of rote agricultural work like plant trimming ($10 to $15 an hour) and \"budtenders\" (about $25,000 a year), who help customers decide what kind of cannabis they want and then weigh and bag it.\\n\\nBut as the industry expands, there has also been a strong demand for better-paid positions like chemists, software engineers, and nurses who consult with patients about using cannabis for anxiety and other medical conditions.\\n\\n\"The early signs are that this will grow rapidly,\" Ms. Pollak said.\\n\\nA few years ago, navigating the marijuana industry felt like a journey to the fringes of legitimacy. Cannabis-prescribing doctors set up shop in strip malls and record stores, or consulted with patients over brief video chats. Dispensaries were often in barred storefronts, and their employees had to engage in the charade of scolding their prescription-bearing customers if they talked about sharing purchases with friends.\\n\\nNow cannabis dispensaries occupy brightly lit spaces on prime retail strips that have showcase buds in glass cases and tinctures in small squeezer bottles, along with $80 pot lotions and $20 bars of pot soap. Six months ago, Canada became the first major world economy to legalize recreational marijuana use, and several dozen cannabis stocks -- many for companies that are American in all but name but unable to list in the United States -- now trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange.\\n\\nVivien Azer, a managing director at Cowen in New York, became the first major Wall Street analyst to follow the cannabis industry in 2016. She has since been joined by competitors at Jefferies and Piper Jaffray, and cannabis companies now attend investor events alongside big consumer products companies like Kellogg, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble. Ms. Azer projects that the legal United States cannabis market will grow to $80 billion by 2030, a forecast that assumes federal legalization.\\n\\nMs. Azer tracked alcohol and tobacco companies, and cannabis seemed a natural extension. \"I\\'m just talking about them as stocks like any other stock that I cover,\" she said.\\n\\nFor investors, it\\'s a two-pronged thesis. The first is that many people like recreational use. The second is that as cannabis becomes more widely used, in particular the strains rich in cannabidiol, or CBD, it is increasingly a therapeutic remedy that people substitute for pain pills, sleep aids and other pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nThe pioneers who brought the industry out of the shadows are being joined by professional managers and executives -- \"talent,\" in corporate speak -- who have had careers in other industries. For upper-level managers and executives, companies say they prefer candidates with a background in highly regulated industries like alcohol or pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nSteve DeAngelo\\'s website calls him the \"Father of the Cannabis Industry\" and has a picture of him, smiling, in what pot enthusiasts know as his trademark look of a blue fedora atop graying Willie Nelson braids that rest on the shoulders of his jacket. And there he was in the same get-up on a recent Friday afternoon, standing by a pair of A.T.M.s watching the long line of customers waiting to buy cannabis at Harborside, a cannabis dispensary and farming company that he and a partner founded in 2006 in Oakland, Calif.\\n\\nMr. DeAngelo was there to introduce Menna Tesfatsion, his company\\'s new chief operating officer. Whereas Mr. DeAngelo\\'s background includes a history of radical politics, interviews in High Times and an arrest for marijuana possession, Mr. Tesfatsion is a lawyer who worked in real estate and property development before getting into the cannabis industry.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a generational opportunity,\" said Mr. Tesfatsion, who was wearing a vest, as Bay Area executives do. \"We\\'re just beginning to scale.\"\\n\\nMr. DeAngelo said the ability to attract professional managers would go a long way toward determining how well cannabis companies did from here.\\n\\n\"We\\'re the world\\'s best experts in cannabis,\" he said of the early entrepreneurs. \"But we didn\\'t have much opportunity to learn mainstream business skill sets like finance and compliance and marketing and real estate.\"\\n\\nEager to shake the image of being high-end drug dealers, cannabis companies have become hypersensitive to anything that sounds unprofessional -- hence the insistence on calling the substance cannabis instead of pot, weed or marijuana. Buds are \"flower.\" Hash is \"extract.\" Stoners are \"high per-capita consumption consumers.\"\\n\\nBryan Passman, a longtime executive search consultant in Miami, recently started a cannabis-centric recruiting firm. It was originally called The Grass Is Greener Global (The GIGG), but he changed it to Hunter & Esquire because clients told him that they\\'d prefer he had a more professional-sounding name.\\n\\nMr. Passman advises interviewees that if they want to let a prospective cannabis employer know that they partake in the company\\'s product, they should avoid saying, \"I like to smoke pot,\" and instead try something like \"I have a relationship with the plant.\"\\n\\nThe idea, he said, is to be \"purposefully subtle.\"\\n\\nJobs in the industry come with a few caveats. Because cannabis is still illegal from the federal perspective, noncitizens should probably stay away for now, lest they risk their immigration status, Mr. Passman advises. If you\\'re collecting a federal pension, you should consult a financial adviser to see if it\\'s at risk. Also: Be realistic about the stigma you might face from employers in other industries.\\n\\nAfter a decade in pharmaceutical marketing at companies including Gilead Sciences, Julie Raque recently became the vice president for marketing at Cannabistry Labs, a cannabis research and testing company in Chicago.

She elbowed her way into the city\\'s bustling social scene and tried to raise money to open a members-only arts club on Park Avenue South.\\n\\nTo friends and those wanting to do business with her there was no reason to believe she was not whom she said she was -- a wealthy German heiress with a taste for the high life.\\n\\nFor years, she had played the part, and looked it, too. She wore the latest designer clothes -- Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent -- and moved from one boutique hotel to the next. She doled out $100 tips, treated friends to expensive meals and chartered a private plane to Omaha for the Berkshire Hathaway Conference.\\n\\nBut prosecutors in Manhattan said it was all a lie. Ms. Sorokin, they said, swindled $275,000 from the rich and the unsuspecting -- including friends and financial institutions -- to pay for the luxurious lifestyle she so desperately desired.\\n\\nOn Thursday, a jury voted to convict Ms. Sorokin, 28, on charges of second-degree grand larceny, theft of services, and one count of attempted grand larceny. But jurors found her not guilty of one of the most serious charges against her -- attempted grand larceny in the first-degree regarding a $22 million loan she tried to obtain. She faces up to 15 years in prison on the second-degree grand larceny charge.\\n\\nThe case against Ms. Sorokin, as presented during a monthlong trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is an unusual New York City tale about a young grifter who went to extraordinary lengths to convince people that she was an heiress named Anna Delvey.\\n\\n\"\\'Fake it until you make it,\\'\" her lawyer Todd Spodek said during opening statements last month. \"Anna had to live by it.\"\\n\\nUnethical? Yes, Mr. Spodek said. Unorthodox? Sure. A crime? No, he argued, because Ms. Sorokin intended to pay everyone back. In a world fascinated with \"glamour and glitz,\" she had only allowed people to believe what they wanted about her, he said.\\n\\nBut Kaegan Mays-Williams, a prosecutor, told jurors Ms. Sorokin \"put herself in the best position to take money\" from wealthy people so she could \"live the fantasy of an extravagant lifestyle beyond her means.\"\\n\\n\"She stole from banks,\" Ms. Mays-Williams said. \"She stole from hotels. She stole from friends. She tried to steal from a hedge fund.\"\\n\\nJurors heard evidence that Ms. Sorokin duped a close friend into paying for her and two others to take a luxury vacation in Morocco, talked City Bank National into forking over $100,000 and persuaded the executive of a private jet company to let her fly on credit. She also ran up large tabs at luxury hotels and restaurants that she never paid.\\n\\nEven with her conviction, her foiled pursuit of a jet-set lifestyle netted her a prize: an upcoming series on Netflix produced by Shonda Rhimes, the creator of the popular television show \"Grey\\'s Anatomy.\"\\n\\nDreams of owning a nightclub\\n\\nIn the fall of 2015, she befriended Gabriel Andres Calatrava, an architect and the son of Santiago Calatrava, an architect who designed the Oculus, the birdlike centerpiece of the World Trade Center transit hub.\\n\\nThe younger Calatrava testified that he was trying to build his portfolio when Ms. Sorokin told him of her plans to open a private club called A.D.F., for the Anna Delvey Foundation. She said it would be similar to Soho House New York with a bar, a nightclub and an art exhibit. He agreed to design it.\\n\\nAs she did with other people, Ms. Sorokin persuaded Mr. Calatrava that she had a trust fund and was worth 60 million euros, he said.\\n\\nIn reality, Ms. Sorokin did not have a cent to her name, prosecutors said. Her father is reportedly a former truck driver from Russia who runs a heating and cooling business in Germany and had supported her for years. She had left home for an internship in Paris at Purple magazine, then relocated to New York in 2014.\\n\\nMr. Calatrava said Ms. Sorokin settled on 281 Park Avenue South as the site of her club -- a six-story New York City landmark building with a copper and terra-cotta roof, marble mosaic floors and stained glass windows. The project was to cost up to $40 million.\\n\\nShe began negotiations with the landlord, while her lawyer at the time, Andrew Lance, sought financial assistance from hedge funds and banks, prosecutors said.\\n\\nOne bank, City National, had already turned down Ms. Sorokin\\'s request for a $22 million loan when a banker there could not determine the source of her wealth, prosecutors said.\\n\\nShe forged financial statements and lied about her family and her name, evidence at the trial showed. She even made up a fictional accountant and a fake financial adviser with email addresses that were traced back to Ms. Sorokin, prosecutors said. Whenever discussions about money would arise, she would vow to wire funds from her account in Germany. Yet no money was ever transferred.\\n\\n\"Why would someone whose intent is other than criminal take all of these actions?\" the lead prosecutor, Catherine McCaw, said this week. \"Making up fake accountants, making up fake documents -- those are not white lies.\"\\n\\nEventually, after Ms. Sorokin failed to show proof that she could afford the project, Mr. Calatrava said he stopped working with her. The landlord of the building also stopped communicating with her after she failed to make a payment, prosecutors said.\\n\\nBilking a bank out of $100,000\\n\\nStill, Ms. Sorokin continued to pursue millions of dollars in loans for the failed club project from various banks and hedge funds, including Fortress Investment Group, the evidence presented at trial showed.\\n\\nShe talked an executive with City National Bank, Ryan Salem, into giving her a line of credit on her account for $100,000, and promised to repay it with a wire transfer from a European account, he testified.\\n\\nThen, Ms Sorokin used the money in a failed attempt to secure a $25 million loan from Fortress Investment Group, prosecutors said.\\n\\nBut Spencer Garfield, a managing director at Fortress, testified that Ms. Sorokin ran into problems providing details about the origin of her wealth. For starters, she claimed to be born in Germany, but her passport showed she was from a Russian town.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Garfield volunteered to go to Switzerland to meet her banker there, Ms. Sorokin abruptly withdrew from the deal, telling him her father would just give her the money, he said. Fortress returned $55,000 of the money she had provided to secure a loan.\\n\\nBut instead of returning the money to City National Bank, she spent it on herself. In February 2017, she squandered $40,000 on expensive clothing and five-star hotels, evidence showed. By March, her bank balance was negative $9,000, Ms. McCaw said.\\n\\nThat same month, Ms. Sorokin checked into a luxury SoHo hotel, 11 Howard, where she stayed in a $400-per-night room, not far from the apartment of a close friend, Rachel Williams, then a young photo editor at Vanity Fair.\\n\\nA trip to Marrakesh\\n\\nThe two had met in the winter of 2016 through mutual friends at Happy Ending, a restaurant-lounge on Broome Street. Ms. Williams testified she had known Ms. Sorokin as a familiar face within New York City\\'s party scene.\\n\\nThey often dined together at Le Coucou, a restaurant at the hotel, where Ms. Sorokin would always charge the meal to her room. Ms. Williams testified that at first she offered to help pay, but Ms. Sorokin refused, saying, \"You work harder for your money than I do.\"\\n\\n.\\n\\nWhen they went out with friends Ms. Sorokin would frequently offer to pay for a round of drinks and then claim to have forgotten her credit card, Ms. Williams said. Ms. Sorokin then would \"discreetly\" ask her to cover the cost, offering to pay her back, but she never did.\\n\\nIn May 2017, Ms. Sorokin and Ms. Williams traveled to Marrakesh with two other people. Ms. Sorokin said she would pay for the trip, Ms. Williams testified, but then claimed there was a problem with her credit card.\\n\\nMs. Williams said she ended up covering the $62,000 cost of the flights, dining, shopping and their stay at La Mamounia, a hotel where they had a private villa with a courtyard, a pool and a butler -- \"all the extravagance fit for a Kardashian.\"\\n\\nAfter the trip, Ms. Williams said she spent months trying to get her money back. Eventually, Ms. Sorokin paid her $5,000, and again promised that more would arrive from imaginary wire transfers. Ms. Williams said she turned to the police, but they were little help. (Ms. Williams wrote about her experience for Vanity Fair, and has since secured deals with HBO and for a book.)\\n\\nIn the end, however, the jury found Ms. Sorokin not guilty of stealing from Ms. Williams.\\n\\nMs. Sorokin bounced from hotel to hotel. Staff members at 11 Howard locked her out of her room for failing to pay, prosecutors said. The Beacon Hotel lost $11,000. She was forced to leave the W Hotel after she failed to put a credit card on file.\\n\\nShe was quickly running out of options.\\n\\nOne day in July 2017, at a restaurant inside of the hotel Le Parker Meridien, Ms. Sorokin ate and drank for up to six hours, prosecutors said. When it came time to pay her bill, none of her credit cards would work.\\n\\nShe then told hotel staff members that her aunt was on her way from Germany and would cover the bill. The police showed up instead and arrested her for nonpayment of a bill that was less than $200.\\n\\n\"Anna was buying time,\" her lawyer, Mr. Spodek said. \"Things always worked out for her. Anna believed the money was going to come in and she was going to be able to make everyone whole.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jan_ransom@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Jan Ransom', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/nyregion/26sorokin-print1/00sorokin1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4744457', 'sentiment': 0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 1743}\n",

Her account was bolstered by Sean Wellock, a Missouri-based immigration attorney representing the asylum-seeker she was accompanying. Wellock asked that certain details regarding his client not be made public. \"Reneé\" is a young person from Central America, currently facing credible threats of violence in Mexico, Wellock told The Intercept, threats that are now exacerbated by a Trump administration policy of sending asylum-seekers to Mexico as their cases proceed.\\n\\nWellock took on Reneé\\'s case after learning that he had recently been forcibly turned away from the Lukeville port of entry. With Adlerstein acting as an observer on the ground, Wellock took steps to insure that Reneé would be able to exercise his right, under U.S. and international law, to apply for asylum. On Friday night, Wellock called the Lukeville port to inform officials there that he was Reneé\\'s attorney and that Reneé would be coming to the port to seek asylum. The official who picked up the phone said the port was at capacity and wouldn\\'t have room at that time.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Wellock called the port again. This time, he was able to speak to a CBP supervisor by the name of Noriega, who said that Reneé could come to the port to request asylum and that her agency did not have a policy of turning away asylum-seekers. With a signed immigration form and a cover letter from Wellock in hand, Reneé walked up to the port of entry with Adlerstein trailing behind shortly before 3 p.m. Noriega informed the pair that the facility was at capacity and to return in a couple of hours.\\n\\nAt approximately 5 p.m., Reneé and Adlerstein returned. As Reneé crossed the yellow line marking the beginning of U.S. soil, Adlerstein said, an officer demanded they stop. It was at that point that a new supervisor -- with the last name Williams -- came \"rushing out,\" asking his subordinate if there was \"one or two.\" Ultimately, Adlerstein recalled, Williams determined that there was \"one and an illegal alien smuggler.\"\\n\\nThe pair was taken into a CBP building. Adlerstein asked repeatedly if she was being placed under arrest. \"Yes, I\\'m arresting you,\" she recalls Williams telling her. \"I know you\\'re recording this, you can record this, I don\\'t care.\" (Adlerstein was not recording -- she did not bring her phone to the port.) Adlerstein said Williams accused her of \"illegal alien smuggling\" and a second officer made specific reference to \"1324,\" the criminal statute for human smuggling, the same statute under which Scott Warren, a humanitarian aid volunteer in nearby Ajo, Arizona, is currently facing 20 years in prison.\\n\\n\"You are smuggling, you can be arrested for this,\" Adlerstein recalls being told. \"You don\\'t know the law.\"\\n\\nAt the time, Adlerstein was carrying a signed letter from an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, explaining that she is a U.S. citizen and would not answer questions once her citizenship was established. Adlerstein says she told the CBP officer that if she was being placed under arrest, she wanted to speak to her attorney, whose phone number was on the letter. According to Adlerstein, Williams took the letter, tossed it on a desk, and said, \"Tell your lawyer to come down here. We\\'ll arrest him too.\"\\n\\nAdlerstein was moved to a concrete cell, where she says she was subjected to what she described as an \"invasive\" body search by a female guard. Reneé was moved to a separate cell. On the outside, Wellock scrambled to find information on his client. \"I didn\\'t hear anything for several hours,\" he said. At one point, during a call to the processing center, a CBP officer told Wellock that he was not authorized to provide information to attorneys, and he would need to call the agency\\'s Tucson office.\\n\\n\"I was also concerned that Ana might be in trouble too,\" Wellock said.\\n\\nBack in the detention center, Adlerstein said multiple officers repeatedly told her that she had no Fourth Amendment rights and that \"things are different at the border.\" Three hours into her detention, she was presented with a form that would authorize the government to call her family to let them know that she was \"safe\" -- Adlerstein\\'s mother was woken up by the call at approximately 11 p.m. ET.', 'source': {'uri': 'theintercept.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Intercept'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'ryan_devereaux@theintercept.com', 'name': 'Ryan Devereaux', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/05/sonoyta-border-fence-mexico-us-1557412155-e1557412209764.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 1721}\n",

We\\'ve talked policy with Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand over beers, and watched Kamala Harris work the crowd at a bar in Indianola. We\\'ve been in what once would have been \"smoke-filled rooms\" with Steve Bullock and Cory Booker. We\\'ve been stuffed into what seemed like enormous mosh pits oozing with adoring fans of Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nThe Iowa caucus offers Democrats an opportunity to hone their pitch to rural America. Some of the biggest problems around here are in agriculture and trade -- yet in those areas, several candidates seem clueless. One appears to know so little it would make a sixth grader in 4-H roll her eyes. Another was smart enough to speak to a small gathering of progressive farmers but not thoughtful enough to take questions or engage. Bernie Sanders came pretty close last week by going after multinationals\\' near-monopolies.\\n\\nA strong Democratic platform with realistic plans for rural America would focus on four themes: demography, infrastructure, farm sustainability and environmental practices that can help combat climate change.\\n\\nUp to about 30 percent of Iowa\\'s economy is tied directly to agriculture and related industries. The lucky farmer is in limbo; the unlucky one is itemizing inventory for the farm auction. Years of low commodity prices were a nightmare, and President Trump\\'s tariffs made a bad situation worse. Farmers -- particularly young ones -- are losing their land, and older ones are simply hanging it up. As one farmer here told us, \"It\\'s too much work to lose money at it.\"\\n\\nAs young people flee for jobs elsewhere, many towns are dying or already dead. With improved technology and plant genetics, it takes fewer people to grow crops for America and the rest of the world. This is an unspoken topic that shapes the discussions rural Iowans want to have with the candidates. Because what lies ahead for rural America is county consolidation and more school mergers. Communities will lose more hospitals, hometown banks and manufacturing companies. Walmart devastated much of the retail base in the 1980s and \\'90s, and Amazon is destroying what\\'s left. Toss in rural poverty on top of that.\\n\\nA helpful federal plan would work with local and state governments to direct infrastructure improvements and the like to \"opportunity zones\" with growth potential. Those communities are often the ones that have a thriving hospital and an institution of higher learning.\\n\\nIn places with a strong manufacturing base, housing can be scarce. Here in Marion County, which is southeast of Des Moines, there is a lot of demand for housing from workers in manufacturing jobs. But developers are tough to attract: There isn\\'t much money in building 50 houses in Knoxville, Pleasantville or Pella, compared with constructing hundreds in the Des Moines metro. A federal plan could encourage housing in places like this.\\n\\nRural hubs will survive with investment. Communities that want to invest in themselves, develop creative strategies for growth, and partner with regional development efforts should be supported.\\n\\nSome south central Iowa manufacturing towns have hundreds of employees who come from surrounding counties, or even Missouri. That pattern of labor flow is common in rural America. If 40 employees can gather in a dirt lot at a highway intersection in the half-hour before shift change and travel together on a bus to work and back, that\\'s good for the environment and for the rural pocketbook.\\n\\nRural infrastructure offers great opportunity for jobs and development: invest in our farm-to-market roads, the lock and dam systems on our great heartland rivers, and the rapid development of rural broadband.\\n\\nDemocrats have an opportunity to put forward a smart approach to immigration. Manufacturers and farm operations need workers, but President Trump has so demonized the immigrant work force that Republicans won\\'t soon offer anything like a solution.\\n\\nThe Iowa Business Council, made up of 23 executives from Iowa\\'s largest employers, recently stressed the need for the state to modernize the immigration system to help expand the economy. Iowa is not alone: Washington State doesn\\'t want apples rotting on the ground for lack of pickers; Wisconsin worries about small dairy operations desperate for people to milk the cows.\\n\\nDon\\'t demonize \"Big Ag\" and factory farms. It\\'s just liberal white noise to most involved in agriculture. Most of our farms are family-owned, not big agricultural corporations, even if they are integrated into the larger systems to one degree or another. Most need that integration to survive.\\n\\nOf course there\\'s plenty about agriculture policy to rant about. Over the past several decades, the four largest pork packers, beef packers, soybean crushers and wet corn processors have captured 71 percent to 86 percent of their respective markets. Four companies control 90 percent of the global grain trade.\\n\\nCongress let this happen. We need legislation that revives competition in the agricultural economy.\\n\\nThe Green New Deal, even with its flaws, is a good place to start. The Plains States are among the leaders in solar and wind power. Equally important is inviting farmers to lead the charge in fighting global warming. Farmers can help keep carbon out of the atmosphere through a process called carbon sequestration, a natural result of the right farming practices. These include planting cover crops, leaving organic matter in fields after harvest, rotating in additional kinds of crops and managing grazing. Current farm policy pits conservation efforts against maximizing production.\\n\\nPolicy that stabilizes the farm economy costs pennies per meal; so would compensating farmers for environmental services. This would help all farmers, as well as improve our air, water and soil quality. At a recent Sunday meeting at a Presbyterian church nearby, farmers complained that current farm policies favor those who skip conservation and punish those who do the right thing.\\n\\nRural voters also care about values. Many Iowans are people of faith, a majority of them Christian. Democratic candidates, if they look, will find a rising movement on the Christian left that is dismayed that a powerful segment of the Christian right has hijacked the faith and that it is being used as a rationale to deny refugees relief and immigrants jobs and to marginalize the sick, the poor and the hungry.\\n\\nThe candidates -- including the newcomer Beto O\\'Rourke -- have a great opportunity this month to embrace these issues at the Heartland Forum at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake. If Democrats are willing to listen to rural America and offer policies that address our problems, they can succeed in Iowa.\\n\\nRelatedMore about rural America.Opinion | Robert LeonardTrump Has Sucker-Punched Farmers.

I actually had a pageant this Saturday, but it didn\\'t go that well. I didn\\'t get the place that I wanted. I\\'m going up for Miss Alamo next year. My parents didn\\'t really support me at first. They don\\'t really support me, but I still do it.\\n\\nWhen I started hearing the news about Trump, it really did scare me. But knowing my parents, they\\'re like, \"Oh no, if they deport us, we\\'re going to come back.\" And they\\'re actually trying to fix their papers now.\\n\\nI see my parents have to go through the stress.Isabella Ruiz, 14, a freshman in McAllen, wants to become a veterinarian. Her father, who is undocumented, was arrested in December and held at Port Isabel Detention Center, operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 60 miles east of McAllen. He was released in January, but the family has struggled financially since then: their water was shut off for lack of payment, and they had to carry bottles and buckets from her grandfather\\'s house.\\n\\nWhen my dad was in jail, my mom, she would have to pay all the bail bonds and everything. So at one point we didn\\'t have water for, like, two weeks. We would have to go over there to take showers, and then put the water in the buckets. We\\'d fill them up over there and then put them back in the car and then bring them down.\\n\\nMy mom transports people to dialysis or wherever they need to go. My dad works as a cook in a restaurant.\\n\\nI see my parents have to go through the stress. My mom wants to find a second job. I just feel bad because they have to do all this stuff, and I\\'m not 16 yet, so I can\\'t help them. As soon as I turn 16, I want to put in my applications so I can help them with the bills and everything. I mean, school comes first, but I\\'m planning on working and doing school so I can help them out. My mom has always told me, \"You\\'re going to go to college.\" I know it\\'s going to be a struggle, but I have to go. I want to do something with my life. I don\\'t want to struggle as much as my parents did to support their family.\\n\\nWhen my dad was in ICE, I didn\\'t really want to go out or anything.\\n\\nOne time, my friend asked me to go and I said no, but then my mom made me, because she saw how I was just here at the house. We would go visit him sometimes, but then it would make me more sad because I would just see him through a glass. When he got released, we were there waiting. I just saw him get out of the van and I just ran to him. Me and my mom ran to him and he hugged us, and I just started crying.\\n\\nI miss out on a lot of things because I don\\'t live over there.Jocelyn Guzman, 18, lives in Matamoros, Mexico, but crosses the border to attend high school in Brownsville. She is a United States citizen. Her mother, who earns the equivalent of $100 a week at a Mexican auto-parts factory, spends half her salary on the vans that transport Jocelyn back and forth across the bridges.\\n\\nI have to wake up at 4, or sometimes when I\\'m really sleepy I wake up at 4:10 in the morning. My mom takes me to the store that\\'s really near from here, S Mart. I get in a little van that takes us to school every day.\\n\\nFrom home to school, with all that, I think it takes me maybe two hours. I\\'m also counting the line that there is on the puente, the bridge. I get to school around 7:40. First and second, I love those two periods. They teach us everything about nursing. At the end of the year, if I get certified, I\\'m going to be certified as a patient care technician. I\\'ve learned how to do EKGs. Right now we\\'re into phlebotomy.\\n\\nThe bell rings at 4:05, and that\\'s when I walk to get in the van and come home. We meet up next to Family Dollar and we meet up with the other vans.\\n\\nI go to bed sometimes at 10 when I don\\'t have a lot of homework. But when I study for a test I go to bed really late. I go to bed around 12 or 1. Sometimes I\\'m really sleepy in school and it\\'s hard. Sometimes teachers can see you differently or judge you, so I don\\'t tell many people that I go back and forth. Sometimes I miss out on a lot of things because I don\\'t live over there. And I don\\'t live over there because my parents can\\'t live over there with me. They\\'re not U.S. citizens.\\n\\nLike my mom said, my dad, always, he fights for what he wants. And I\\'ve learned that from him. My goal is to finish school, go to college, finish college, and I want to work and I want to get paid money, so I can help them move over there with me. I want to pay them back.\\n\\nWhite suburbs and big cities: I\\'m like, how boring.Emily Gurwitz, 18, a senior in McAllen, is a ballet dancer, soccer-team captain and Hebrew-school teacher at her synagogue. In her college admissions essay, she summed up being Jewish in a Mexican-American city at the Texas border by coining a phrase to describe herself: a Jewish Texican.\\n\\nI was at this summer thing. It\\'s called the Welch Summer Scholar program. I did research at U.T. for five weeks. So I lived in a dorm, and it was just me and eight other juniors in high school. It was right around the time when a lot of stuff started happening at the border. We would turn on the news and it would be in McAllen, and they were like, \"Emily, this is so crazy, you\\'re from McAllen.\"\\n\\nIt seems so crazy, but if you\\'re in McAllen, you\\'re just in McAllen. There\\'s nothing so dramatic happening, like it seems on the news. People just associate McAllen as this, like, border wasteland or something, where there\\'s, like, nothing happening except detention of illegal immigrants or something. But that\\'s not what it\\'s like at all. We have great education, great social life, great community. McAllen is so cool. The people I was with this summer are from mostly wealthy, very white suburbs and big cities: I\\'m like, how boring.\\n\\nI started volunteering at the migrant respite center with my friends. One day I made sandwiches for three hours.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t go to the respite center, you will never see the people who are crossing the border. I guess I was the most touched by the kids who were there who are my age. Because once you turn 18, you\\'re, like, an adult, and so you have to have one of those ankle monitors on. And this girl had just showered and she put on her new clothes, and she was like, \"Oh, I need a pair of scissors,\" in Spanish. And I had handed them to her and I was like, what could she possibly need scissors for? And she had to cut her pants because she couldn\\'t get it over the ankle monitor. And she\\'s, like, my age. Imagine what she\\'s gone through just to get here. And now she can\\'t just be normal.\\n\\nI want to join the military like my mom did.Gaby Brown, 15, a freshman in McAllen, celebrated her quinceañera with relatives from both Mexico and the United States. Her mother is Hispanic, her father is white and her mother\\'s boyfriend, whom she calls her stepfather, is Hispanic. She supports the president\\'s idea to expand the border wall.\\n\\nMe and my mom are always going on about it. Honestly, I think it\\'s a good idea. Coming out and saying that we need it, I honestly think we really do need it.\\n\\nI want to join the military like my mom did. I want to go into the Army, but she wants me to go into the Air Force, because she says that\\'s the safer side. And then when I get out, I want to go into the medical field, like helping other people with their mental problems. Growing up, my mom has been through a whole bunch of stress because of the military. She has PTSD. And I have depression and anxiety. I want to help someone else that has those problems as well.\\n\\nMusic\\'s a real big factor in my life. It helps me cope with my problems. When I get upset I kind of tune out the world and just listen to music. I listen to indies, R&B, hip-hop, rap, country, Mexican music, everything.\\n\\nWhen I see Border Patrol, I think about them taking my parents.Beverly Godinez, 16, a junior in Alamo, is a member of the junior R.O.T.C. program and spends her summers doing missionary work in Michoacán in western Mexico. Her mother and father are both undocumented.\\n\\nWhen I think about them taking my parents, I feel anger. When I see Border Patrol, I think about them taking my parents. It makes things kind of difficult in a way.\\n\\nA few weeks back, when we were taking my sister to Laredo, we got stopped by a police officer. I know that they can\\'t do nothing about it, because they\\'re not Border Patrol. But it kind of gets you nervous. It was because one of my sisters didn\\'t have the seatbelt on, so they pulled us over.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to graduate with honors and get my associate\\'s. We have a program here in high school where they give you the opportunity to take college classes, and if you complete those college classes that go with your major, you can graduate with your associate\\'s. Now I come home and I don\\'t even turn on the TV or anything, I just go straight to do homework.\\n\\nThere are people in my school and they kind of, like, discriminate. Actually, I got in a fight. Well, not in a fight, but an argument with this kid, because he was making fun of this girl for not being able to speak English.\\n\\nThis was a few weeks ago. We were in a classroom and I was sitting in the corner because I was charging my phone. He was talking English, so that she couldn\\'t understand. I think that\\'s why I stepped in, because she couldn\\'t talk for herself. And I got in the way, and I was, like, telling him off. I was calling him ignorant. And he was like, \"Oh yes, you know what the word \\'ignorant\\' means,\" like calling me stupid. And then he stayed quiet. I was mad, so I just stayed quiet, too.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'ilana_panich_linsman@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Ilana Panich-Linsman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'manny_fernandez@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Manny Fernandez', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/04/us/04valleygirls-gaby/00VALLEYGIRLS-slide-155W-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1215686274509804, 'wgt': 1675}\n",

The road to a Wall Street leadership role in an industry that remains male-dominated is paved with challenges, detours, and cultivating experiences that have shaped my career and leadership style. I hope that by sharing a glimpse into my journey, I can perhaps illuminate a path for others.\\n\\nGrowing up in Israel, I was given the gift of reading by my parents who sought to continually improve our collective lives. Whether immersing in the adventures of Jules Verne, exploring history or acquiring knowledge, I learned to develop points of views and advocacy for causes, planting the seeds of a career in law.\\n\\nIt was in high school after we immigrated to the US that those seeds took root. Reading \"Compulsion,\" a story about the legal defense by the renowned civil liberties lawyer, Clarence Darrow, of the Leopold and Loeb murder case, encouraged me to enter law school with the dream of making my mark on the jurisprudence system. While interning in a corporate law firm, I was also drawn to the world of finance.\\n\\nThis shift in interest was not embraced by my parents, who as small-business owners, encouraged us to pursue a more stable profession, such as law, medicine or accounting. Yet, my career in law was short-lived, as I joined Lehman Brothers, an investment bank newly spun out of American Express, to get closer to the business side. Under the mantra of \"success begets success,\" Lehman rose through the league tables and I was fortunate to learn the craft from the industry\\'s best practitioners. And while Lehman did not make its stated goal of reaching $150 per share, I loved the firm and the profession. I was and still am passionate about my clients.Read more: When my spouse got the job of a lifetime, my world crashed. This is how I fought my way out of it and reinvented my career\\n\\nA career in Wall Street, while rewarding intellectually and financially, also comes with sacrifices and challenges. Last year I grappled with an existential professional question: Is my passion still there?\\n\\nMy current role as the global head of technology investment banking group is exhilarating. Technology is foundational to the digital transformation underpinning every modern organization. Whether shepherding next gen leaders into the public markets, or advising on mergers and acquisitions that reshape the landscape, the sector\\'s dynamism mandates continued agility and creativity. My role also allows me to imbue in my team the art of the trade, and pass on my fervor for the business.\\n\\nThese experiences also presented me with the opportunity to join a public board, where I leverage the knowledge I have garnered to be a trusted advocate to our shareholders.\\n\\nWhile pursuing a career, I also raised a family. Or more accurately, we raised a family. As well as a loving support system, my husband has always advocated for me and offered his hand, shoulder, and so much more when I stumbled or felt defeated and unappreciated.\\n\\nSo how did I become a not-so-accidental feminist? Well, it first depends on how you define one. I come from a line of strong women. My maternal grandmother fled her home at age 14 to escape the Nazis, and my paternal grandmother immigrated to a budding nation occupied by the Brits, not the start-up nation of today. My mother and sister are my rock, just like rock-star girlfriends, who did not view vulnerabilities as weaknesses. Together, we channeled our ambitions, frustrations, and disappointments to charge ahead and reach new highs.\\n\\nI also married a man who supported my passion as well as dedicated his career to women\\'s health. I am proud, too, to work with confident, smart, forward-thinking men that serve as partners, mentors, champions and friends.\\n\\nMy generation of women burned the candle on both ends, which didn\\'t allow for time to think about feminism. But we believed that we could have it all, and in fact, were practicing feminism. Only when my kids went off to college did I find the time to nurture the next generation of women, pay it forward and pray they find the journey easier, learn from our mistakes and define the world they want to live in.Read more: This is what happens to a woman\\'s body when she\\'s raising kids, working, and trying to have it all, according to a hormone doctor who warns it\\'s easy to miss the signs of impending burnout\\n\\nI grew up thinking that if you develop a skill set, work hard and keep your head down, you will be recognized and rewarded.

The main wildcard remains the political environment, as we do not see the government surviving its five-year term. The other wildcard is a financial crisis if markets\\' confidence in Italy deteriorates quickly.\\n\\n\"A financial crisis that brings down the current government could lead to a new unity government which implements fiscal tightening, further depressing growth,\" Nobile says. \"This situation cannot last.\"\\n\\nCapital\\'s Allen lays out this analysis of Italy\\'s problems:\\n\\nExtremely low productivity growth, in part, because Italy has not invested in technology the way the US or the UK has. In 2017, only 61% of Italians were on the internet, compared to 95% in UK, according to the World Bank. The Italian labour force is shrinking, and immigration won\\'t make up the difference. Italy is a haven for lousy management and corporate governance, according to the WEF Global Competitiveness Report. There is more government corruption in Italy than other European economies. And the Italian legal system is slow to enforce or defend the rights of litigants. Italian companies still have weak access to credit and capital. Rigid labour market rules make companies afraid to hire people they can\\'t get rid of later. The quantity and quality of education is too low. Italian 15-year-olds perform below the average tracked by the OECD. Poorly educated workers tend to be less productive.\\n\\nFoto: The percentage of Italians who are connected to the internet is lower than in most other Western countries.sourceCapital Economics\\n\\nIn addition, Nobile says, the limited deficit-spending headroom that Italy is allowed has been spent on the wrong projects. For instance, the EU allowed the government a little extra spending room last year, and the government put €10 billion into early retirement benefits and a basic income scheme.\\n\\nThose might be good for unemployed people and pensioners, but they aren\\'t the kind of capital or educational investments that Italy needs to restructure its economy for growth, he says.\\n\\nItalians were richer than Americans until they switched to the euro\\n\\nItaly was not always this way.\\n\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Italians were richer, on a purchasing power parity basis, than Americans. They managed that because Italy used the lira, and the currency was competitively devalued. It made Italian goods and services cheap, and spurred growth.\\n\\nFoto: Italy grew so wealthy on a per-head basis that in the 1980s and 1990s it surpassed the US. But then the country switched its currency to the euro, and it lost its competitive edge.sourceCapital Economics\\n\\nNow Italy uses the euro, and it cannot devalue its currency. The country could only do that if it left the eurozone and reinstated the lira.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Italy\\'s \"obligations\" inside the ECB\\'s euro transaction clearing system are approaching €500 billion, according to the ECB. Technically, that is debt Italy must pay immediately if it defaults out of the euro. It is the equivalent of about a third of Italian GDP.\\n\\nSo that situation is extremely unlikely.\\n\\nFoto: Italy owes €483 billion in obligations inside the ECB\\'s euro transaction clearing system -- a debt that in theory must be paid immediately if Italy ever left the euro.sourceECB\\n\\nItaly\\'s problems are so intractable, and so big, that analysts are theorizing about what it would take to break up the eurozone. It\\'s an outside chance. The possibility of Italy leaving the eurozone is 5% or less, Nobile told Business Insider.\\n\\nBut he estimates the chance of a Greek-style financial crisis at 25% to 30%.\\n\\n\"Italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than Greece. I think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion\"\\n\\nThe crisis has been a long time coming, of course, so haven\\'t banks made sure to reduce their exposure to Italian debt? One of the reasons the Greek crisis was largely confined to Greece was because the private finance sphere successfully insulated itself from exposure to Greek debt.\\n\\n\"Italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than Greece,\" Allen told Business Insider. \"I think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion.\"\\n\\nRead more about the Italian debt crisis:\\n\\nThe European Union\\'s subversion of democracy contributed to the recession in Italy Europe is faltering Europe\\'s austerity rule is a political decision to go into recession The sheer scale of Italy\\'s debt threatens global GDP', 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jim_edwards@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'Jim Edwards', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cbb16efd1a2f84a0a269575-1136-568.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.3803921568627451, 'wgt': 1410}\n",

It came six weeks after a jury found Mr. Taubert guilty of threatening to kill a former United States president, transmitting a threat in interstate commerce and making a threat to influence, impede or retaliate against a federal official.\\n\\nThe jury also found that Mr. Taubert chose to make threats against Mr. Obama and Ms. Waters, two black Democratic Party leaders, because of their race, a distinction that allowed prosecutors to seek an enhanced sentence.\\n\\n\"Racist threats to kill present and former public officials are not protected free speech, but serious crimes,\" Grant C.

She specifically told them to \"show up\" wherever they had to, \"create a crowd\" and \"push back.\"\\n\\nSome conservatives took issue with her comments, arguing that \"push back\" had a physical connotation that was tantamount to inciting assault.\\n\\nTwo days after Ms. Waters\\'s remarks, President Trump joined in the criticism, writing on Twitter that the California congresswoman had called for \"harm\" to his supporters. Then he warned her to \"be careful what you wish for.\"\\n\\nRoughly a month after Mr. Trump\\'s tweet, Mr. Taubert called Ms. Waters\\'s office in Los Angeles. Using pejorative slurs for women and African-Americans, he said that he planned to attend all of Ms. Waters\\'s public events and vowed to kill her and her staff, prosecutors said.\\n\\nWhen asked about that call by police officers, Mr. Taubert repeated his racial slur against her, according to court papers. He also called Ms. Waters \"low I.Q.\", a comment that mirrored the language of Mr. Trump\\'s tweet.\\n\\nThe call to Ms. Waters\\'s office came 13 months after Mr. Taubert made multiple calls to the Washington office of Al Franken, then a Democratic senator from Minnesota.

In contrast to other formerly quiet Northern California backwaters, Mendocino maintains its rural identity and eccentricities, including its longstanding status as one of the country\\'s major marijuana-producing regions. Where there is big news, it\\'s largely culinary. The 30-year-old chef at Elk\\'s Harbor House Inn was recently named a James Beard award semifinalist for Best Chef in the West. Besides the Harbor House\\'s eight- to 12-course, $150 per person prix fixe dinners, there are cheesemakers, upstart breweries, exceptional farm stands -- notably Fort Bragg\\'s Nye Ranch and Caspar\\'s Fortunate Farm -- and farm-inspired restaurants, like the long-awaited, soon-to-open Fog Eater Cafe, which began as a farm pop-up, and will serve \"California cuisine with a Southern twang.\" After years of population stagnation, young people are moving in, or coming home, and committing themselves to Mendocino\\'s fertile soil and sea. It\\'s a second wave back-to-the-land movement and a welcome reprieve from the Bay Area\\'s buzz.\\n\\nFriday1) 3:30 p.m. Tall trees\\n\\nTake Highway 128 through the Anderson Valley, to Hendy Woods State Park, where you can stretch your legs beneath the awe-inspiring giant redwoods or take a dip in the Navarro River. Then, backtrack to Boonville\\'s Pennyroyal Farm, the sister farmstead to one of Mendocino\\'s most beloved wineries, Navarro Vineyards. Sample rich goat and sheep milk cheeses, fresh and aged, exceptional pinot noir, and farm-made pickles and preserves. Sit out back, beside a gurgling fountain, and watch sheep meander beneath the vines. In the spring, a farm tour (11 a.m. daily) offers the overwhelming cuteness of nursing lambs and kids.\\n\\n2) 6 p.m. Supper stop\\n\\nFor dinner, reserve a table at the Boonville Hotel, a former roadhouse that\\'s now a beautiful, family-owned inn with a wide porch, flickering fireplaces when the weather\\'s cool, and a seductive patio garden for outdoor dining during the warm months. The restaurant\\'s new chef, Perry Hoffman, is from Sonoma\\'s James Beard award-winning SHED and, before that, Napa\\'s Michelin-starred Étoile. Here, his prix-fixe menus (starting at $58) include lively dishes and unexpected flavor combinations. Imagine mussels with charred cabbage, grapefruit, fennel and seaweed or a whole stuffed quail with artichokes, shiitake mushrooms, bolting kale and brown rice vinegar.\\n\\n3) 9 p.m. Change is brewing\\n\\nAfter winding through the redwoods and along the coast, head for the former logging town of Fort Bragg, for some small town night life. The 135-year-old Golden West is a dive bar that was bought in 2015 by a couple who grew up locally and returned after living in Los Angeles. The bar has maintained its vintage character (neon signs, shuffleboard and pool tables, faded black-and-white photos of logging scenes) while upgrading its extensive liquor cabinet and serving excellent cocktails, and has occasional but unexpectedly good live music, as well as a Sunday Bloody Mary bar. Or, for a family-friendly pub in a tucked-away location, seek out Mendocino\\'s newest brewery, Overtime Brewery, which teams with Nye Ranch in making its exotic seasonal beers, like the \"Thistle Dew\" artichoke ale or Nye Ranch Cucumber Batch. Take a couple of crowlers -- a 32-ounce can filled from the tap and sealed on site -- of your favorite beer to go.\\n\\nSaturday4) 8 a.m. Super bloom\\n\\nTucked into a strip mall, Cafe Jaavy -- the younger sister of the longtime local favorite, Los Gallitos -- has colorful oilcloth tablecloths, a salsa bar and a breakfast menu that includes savory Mexican breakfasts like chilaquiles (tortilla chips simmered in a flavorful, mildly spicy sauce, served with beans and eggs, $9.50) and standout huevos rancheros with chorizo ($9.50), plus sweeter offerings like banana and berry crepes ($8.99) and generous, smoothies ($4.50) made with fresh fruit. The Tropical, with mango, apple, pineapple, melon, chili and lime is particularly tasty. Then, head for the 47-acre Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens, where 124 species of rhododendrons put on a spectacular show in April and May.\\n\\n5) 11 a.m. Sweet soak\\n\\nDrive south to Mendocino village to walk its photogenic streets and gawk at the immaculately preserved Victorians. Pop into Frankie\\'s for a scoop of locally made Cowlick\\'s ice cream. Among the cafe\\'s 16 rotating flavors are chai, Campari grapefruit sorbet, yellow cake batter and mushroom. Then, take a restorative soak in Sweetwater Spa\\'s communal -- and clothing optional -- eight-person redwood tub, sweat in the cedarwood sauna, or indulge in a massage (starting at $110 for 50 minutes). There are also private tubs ($25 per hour), which are enclosed but open to the sky; if a starry soak is your thing, Sweetwater is open until 9 p.m.\\n\\n6) 12:30 p.m. Pizza pit stop\\n\\nNext door, Cafe Beaujolais\\'s weekend-only takeout window, the Brickery, serves pizza ($13) with big, perfectly charred air pockets and daring toppings, like Moroccan-spiced rabbit and garlicky New Haven-style white clam pizza. On sunny days, the backyard garden is idyllic for sharing a pie and savoring a glass of rosé or a craft cider.\\n\\n7) 2 p.m. Glass for the masses\\n\\nFort Bragg\\'s signature attraction, a former town dump that was transformed by time into a beach of gleaming sea glass, has been badly picked over and is no longer the dazzling sight it once was. For a glimpse of its former glory, head to the odd little International Sea Glass Museum south of town, where Captain Cass sells bags of so-called Seed Glass ($4.50) to replenish the beach\\'s supply. Across Highway 1, the Glass Fire Gallery displays fantastic blown-glass creations in the form of jellyfish chandeliers and mushroom-shaped table lamps. While in the area, go for a stroll along the newly opened Noyo Headlands Coastal Trail. After more than a century of the headlands being occupied by a sprawling mill site, the town now has access to its coastal bluffs, where California poppies blaze orange in the spring, when it\\'s also possible to spot migrating whales spouting offshore.\\n\\nMore on traveling in CaliforniaCalifornia\\'s Highway 1, With Memory Riding ShotgunOct. 1, 2018Discovering Eugene O\\'Neill\\'s San FranciscoOct. 3, 2018Lawrence Ferlinghetti\\'s Enduring San FranciscoMarch 11, 20198) 3:30 p.m. Local treasure\\n\\nFor a dose of Mendocino\\'s wonderful eccentricity, visit The Larry Spring Museum of Common Sense Physics, a tiny two-room storefront museum that celebrates the life and work of the local inventor, lay scientist and World War II transport pilot, Larry Spring. In the same small building, Lost Coast Found has a charming selection of vintage home goods: midcentury stereos, cheery 1970s-era coffee cups, along with used books, postcards and miscellanea.\\n\\n9) 5:30 p.m. Fresh caught\\n\\nHave an early, California-style dinner by the water in Noyo Harbor, where you have a difficult choice of dining options. For fresh, crispy fish and chips, bundle up and sit on the riverside deck at Sea Pal Cove, where dinner guests include sea gulls, there are $5 pints of high-end craft beer, and views of passing fishing -- and, in season, whale-watching -- boats. A few doors down, Princess Seafood Market & Deli is a woman-owned and -run fishing operation with its own boat and seafood restaurant. Princess serves reasonably priced, locally caught seafood, including whole Dungeness crab ($27.95), barbecued Royal Miyagi oysters ($12.95 for a half dozen, and a grilled prawn po boy ($15.95). During chilly coastal evenings, the deli\\'s tented seating area provides heat lamps and freshly laundered blankets. Then, pick up a Coast Packet and take a gamble on a local performance. One of the joys of small town cultural life is the unexpectedness of what\\'s available from week to week, whether it\\'s the wonderful independent Flynn Creek Circus or a riotous political play at the Mendocino Theatre Company.\\n\\nSunday10) 9 a.m. The Greenwood Good Life\\n\\nOn your way through Mendocino, grab a takeout breakfast -- an organic housemade bagel with lox and \"all the veggies\" ($12.50) or \"market-inspired\" quiche ($8) -- at Mendocino\\'s Good Life Cafe. Sip your coffee to-go as you drive a breathtaking stretch of Highway 1 to the village of Elk, population 200. Tote your breakfast down to Greenwood State Beach to sit on a piece of driftwood, look out over the volatile Pacific and take a long breath of sea air. Then, visit Elk Greenwood Museum and Visitor Center -- originally the town\\'s post office -- to learn some Greenwood lore from the center\\'s knowledgeable docents.\\n\\n11) 11 a.m. Wine Down\\n\\nTake Philo-Greenwood Road back to Anderson Valley and taste your way out of town. The options can be overwhelming, but the redwood tasting room at Toulouse Vineyards and Winery is especially beautiful and its wines are excellent renditions of classic local varietals: Alsatian whites and pinot noirs. For three wineries in one Spanish-style plaza, stop at The Madrones complex, where Drew Family Cellars, Smith-Story Winery and the newly opened Long Meadow Ranch, which has estate-grown Burgundian varietals, share a plaza.\\n\\n12) 12:30 p.m. History lesson\\n\\nCut east over Route 253 -- a spectacular 16-mile drive across hilltops of moss-draped California live oaks -- to Ukiah, Mendocino\\'s 16,000-person county seat. Dedicated to an extraordinary, but largely forgotten painter, the Grace Hudson Museum and Sun House displays Hudson\\'s striking and distinctly empathetic portraits of native peoples and immigrants, exhibits the work of local artists, and offers tours of Hudson\\'s Arts and Crafts home, which she called Sun House.\\n\\n13) 2 p.m. Buddhist brunch\\n\\nHead south to the City of 10,000 Buddhas, a former California State Mental Hospital that is now a Buddhist community and monastery. The campus\\'s distinctive arched entrance is undergoing renovation, but its roaming peacocks, evocative institutional architecture and Jyun Kang Vegetarian Restaurant, which serves tasty vegetarian dishes to a mostly local crowd, remain. Or hop down the 101 to Hopland, where Rock Seas serves an ever-changing menu that riffs on brunch classics -- like coconut French Toast with star anise, coconut, brown sugar and mango ($12).\\n\\nLodging\\n\\nIn the last two years, two long-awaited new hotels have opened on the Mendocino coast. The Harbor House Inn, in Elk, is a 1916 redwood home which was originally built by the local logging company and designed to showcase the beauty of the region\\'s lumber. After an eight-year renovation, the inn reopened in May of 2018 with 10 rooms (starting at $355, breakfast included) and a destination restaurant.\\n\\nLocated on a high bank where the Noyo River becomes a harbor, the Noyo Harbor Inn has 15 rooms starting at $199 -- nearly all with wide views of the waterfront or the Pacific.\\n\\nMany of Mendocino\\'s rustic redwood homes have been converted to vacation rentals in recent years. A mile and a half from Mendocino village, pet- and child-friendly Mendocino Treehouse is not only built of redwood, but the octagonal cottage is built around a living tree. Two bedrooms and two bathrooms, starts at $275.\\n\\nFollow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Upon searching her hotel room, investigators found another cellphone and a radio frequency device that detects hidden cameras, Assistant United States Attorney Rolando Garcia said during a bond hearing at the U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach on Monday.\\n\\nShe also had nine U.S.B. drives and five SIM cards in her room at the Colony Hotel, along with several debit cards and about $8,000 in cash, including about $700 in Chinese currency, Mr. Garcia said.\\n\\nMr. Garcia told U.S. Magistrate Judge William Matthewman that Ms. Zhang is a \"serious flight risk\" because she \"lies to everyone that she encounters.\"\\n\\nMs. Zhang had initially told authorities at the club that she carried multiple phones to the resort because she was afraid to leave them in her hotel room, Mr. Garcia said. She had previously told the court in an appearance last week that she had only about $5,000 in the bank.\\n\\n\"Someone who is afraid of her property being stolen at the hotel does not leave so much cash and credit cards in a hotel room,\" Mr. Garcia said.\\n\\nMs. Zhang came to the United States on March 28 from Shanghai on a B-1 visa that has been revoked, meaning that if the court does release her from jail pending trial, she would be transferred to immigration custody, Mr. Garcia said.\\n\\n\"She has really no ties to the Southern District of Florida, or the United States of America, for that matter,\" he said.\\n\\nMs. Zhang\\'s assistant federal public defender, Robert Adler, said in the court hearing that Ms. Zhang did not attempt to hide the four cellphones when she entered the club. He stressed to the judge that she is not charged with espionage.\\n\\n\"We have heard the government has no reason to believe Ms. Zhang was a spy,\" Mr. Adler said.\\n\\nThe Secret Service agent who questioned Ms. Zhang after her arrest, Samuel Ivanovich, said during testimony that she did not carry any lock-picking or eavesdropping gear. His four-and-a-half hour interrogation of Ms. Zhang was recorded by video, Mr. Ivanovich said, but it lacked sound because he didn\\'t realize that the agency\\'s office in Palm Beach didn\\'t have that capability.\\n\\nMr. Ivanovich testified that the computer analyst who reviewed Ms. Zhang\\'s devices said that the thumb drive she was carrying had immediately begun installing a program on his computer.\\n\\n\"He stated that he had to immediately stop the analysis and shut off his computer to halt the corruption,\" Mr. Ivanovich said.\\n\\nMr. Adler said there was nothing to suggest that Ms. Zhang was a spy, but prosecutors said that was irrelevant to the question of whether she should be let out on bond, because that\\'s not what she was charged with.\\n\\n\"What did she actually do?\" Mr. Adler said. \"What she did was the equivalent of saying, \\'My name is Smith, I\\'d like to use the pool.\\'\"\\n\\nThe judge postponed a decision on whether to release her on bond until next week, to give the defense time to bring people from China who could support Ms. Zhang\\'s story.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'frances_robles@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Frances Robles', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/08/us/08maralago/08maralago-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4713840', 'sentiment': -0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 1226}\n",

With the other trees planted at 3-foot intervals alongside, it\\'s part of what he hopes will be before long a lucrative wall of fruit.\\n\\nIf Gilbert lets nature take its course, the tree and thousands like it planted on this 20-acre orchard in Yakima, Wash., later this year will bear the first crop of Cosmic Crisp, which he and other growers in the state are calling a new blockbuster apple. If instead he chooses to interrupt the fruiting, he\\'ll be letting the tree reinvest its energy -- think of it as the horticultural equivalent of compounding interest -- into growing bigger and stronger faster, which may mean more fruit in the long term.\\n\\nIt\\'s a consequential decision: Gilbert Orchards has invested about $900,000 into the single Cosmic Crisp plot on which he\\'s standing. For the 122-year-old family business, Gilbert says, that amounts to a \"big bet.\" The gamble is all the more risky because growers like him have no experience with this cultivar. Everyone agrees that the cherry red, slightly tart, ever-so-juicy Cosmic Crisp is a good apple for eating, he says, and stays fresh as long as a year in storage. \"Everything else is just guessing.\"\\n\\nFor Gilbert Orchards, whose products wind up in fruit bowls as far away as India and Taiwan, the decision on whether to delay the first harvest of Cosmic Crisps is complicated by the uncertainty bred by Donald Trump\\'s trade wars. Mexico and China have hiked duties on U.S. apple imports in response to Trump\\'s policies. India has threatened to follow suit.\\n\\nAcross Washington state\\'s apple orchards, growers\\' exports have fallen almost 30 percent since last spring. \"We\\'ve been through these kinds of things before, but not with as many markets,\" says Mark Powers, president of the Northwest Horticultural Council. \"It\\'s not like we can divert the millions of cartons that are going to India to Costa Rica.\"\\n\\nSpring is supposed to be a time of optimism in rural communities across America. It\\'s when farmers sow the seeds of prosperity into neat, GPS-calibrated rows and when they pray for just the right amount of rain and sun and for prices to hold up so that when fall approaches, there\\'s a crop worth harvesting. This year is different. In Washington apple orchards, North Carolina hog farms, and soybean fields along the Mississippi River Basin, the season is filled with doubt. After taking a hit to their bottom line in 2018 of the sort that some say they haven\\'t seen since the 1980s, farmers in much of the U.S. are hoping for a return to normalcy.\\n\\nTrump\\'s determination to upend the global trading system comes at an inconvenient time for one of the nation\\'s premier export industries. No country has mastered the science of the ever-increasing yield quite like the U.S. has. It\\'s the world\\'s leading producer of commodity crops such as soybeans and corn and a major source of apples, beef, pork, and wheat. Agriculture has also been an important backer of successive administrations\\' push to seal trade agreements around the world. Pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement have spurred agricultural exports, which have grown 170 percent over the past 20 years.\\n\\nYet U.S. farm profits have been shrinking since they peaked six years ago, amounting last year to roughly half what they were in 2013. As a result of successive years of bumper crops, prices for key commodities like soybeans and corn are about 40 percent lower than they were in 2013. At the same time, farmers have had to contend with the administration\\'s crackdown on immigration, which deprives them of migrant labor, and climate change, which most recently took the form of historic floods that devastated Midwestern agricultural states.\\n\\nThe trade wars have come on top of all that. In the year since the Trump administration launched its tariff offensive, the country\\'s trade partners have retaliated by hiking duties on apples, cherries, ginseng, sorghum, and soybeans, to name a few crops. It\\'s a familiar pattern: American farmers have long borne the cost for protectionist policies pushed by the country\\'s industrialists. The 1828 \"tariff of abominations\" designed to safeguard Northern manufacturers from an influx of lower-priced imports from Britain was opposed stridently in the agrarian South. It led to a political crisis that dogged Andrew Jackson\\'s presidency and precipitated South Carolina\\'s first threats of secession.\\n\\nConscious of the support he garnered in farm states in the 2016 election and the costs they\\'ve been bearing, the president last year announced an aid program of as much as $12 billion to cushion their losses. He\\'s also promised his trade wars will eventually be a boon for the U.S. agricultural economy, whether because of additional Chinese purchases of soybeans and other commodities or the further opening of vital markets such as Japan. \"We\\'re doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you\\'re not even going to believe it,\" he told a cheering crowd at the American Farm Bureau Federation\\'s annual meeting in New Orleans in January. \"Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately. We got to plant.\"\\n\\nStill, plenty of people in farm country are fed up with a fight that\\'s only adding to the widening economic gulf between rural and urban America. \"Why should just a few good patriots take it on the chin for the whole of the country?\" asks Larry Wooten, the outspoken president of the North Carolina Farm Bureau.\\n\\nEconomists are still trying to quantify the impact of Trump\\'s pugnacious protectionism on agriculture. One study by researchers at Iowa State University estimated the various tit-for-tat tariffs imposed in 2018 would cost the farm state as much as $2 billion in lost economic activity, much of it in its corn and pork industries.\\n\\nCalculating the drop in export revenue or the collapse in prices for some commodities isn\\'t difficult, but it\\'s harder to pin numbers on other economic consequences, such as stalled investment. Travel through farm country, and it\\'s hard to find a farmer who doesn\\'t have a story about the combine not bought or the orchard not planted.\\n\\nGilbert\\'s business, which employs the equivalent of 800 people full time and counts big-box retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. as domestic customers, has been hit hard by the trade wars. The operation typically exports a third of its production, according to Gilbert, but shipments from the most recent harvest are down 25 percent from the previous year.\\n\\nTrump\\'s trade wars haven\\'t crimped only Gilbert\\'s revenue; they\\'ve also eaten into his future profits. Instead of replanting 180 acres of the 2,000 or so he manages with new varieties like the Cosmic Crisp that fetch premium prices, he scaled back his plans last year to 120 acres.\\n\\nTalk to people in Washington\\'s apple industry, and they mention the Cosmic Crisp alongside the Granny Smith and the Red Delicious as a revolutionary variety two decades in the making. A product of Washington State University (WSU)\\'s crossbreeding program, it\\'s a singularly crunchy apple whose flesh doesn\\'t brown after it\\'s cut. The variety is also robust enough to ship to far-off lands.\\n\\nGrowers in Washington state will have exclusive rights to the Cosmic Crisp until 2027. But Lynnell Brandt, whom WSU hired to manage its commercialization, already has world apple domination in mind. Anticipating success in China, he\\'s cut a licensing deal with a grower on the mainland, a move he hopes will deter intellectual-property thieves.\\n\\nThe stakes are high. With the cost of planting orchards as much as $60,000 an acre, \"people are taking huge risks to try and get into a fruit that they hope will get them an adequate return,\" Brandt says.\\n\\nMany growers say they have no choice: Labor and other costs have been rising steadily for apple farms, even as consumers have slowly soured on industry stalwarts such as Red Delicious and Galas, which together made up about half of Washington\\'s crop of 120 million boxes last year, according to the Washington Apple Commission. The U.S. domestic market for Washington apples has been static for years, at about 90 million boxes. That puts a premium on developing new export markets and selling higher-margin varieties at home. Honeycrisps fetch as much as $70 a box, more than three times the price of Red Delicious.\\n\\nBut in apple orchards this spring, it\\'s easy to find signs that the trade wars are delaying the transition of an industry that\\'s been dominated by family-owned operations and is only starting to open up to outside capital. \"You are not seeing the sort of investment in orchards or planting equipment that you would normally see,\" says Powers, head of the Northwest Horticultural Council.\\n\\nNature may still wield more power to disrupt farmers\\' lives than tariffs. The Iowa Farm Bureau has estimated that losses from recent flooding along the Missouri River, as well as potential flooding from local rainfall and snowmelt in states to the north, could cause more than $2 billion in damage in the state.\\n\\nAt Andy Jobman\\'s farm in central Nebraska, the Platte River, a tributary of the Missouri, overflowed its banks last month, leaving some fields under as much as 8 feet of water. When the floodwaters receded, they left behind muddy debris that needed to be carted away and a host of delayed tasks -- from applying fertilizer to tilling -- to prepare the fields for new crops.\\n\\nJobman, who farms 1,200 acres of soybeans and corn with his father and brother, can\\'t escape the persistent uncertainty caused by the trade wars. Because of the collapse in demand for soybeans last year, his family stored some of the harvest. Aid payments doled out by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have helped plug the revenue hole, but most financial decision-making has \"slowed down,\" he says, because it\\'s hard to get a bead on where prices are headed.\\n\\nOne open question is whether business will revert to normal if tariffs are lifted. History has shown that even a short interruption in the supply of a commodity can have long-term consequences for American farmers. A U.S. trade spat with Japan in the 1980s that lasted only days helped trigger an increase of investment in Brazil\\'s soybean sector, now the biggest U.S. competitor for that crop. China\\'s punitive tariffs on U.S. soybean imports have prompted pig farmers on the mainland to find alternative sources of feed, says Veronica Nigh, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation. It\\'s not clear whether they\\'ll ever resume purchases on the same scale, even if Beijing commits to buying more U.S. soybeans as part of a trade deal.\\n\\nDaniel Kowalski, a vice president of agricultural lender CoBank ACB, worries that one of the most enduring effects of the trade war may be the expansion in crop production from South America to the Black Sea \"to fill space we vacated.\" The reality is that, under Trump, the U.S. has so far been losing more access to lucrative agricultural export markets than it\\'s been gaining. The president\\'s withdrawal from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership immediately after he took office left U.S. beef and pork producers at a disadvantage in Japan, as well as in fast-growing economies such as Vietnam, vs. competitors in Australia and New Zealand, which remain in the TPP. European Union farmers are also benefiting from a trade pact with Japan that went into effect on Feb. 1.\\n\\nThe fight with China has hurt American soybean growers and other agricultural exporters. But so have Canada\\'s and Mexico\\'s retaliation against Trump\\'s steel tariffs. That\\'s the big reason Chuck Grassley, the powerful Iowa Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, has said duties on Canadian and Mexican steel will have to be lifted before Congress ratifies the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump\\'s replacement for Nafta.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the productivity of America\\'s farm and livestock sectors keeps climbing, generating even greater food surpluses that will continue to depress prices if buyers can\\'t be found overseas. \"Keeping farmers and agribusinesses healthy becomes more challenging if we can\\'t grow the export markets like we have in the past,\" CoBank\\'s Kowalski says.\\n\\nIn Ville Platte, La., Richard Fontenot tills land his family has tended for five generations. The souring of the export relationship with China last year cost him $300,000 in the form of 1,000 acres of soybeans he was forced to leave in the field to rot because the grain bins on his property were already full, as were the export-driven elevators he sells to. Insurance covered some of the losses, but when he tried to tap into the aid the Trump administration made available for farmers hurt by the trade wars, he was told he wasn\\'t eligible because he hadn\\'t harvested the crop. So there\\'s been belt-tightening. Instead of shelling out $300,000 for a used combine as planned, Fontenot spent $30,000 to rehab his existing machine. \"I had a crop in the field that I couldn\\'t export because of the tariffs,\" he says.\\n\\nFontenot, who like many farmers in what\\'s known as the Cajun Prairie raises rice and crawfish alongside his soybeans, is keeping a wary eye on a near-record stockpile of soybeans nationally and on the Mississippi\\'s high waters. He remains a Trump supporter, as are most voters in Evangeline Parish, where the president won almost 70 percent of the vote in 2016. His hope is that the losses he\\'s taken on soybeans will be salved by future rice sales to China. \"He\\'s costing me money today, but I think he\\'s going to make me money in the future,\" Fontenot says.\\n\\nTrump\\'s tariffs -- and the effect they\\'re having on investment -- are hurting business at Hog Slat, the 50-year-old family business David Herring runs with his brother in the North Carolina hamlet of Newton Grove, where their grandfather\\'s hardware store once stood. Hog Slat makes everything it takes to build the vast sheds that house pigs, from the slotted floors that gave the business its name to feed bins and ventilation systems. It also assembles the sheds. Over the past year, its business has slowed.\\n\\nThere have been other blows, too. Steel tariffs raised the price of the domestic metal the company uses. Herring\\'s own hog business was hit by the retaliatory duties imposed by Mexico, the biggest export market for U.S. pork by volume, and the resulting collapse in prices. Hog Slat is a private company, and Herring, who earlier this year assumed the rotating presidency of the National Pork Producers Council, won\\'t disclose its financials, saying only that \"there was a lot of money lost\" and he had to lay off 80 of his 1,500 employees in the U.S.\\n\\nIn a community where conservatism is the rule, farmers remain optimistic that the president they voted for in 2016 will live up to his pledge to make it up to farmers, Herring says. It helps that they\\'ve benefited from Trump\\'s deregulatory agenda, including laxer federal rules for water use, as well as cuts to business and estate taxes. But \"patience is not where it was six months ago,\" he says. And that forbearance may not survive another year like the last.\\n\\nFor Lorenda Overman, 2018 was the worst year she\\'s seen in the 37 since she married a farmer and moved onto the patch of North Carolina that her husband\\'s family has owned and nurtured since before the Revolutionary War. There was the economic storm that came in the form of the trade wars, and then there was Hurricane Florence, which turned harvest time into a scramble to salvage crops. For the first time, the Overmans had to delay writing the monthly checks that support the families of two of their grown children, who live and work alongside them on the farm. \"You are taking the food right out of the mouths of your grandchildren,\" she says.\\n\\nNow she\\'s worried about numbers that don\\'t pencil out even before some crops have been planted. At current prices, this year\\'s corn, wheat, and soybeans are set to yield almost $290,000 in losses, by her calculations. And that\\'s if nothing else goes wrong. But she hasn\\'t lost hope in Trump. If the man whom she voted for and cheered from the sixth row at the Farm Bureau convention cuts a deal with China, she hopes markets will respond. \"A swipe of the pen, and those prices can bounce back,\" she says.\\n\\nSome of the changes brought on by Trump\\'s trade offensive may linger, though. The 7,500 hogs that spend 18 weeks at a time housed in six sheds on the Overmans\\' farm in Goldsboro are owned by what\\'s known in the industry as an \"integrator.\" To fatten them up from 10-week-old piglets into 250-pound to 300-pound beasts, the family is paid a set rate that hasn\\'t changed in a decade. But in part because of trade war losses, the integrator will be phasing out its multiyear contracts and replacing them with 120-day ones, a switch that will leave the family more exposed to the vagaries of the markets.

On top of the 2x points earned on all dining and travel purchases, the card also comes with class-leading benefits, including primary collision damage waiver/theft insurance for rental cars, trip delay and baggage delay coverage, robust purchase protections, and fantastic customer service.\\n\\nOn top of all that, Chase offers Sapphire Preferred cardholders great options for redeeming points; you can exchange them for cash back at one cent per point, or you can use them to purchase travel thorough Chase\\'s booking portal with a 25% bonus. Best of all, you can can transfer points to Chase\\'s frequent flyer partners (click here to read about why that\\'s potentially the most lucrative way to use your points).\\n\\nFor a while, holding the Sapphire Preferred was a no-brainer.\\n\\nThen, in 2016, Chase launched a souped-up version of the card: the Chase Sapphire Reserve. In addition to offering the same benefits as its predecessor, the Sapphire Reserve packs on a few extra features for serious travelers. It earns 3x points on travel and dining instead of 2x, and comes with a $300 annual travel credit, access to select airport lounges through the Priority Pass network, a trip delay insurance policy that takes effect after shorter delays, and elite benefits with a few car rental agencies.\\n\\nWith the Sapphire Reserve, you can also redeem points the same way as with the Preferred -- with one difference. When using them to purchase travel through Chase, you\\'ll get a 50% bonus, instead of just 25%.\\n\\nAlong with the added perks, though, the beefier card comes with a higher annual fee. While the Sapphire Preferred only costs $95 per year, the Sapphire Reserve has an un-waived annual fee of $450. When you subtract the $300 travel credit, which is essentially applied to the first $300 of travel-category spending each cardmember year, the effective fee is only $150 per year, a $55 increase over the Preferred.\\n\\nSo what makes the Sapphire Reserve worth the higher annual fee? Which one is right for you? Here are a few questions to ask yourself when deciding between the two cards.\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the Chase Sapphire Preferred card from Insider Picks\\' partner The Points Guy.\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the Chase Sapphire Reserve from Insider Picks\\' partner The Points Guy.\\n\\nTo start, let\\'s keep it simple and focus solely on the points earning.\\n\\nWithout considering any other perks or benefits, the deciding factor between the two cards should be whether you spend enough on dining and travel that earning an extra point per dollar is worth the Sapphire Reserve\\'s higher annual fee.\\n\\nThe Sapphire Preferred\\'s fee is $95, while the Sapphire Reserve\\'s fee is $450. However, if you factor in the $300 travel credit that the Sapphire Reserve includes each year -- which is good on everything from taxis, parking, tolls, and subway fares to flights, cruises, and hotels -- the card\\'s fee is effectively only $150. The difference between the Preferred\\'s fee ($95) and the Reserve\\'s (effectively $150) is $55.\\n\\nFor argument\\'s sake, let\\'s assume you value your points at 1.5 cent each (that\\'s the value of points used to purchase travel through Chase, with the 50% bonus if you hold the Sapphire Reserve). That means you would need to earn 3,660 points each year to make up the $55 annual fee difference between the two cards.\\n\\nSo if you spend at least $3,660 on dining and travel each year, the extra point earned per dollar will add up to the difference in fees and make it worth getting the Sapphire Reserve card. That\\'s without factoring in the other benefits of the card.\\n\\nOf course, this will still require you to pay the $450 annual fee every 12 months. Even though you\\'ll get the travel credit applied to the first $300 of relevant spending each cardmember year, that can be a lot of money to pay up front. Whether you want to front $450 is entirely a personal decision, make sure you weigh the cash outlay (and the fact that the fee isn\\'t waived the first year) against the higher earning potential. Moving on from points earning.\\n\\nA lot of discussion around the Sapphire Reserve focuses on the points and more obvious perks, like lounge access, but personally, I think the trip delay insurance is one of the most valuable features. I live in New York, where delays are fairly frequent, whether because of mechanical issues, intense weather, or other problems.\\n\\nThat\\'s why I like the extra layer of security added by the Sapphire Reserve. The card\\'s trip delay coverage becomes effective after just six hours, or if you end up stuck overnight. The Sapphire Preferred\\'s coverage is also activated when there\\'s an overnight delay; if the delay is entirely during the day, the coverage takes effect after 12 hours.\\n\\nIf the trip delay insurance activating sooner is worth the higher annual fee, then you should consider the Sapphire Reserve. After a seven-hour delay this summer, I was able to submit a claim for a number of expenses including lunch, a phone backup battery, and even a pair of headphones I needed. However, any stay that incurs major expenses, like a hotel room and a change of clothes, would probably involve an overnight stay and therefore be covered by the Sapphire Preferred\\'s insurance.\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the Chase Sapphire Preferred card from Insider Picks\\' partner The Points Guy.\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the Chase Sapphire Reserve from Insider Picks\\' partner The Points Guy.\\n\\nAirport lounges are the best. Even when they\\'re relatively lively (read: crowded), it\\'s much better than the main terminal and gate areas. I love having a place to sit down, relax, charge my phone, and have a few drinks or a snack while I wait for my flight; or, other times, to hunker down with my laptop and take advantage of the lounge wi-fi to do some work. Sometimes, airport lounges can be downright luxurious and include amenities like complimentary spa treatments.\\n\\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve includes a free Priority Pass Select membership for as long as you have the card. Priority Pass is a network of more than 1,000 airport lounges around the world. A Select membership grants access to member lounges for you and any travel companions. While amenities vary by lounge, most of them tend to offer private wi-fi, free hard and soft drinks, snacks, and comfortable seating. Some lounges also feature heartier food options, sometimes included or sometimes for an additional charge.\\n\\nYou can take a look at Priority Pass\\'s full network of lounges by clicking \"Find a Lounge\" on the upper-left corner of this page to gauge whether the membership will be useful for you. The network is more robust abroad; the amount of US locations is relatively limited, and they tend to be found in international terminals, so you may not always be able to access lounges before domestic trips.\\n\\nSeveral airports also have restaurants which are part of the Priority Pass network. At these restaurants -- including the Grain Store at London\\'s Gatwick airport -- you\\'ll get a certain amount credited on the bill for you and each guest. At the Grain Store, each guest is entitled to a £15 credit.\\n\\nIf your home airport has a Priority Pass lounge in a terminal you can generally access, or you travel internationally even once or twice a year, then the Priority Pass membership can be great to have, especially if you ever find yourself bored and waiting out a delay. If you don\\'t think you\\'ll have much use for the Priority Pass membership, you might prefer the Sapphire Preferred and its lower annual fee.\\n\\nFirst thing\\'s first; if you don\\'t have Global Entry and TSA PreCheck, you should really get it. With PreCheck, you can use special security lines at most US airports. In those lanes, you can keep your shoes, belt, and light jackets on, leave your laptop in your bag, and only go through a metal detector instead of a full body scanner. The process is much quicker than regular security, and it\\'s much less uncomfortable.\\n\\nWith Global Entry, you can skip the immigration line when returning from the US and scan your passport at an unmanned kiosk instead. It prints a receipt which you bring to the customs stop after baggage claim, and just like that: you\\'re good to go. Immigration at a busy terminal can take hours; with Global Entry, I\\'ve gotten through at JFK in four minutes.\\n\\nYou can apply to either program, but Global Entry usually includes TSA PreCheck and the $100 application fee is only a bit more than the $85 you\\'d pay to just apply for PreCheck. Plus, the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a credit for either program. If you aren\\'t enrolled in one of these programs yet, you may want to consider the Reserve. Otherwise, the Sapphire Preferred might be your best bet, unless you\\'re due to renew your membership soon.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to add authorized users, like a spouse or child, keep in mind that the Sapphire Reserve charges an annual fee of $75 to add anyone to your account, Each authorized user gets their own Priority Pass Select membership, at least. There\\'s no fee to add an authorized user to your Sapphire Preferred account.\\n\\nUltimately, the two biggest things to consider when deciding between the cards is whether or not you\\'re willing to pay the higher annual fee for the Sapphire Reserve, and whether you spend enough on dining and travel to make it worth that higher fee. Beyond that, take a look at the difference in perks and see which is best for you.', 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'david_slotnick@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'David Slotnick', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b57a01aa89a1d20008b467f-1536-768.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4671039', 'sentiment': 0.3568627450980393, 'wgt': 1057}\n",

The softness in the category came despite promises by Trump and Republican leaders that tax breaks for equipment purchases in the party\\'s signature tax law would boost investment by farmers and manufacturers.\\n\\nThe reluctance of farmers and other business owners to invest in equipment flashed a cautionary signal in a report on the U.S. economy that overall surprised forecasters with stronger-than-expected results. The Commerce Department reported Friday that U.S. growth accelerated to an annualized 3.2 percent rate in the first quarter.\\n\\nThe fresh signs of financial pressure on farmers, local tractor dealers and the other suppliers that support them underscore the rising political danger the trade war presents to Trump as a negotiating team heads to Beijing next week for another round of trade talks.

That section of federal law relates to assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain government agents.\\n\\nGal\\'s detention and alleged threats by the CBP agents, resulted in a civil rights complaint filed on March 28 by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU) of Northern California against the United States. The complaint alleges that the search of Gal\\'s possessions violated the Fourth and First Amendments, which protects U.S. citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures and protects free speech.\\n\\nIn the 10 years prior to becoming a citizen, Gal said he made about 100 international trips, all without incident.\\n\\n\"They told me at the border, even as a U.S. citizen, I don\\'t have any rights to an attorney,\" Gal, who became a U.S. citizen three years ago, said. \"I told them I wanted to speak to an attorney. Then they said they would keep my devices and I said I don\\'t consent to it but I would comply.\"\\n\\n\"I think by me resisting their unlawful demands, I think at some point they saw there\\'s nothing further they can do or say to change my mind and then they decided to let me go,\" he said. He said in the end he was able to keep his devices and never unlocked them for the agents or handed over his passwords.\\n\\nAs Gal was leaving, the CBP agents confiscated his Global Entry card and revoked his status. Global Entry is a program administered by CBP which allows pre-screened, low-risk international travelers to skip security lines upon arrival in the U.S.\\n\\nOn his next return from Europe, Gal noticed the code \"SSSS\" on his boarding pass, indicating a secondary security screening. Prior to the November incident, Gal was never subject to a secondary screening in any of his border crossings back into the U.S., he said.\\n\\nA spokesperson from CBP told ABC News in an email that they could not comment on Gal\\'s situation as it is \"currently under investigation.\"\\n\\n\"However, in general, all travelers arriving to the U.S. are subject to CBP inspection. This inspection may include electronic devices such as computers, disks, drives, tapes, mobile phones and other communication devices, cameras, music and other media players and any other electronic or digital devices,\" the spokesperson wrote, in part.\\n\\nThe CBP spokesperson also said that travelers who do not provide the items requested by their agents \"may result in the detention and/or seizure of the electronic device.\"\\n\\nBetween 2016 and 2017, CBP had a 59% jump in the number of searches of electronic devices, according to the agency\\'s data.\\n\\n\"Approximately 0.007 percent of arriving international travelers processed by CBP officers (more than 397 million) had their electronic devices searched (more than 29,200).

I\\'m a boring, middle-aged white male software executive. I\\'m very average. It\\'s not something I would have expected to experience, to get yelled at by three armed men just because I return home,\" Gal said.\\n\\nGal charged that his stop by CBP agents may be because of his work at Mozilla and the company\\'s views on opposing the government\\'s warrantless mass surveillance.\\n\\n(MORE: US Customs and Border Protection detain 9-year-old US citizen for 32 hours without her parents at border)\\n\\n\"In the past two years I\\'ve been very outspoken on the Trump administration\\'s policies on social media, particularly with respect to Customs and Border Protection and immigration,\" said Gal.\\n\\nThe ACLU complaint states that such searches may unlawfully curb the behavior of citizens like Gal.\\n\\nThere\\'s no such thing as a cursory inspection of the contents of your cell phone...This is essentially my entire life for the last 10 to 15 years I\\'m carrying with me on my cell phone.

He had joined Barilla SpA as chief executive officer less than a year before and was on his way to a dinner with its chairman, Guido Barilla, who was giving a live interview on national station Radio 24. As the sun edged lower in his rearview mirror, Colzani turned up the volume and listened as his boss walked the hosts through the company\\'s family heritage -- its spaghettis and sauces. Then Barilla dropped a bombshell he would spend half a decade atoning for.\\n\\n\"I would never do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect, but because we don\\'t agree with them,\" Barilla said on Italy\\'s best-known radio talk show. If gay customers didn\\'t like that, they could go buy another brand of pasta, he said. Barilla, who together with his three siblings owns 85 percent of the company\\'s shares and holds an individual stake worth about $1.1 billion, extolled the values of the \"classic family\" that the brand targeted. The chairman, who turned 60 last year and has five children, further clarified that he opposed adoption by gay parents.\\n\\nColzani was stunned. He immediately called Luca Virginio, the company\\'s head of communications, shouting into the phone, \"What the hell is going on?\" It would take another half-hour to arrive at Parma\\'s Ristorante Cocchi and confront his boss about the magnitude of his mistake. In that time, and in the weeks that followed, social media ignited with outrage as people accused Barilla of homophobia. Amid calls for a global boycott, Colzani\\'s family and friends asked what he was doing running that sort of business, and members of his leadership team said they felt deeply uncomfortable. Harvard pulled the pasta from its dining halls, and major retailers in the U.S. and Europe asked to meet with Colzani to clarify the company\\'s stance. The list of celebrities pledging to shun the brand included Jodi Picoult and Chrissy Teigen, who suggested in a tweet to her 11 million followers that she would fund gay pornography filmed in a bathtub filled with linguine.\\n\\n\"I was concerned about the market share, but I was much more worried about people perceiving Barilla as an out-of-date brand,\" Colzani said in a February interview at Barilla\\'s headquarters, a steel-and-glass low-rise next to a sprawling factory that produces almost 1,000 tons of pasta per day. (Through a spokesman, Guido Barilla and his siblings declined to be interviewed.) The finance team alerted Colzani to a marginal dip in the company\\'s sales, but the commercial impact was microscopic. In the consumer-goods industry, short-term losses can usually be recovered through small price adjustments. At $3.2 billion (excluding currency fluctuations), Barilla\\'s revenue was ultimately higher in 2013, the year its chairman made the comments, than in 2012, and higher still in 2014.\\n\\nBecause the bigger preoccupation for consumer brands tends to be cachet -- an abstraction valued in the tens of billions of dollars on their balance sheets as \"intangible assets\" -- irrelevance can have worse financial consequences than brief buffers in a company\\'s revenue streams. In February, Kraft Heinz Co. admitted its products were failing to connect with diners who increasingly turned their back on industrialized food when it wrote $15.4 billion -- more than half the group\\'s annual sales -- off the value of Oscar Mayer hot dogs and Velveeta processed cheese.\\n\\nFor decades, Barilla was unshakable. As the flag-bearer for mass-market pasta, the company not only survived Atkins and other low-carb diets but thrived on an image of authenticity. In the U.S., dry pasta brands are generally interchangeable, only further anonymized when doused in marinara. But Barilla\\'s serial promotion of its ties to Italian home cooking in television ads set to an Andrea Bocelli song earned it a quarter of the U.S. pasta market. Colzani now watched that carefully curated image unravel in real time. He measured the brand\\'s declining appeal with customers on a monthly basis using tools developed by Millward Brown, a market-research company owned by advertising conglomerate WPP Plc. In 2014, Barilla dropped 21 spots on the Reputation Institute\\'s annual ranking of companies.\\n\\nBefore Barilla, Colzani had enjoyed a 25-year career at Unilever, most recently in New Jersey, where he was chief customer officer and sat on the diversity committee. He first registered an interest in joining Barilla after hearing its chairman speak at a consumer-products forum in Barcelona in 2011 about the company\\'s commitment to fighting obesity through better nutrition. But the 2013 incident served as a stark reminder that, in Italy, \"the debate on LGBT issues came very, very late compared to many other European countries,\" Colzani said. He attributed the lag to the overwhelming influence of religion on moral philosophy in a country where about 70 percent of citizens identify as Catholic.\\n\\nColzani called former colleagues for counsel and appointed a chief diversity and inclusion officer. He leaned on workplace consultants Korn Ferry for advice and formed an external advisory board. U.S. public-relations company Edelman was drafted to steer communications. Colzani started spending about $5 million a year devising an ambitious reputational turnaround. For the past five years the company has earned the highest possible score on the Human Rights Campaign\\'s corporate equality index. Barilla transformed from a pasta giant that would never feature homosexuals in its campaigns into one that sells spaghetti in homoerotic packaging.\\n\\nBarilla was founded by Pietro Barilla in 1877 as a small bakery on a merchant road in downtown Parma, a city with pillared churches and bustling piazzas at almost every turn. It has a storied association with the country\\'s finest food -- its namesake province is home to the acclaimed Culatello cut of cured ham and to Parmigiano cheese, often imitated outside the region as \"Parmesan.\"\\n\\nToday, Barilla is a superpower. It owns about a dozen food brands, including high-end Voiello pasta and Wasabrod, the world\\'s largest producer of Scandinavian crispbread, and last year sold about $4 billion worth of products in more than 100 countries. For much of its early history, Barilla had incomparable clout in Italy\\'s pantries, boasting in commercials that its products were the backbone ingredients in the majority of pasta dishes plated in family homes across the nation. Today it accounts for a little less than half of Italy\\'s pasta, with its nearest rival, De Cecco, making up a distant 10 percent. Twenty years ago, Barilla generated almost all of its revenue at home, but now, Italy accounts for about a third of its sales. That number is expected to drop as Barilla seeks growth from developing markets such as Russia and Turkey, Colzani said. He\\'s also bullish on new noodles aimed at the post-yoga crowd: vegan and gluten-free penne made from red lentils.\\n\\nThe business has fallen out of family control only once, for about a decade, when it was reluctantly sold to U.S. chemical conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co. In the early 1970s the construction of Barilla\\'s new factory on the outskirts of Parma took an enormous financial toll, and Italy\\'s government set price controls on the majority of the company\\'s products. Since reacquiring Barilla in 1979, the family has advocated for the sort of costly long-term initiatives that tend to fare better at private companies than publicly listed ones.\\n\\nColzani said that during his six years at the helm, he\\'s never had a conversation with the Barillas about boosting profit. Instead, discussions have revolved around environmental efforts, such as hiking the company\\'s costs by about €40 million ($45 million) a year to rid its supply chain of palm oil, which it did in 2017. Barilla is also working with the farmers who supply the durum wheat for its pasta to end their use of glyphosate-based herbicides, which the World Health Organization classifies as probably carcinogenic to humans.\\n\\nThis sort of progressive work only fuels the romanticism Barilla enjoys as one of Italy\\'s largest family-owned businesses. This same dynamic has been championed by the families behind chocolatier Ferrero SpA\\'s generous funding of literature and science programs, distiller Davide Campari-Milano SpA\\'s partnership with the contemporary art fair in Turin, and coffee giant Luigi Lavazza SpA\\'s mission to improve livelihoods in the countries from which it sources its beans. \"I think most of the owners perceive the company as an extension of their families, and one positive is that it triggers a sense of belonging for employees,\" Massimo Magni, who lectures on organizational behavior at Bocconi University\\'s school of management, said of the nation\\'s corporate kindred. \"But a pitfall is that the family will often take more of a paternalistic approach than a management approach.\"\\n\\nThat sense is even stronger at a company such as Barilla, which brands its namesake product as a cornerstone of national identity. The alignment of its advertising with the Italian idyll of a nuclear, traditional family gathered around a home-cooked lasagna reflected a lifestyle the vast majority of the country\\'s citizens are proud to lead. Italy still has one of the worst records for gay rights in Western Europe, according to a regional arm of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. Last year the country placed in the lower half on the advocacy group\\'s annual ranking of European nations, based on marriage equality, reports of hate crimes, and other metrics.\\n\\nBarilla is not the only Italian pasta maker to come under fire for homophobia. In February, Italy\\'s Supreme Court ruled that Gian Luca Rana, the CEO of Verona\\'s family-owned Pastificio Rana SpA, had caused \"concrete and serious prejudice to the dignity\" of a manager he\\'d repeatedly addressed as finocchio, the Italian word for \"fennel,\" which is also a homophobic slur. Rana defended his use of the word as innocuous in the context of collegial workplace banter. Even though Guido Barilla immediately apologized for the comments he made on the Radio 24 talk show, he drew ire for sounding phlegmatic -- he referred to having offended \"the sensitivities of some people.\"\\n\\nSome attitudes are less equivocal. In the first parliamentary session that followed the chairman\\'s interview, Gianluca Buonanno, a politician in the right-wing Lega party, provoked two openly gay colleagues with a fennel bulb and attempted to physically assault one of them. The following month, in an unconnected event, a 21-year-old gay medical student who had been a victim of bullying dialed 10 suicide hotlines before jumping to his death from the 11th floor of a former pasta factory in Rome. \"Italy is a free country but there is homophobia,\" a note found after his death reportedly read. \"Those who have these attitudes must deal with their conscience.\" It was the third suicide by a young gay man in Rome that year.\\n\\nDuring this same period of time, workers at Barilla -- which employs about 8,500 globally at more than 50 factories and offices -- expressed shock and dismay. The chairman\\'s comments struck some as especially provincial, given his otherwise international outlook. \"I know Guido very well, and he told us many times in small groups that he made a mistake and apologized for embarrassing us as employees, because he\\'s not like that, and the company isn\\'t like that,\" said Alessandro Spadini, who\\'s worked for the pasta maker for almost three decades and runs the Pedrignano plant adjacent to its headquarters.\\n\\nThe fourth Barilla in as many generations to lead the company, Guido Barilla joined the business in 1986 and drove much of its expansion abroad before taking over the chairmanship from his father, who died in 1993. After studying philosophy in Italy, he\\'d started his career at several food companies in the U.S., a country to which he\\'d retained a sentimental connection after competing as a track-and-field athlete at Boston College. He keeps an apartment in Manhattan, and two of his sons are enrolled at his alma mater in Massachusetts, where they\\'re members of the soccer and tennis teams.\\n\\nOutside of a board directorship at French yogurt giant Danone SA, Barilla lives and breathes the family\\'s pasta empire. He dresses the part of the modern industrialist, matching understated ties to dark suits cut to his tall, slim frame. Before his on-air misstep, his only public eccentricity had been the styling of his gray hair, which oscillates between a military trim and an unkempt musketeer\\'s mop. He eats Barilla pasta daily and prefers it unadulterated, renouncing sauce in favor of light Parmigiano shavings and a shallow spoonful of olive oil.\\n\\nThe most remarkable thing about the chairman\\'s interview was just how unremarkable it was in the context of the hostile rhetoric of Italy\\'s most powerful businessmen. In 2015, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, the billionaire founders of the eponymous Milan-based fashion house, proclaimed in an interview with Panorama magazine that \"the only family is the traditional one\" and that children conceived with the help of in vitro fertilization were the \"synthetic\" sum of \"semen from a catalogue\" and a \"rented uterus.\" Despite being a couple for 23 years before a split in 2005, they also spoke out against same-sex marriage. Their views were condemned by leading voices: Elton John called for a boycott, and Victoria Beckham expressed her love and support for his family, which was conceived through IVF. In recent months, haute couture powerhouses Gucci SpA and Prada SpA have introduced and subsequently withdrawn an $890 turtleneck sweater deplored for resembling blackface imagery and a $550 monkey figurine reminiscent of anti-black caricatures. Although the companies have denied any subliminal messaging, the designs come as Italy\\'s xenophobic discourse soars under its right-wing government, which views immigration as a threat to national identity.\\n\\nAt Barilla, Colzani is determined that the company resist the backward direction of the country, which entered recession for the third time in a decade in January and has seen the annual number of racial and homophobic attacks steadily rise. He\\'s adamant that instead of priding itself on reflecting the country\\'s culture, Barilla should lead it by projecting a better ideal. After the radio interview, Colzani plotted three chapters: apology, investigation, and promotion. \"We were simply trying to be a good citizen. Now, we\\'re trying to be a role model.\"\\n\\nThe strategy to right-size Barilla\\'s image falls in line with a wider attempt the business has taken to appeal to more-discerning shoppers. Over the past decade, with carbohydrates under siege from fashionable ketogenic and paleo diets, the company has directly funded or is tied to more than 10 peer-reviewed studies that have touted pasta\\'s nutritional benefits. The Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition has co-hosted breakfasts at the World Economic Forum in Davos promoting sustainability initiatives.\\n\\nThe radio interview effectively rescinded Barilla\\'s seat at the table with progressives, whom it needed to ensure the long-term viability of the brand. \"I would guarantee that there would have been virtually no drop-off in sales, because capability -- Does the pasta taste good? Is the distribution effective? -- means more to the customer than character, which has more saliency with employees, retailers, and community partners,\" said Rupert Younger, who leads the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation and is a co-founder of communications company Finsbury. Instead, a typical betterment catalyst in cases such as Barilla\\'s is the landslide of staff -- including senior managers -- voicing their anger at the discriminatory statements, he said.\\n\\nThe week after his comments, Guido agreed to meet with Parks Liberi e Uguali, a nonprofit that works with employers on LGBT inclusion, and the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on ending bullying and online harassment. Colzani implemented diversity and inclusion training and unconscious bias courses for the entire workforce. Now employees are asked every 18 months whether they feel their leaders are committed to building more-diverse teams. (In the latest assessment, 72 percent of participants said yes, up from 65 percent in the previous one.) Almost 1,000 workers have formed and joined employee resource groups, each focused on a specific theme, such as refugee training or gender and sexual identity. Beatrice Burlenghi and Martina Olivola, the leaders of the latter group, nicknamed Voce, distributed Barilla-branded rainbow bracelets to employees after meeting with a similar group at General Electric Co. that had done the same.\\n\\nAll the company\\'s efforts are supervised by Kristen Anderson, the chief diversity and inclusion officer and a former chemical engineer on Barilla\\'s research and development team. She also heads an internal committee of about a dozen employees that meets every two months to gauge progress on initiatives such as co-creating packaging with disabled customers and promoting women to leadership positions. Colzani\\'s request for a separate board of external advisers was tougher to deliver on, because most of the potential candidates Barilla approached didn\\'t want to be affiliated with the company, Anderson said. David Mixner, a civil rights activist, author, and playwright once named by Newsweek magazine as the most powerful gay man in America, refused four times to meet with Guido Barilla before finally agreeing to it as a personal favor to a friend who worked in public relations.\\n\\n\"I joined the boycott and said I wouldn\\'t meet with him, because I\\'m so sick of going to these things and hearing nothing but apologies,\" Mixner said. He finally relented and met the chairman for lunch at the Glass House Tavern near Times Square. Before sitting down at the restaurant, which has a crispy chicken salad named after him, Mixner instructed the waiters to speed up the service so he could leave within the hour. He and Barilla ended up spending four hours at the table, during which the 72-year-old Mixner spoke of the pain he\\'d suffered for being gay. He\\'d spent three years estranged from his family, lost jobs, and been the target of a hate crime. Barilla said his family had a long history of combating injustice, with his father having been involved with members of the resistance against Italy\\'s fascist regime in the 1940s.\\n\\nThe company now pays Mixner an annual stipend of $25,000 to serve on the advisory board. It has also sponsored some of his plays, the proceeds of which have gone to the Ali Forney Center, an organization based in New York that helps homeless gay youths find shelter, and efforts to advance marriage equality in Italy. Since his lunch with Barilla, Mixner has become the chairman\\'s most trusted confidant on diversity issues. \"I got a lot of grief from the LGBT community when I agreed to help him out,\" Mixner said. \"But I told them that the purpose of a movement is to change minds.\"\\n\\nAt the company\\'s annual staff meeting in December, Barilla showed a short film in which an American employee narrated, \"Five years have passed since the beginning of our journey.\" Pictures of Mixner and the company\\'s chairman hugging flashed on the screen to a solemn piano solo as the narrator said that Barilla had come to learn that love is blind, because it makes no distinctions of gender, religion, or race.\\n\\nTwo months earlier, at the Pasta World Championship in Milan, Barilla did exactly what its chairman had promised would never happen: It unveiled a limited edition of its most popular product, Spaghetti No.\\u20095, wrapped in a box illustrated with two women holding hands, a single strand of pasta held between their lips in a nod to Walt Disney Co.\\'s Lady and the Tramp. It was designed by Olimpia Zagnoli, an Italian artist who had advocated for boycotting Barilla in 2013.\\n\\nThere\\'s still a way to go. When Burlenghi, the Voce team leader, participated in the most recent Pride march in Milan wearing a Barilla T-shirt, she was asked by fellow attendees if the company had paid her to walk on its behalf. Barilla hasn\\'t received many compliments for its efforts from its former critics, Colzani said. \"They say, \\'You\\'re OK. You\\'re still in repair mode.\\' Which I think is a fair comment. We\\'ll always try to improve ourselves before telling others we\\'re fine.\"\\n\\nBarilla still leans on its heritage, though. In the middle of the lobby at the company\\'s headquarters, a screen updates about every 10 seconds with thousands of Instagram posts pooled from every continent that promote the Mediterranean diet or dishes made with Barilla\\'s products. Opposite, a floor-to-ceiling painting hangs on the wall, based on a black-and-white photograph of the pasta maker\\'s first shop in Parma. The canvas is brightened by a loud diagonal dash of yellow that reads, \"Di che pasta sei fatto?\" a colloquialism in Italian that means \"What are you made of?\"', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'thomas_buckley@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Thomas Buckley', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i0NqthmwxDkg/v0/1200x630.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 1028}\n",

The sales office was \"mayhem\" as buyers and agents begged for units in that pricing sweet spot. That same week, Papailias went to another presale condo launch by CentreCourt Inc. and SmartREIT, which sold out in three days. He had to weave through almost 3,000 agents competing for 490 units.\\n\\n\"The minute anything launches -- C$800 per square foot -- and connects to Toronto by subway, there is a complete frenzy,\" he said.\\n\\nSingle-family homes are a different story.

It\\'s what is expected to prevail in normal economic times, and is affected by a mix of global and domestic factors.\\n\\nBecause of significant uncertainty surrounding this variable, which cannot be directly observed, the Ottawa-based central bank presents it as a range of 2.25 to 3.25 percent. The midpoint of the range was revised down 25 basis points on Wednesday from its previous estimate, and more than two percentage points below its assessment from the mid-2000s.\\n\\nThis downward revision may come as a sigh of relief for debt-laden Canadian households, which are currently seeing the growth of debt payments outstrip the increase in income by the most since the financial crisis, thanks in part to the Bank of Canada\\'s five interest rate hikes since mid-2017.\\n\\nIt\\'s an acknowledgement that forces weighing on global growth are more structural in nature -- and as a result the Canadian economy has less need for higher rates.\\n\\nWednesday\\'s change also remedies an odd disconnect in which the Bank of Canada\\'s estimate of the neutral rate was higher than the Federal Reserve\\'s, despite a long history of subpar productivity growth and the Canadian mortgage market\\'s greater sensitivity to policy changes.\\n\\nThe approach taken by the Bank of Canada is simply to take the median estimate of the neutral rate from the Fed, considered the world\\'s central bank, and tack a 50-basis point range on either side.\\n\\nStaff research at the Bank of Canada, released Wednesday, suggest that using alternative methods that are more Canada- centric may generate an even lower neutral rate.\\n\\nAn area for future study would involve how to incorporate the onerous burden faced by Canadian households into the Bank of Canada\\'s assessment of the neutral rate.\\n\\nFinancial markets, for their part, never bought into the idea that the Bank\\'s policy rate would ascend to 3 percent over foreseeable projection horizons.\\n\\nCanada\\'s economy isn\\'t able to sustainably grow as fast as once hoped -- something the Bank of Canada acknowledged again on Wednesday by revising down its estimates for potential output.\\n\\nThe two concepts -- neutral and potential -- are inextricably intertwined. In an April 2016 speech, Bank of Governor Stephen Poloz indicated that the underlying growth in economic potential was \"the most important input\" into the neutral rate.\\n\\nPotential growth is a function of the estimated growth in hours worked and how much output per hour can be produced, which itself is linked to the amount of machinery they have to work with. The \"more-intense challenges in the energy sector\" is the main driver of a softer outlook for productivity through 2021, the Bank of Canada said in its monetary policy report.\\n\\nStrong increases in immigration and non-permanent residents, which boost labor\\'s contribution to the Canadian economy\\'s speed limit, aren\\'t enough to offset this dynamic.\\n\\nThe combination of lower potential growth and neutral rates are the latest manifestation of the \"serial disappointments\" from global activity Poloz has long lamented, which have contributed to slower than anticipated Canadian exports and capital spending during his tenure.', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'luke_kawa@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Luke Kawa', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ikjYA9qTqPHM/v1/1200x816.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4745993', 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 983}\n",

With the other trees planted at 3-foot intervals alongside, it\\'s part of what he hopes will be before long a lucrative wall of fruit.\\n\\nIf Gilbert lets nature take its course, the tree and thousands like it planted on this 20-acre orchard in Yakima, Wash., later this year will bear the first crop of Cosmic Crisp, which he and other growers in the state are calling a new blockbuster apple. If instead he chooses to interrupt the fruiting, he\\'ll be letting the tree reinvest its energy -- think of it as the horticultural equivalent of compounding interest -- into growing bigger and stronger faster, which may mean more fruit in the long term.\\n\\nIt\\'s a consequential decision: Gilbert Orchards has invested about $900,000 into the single Cosmic Crisp plot on which he\\'s standing. For the 122-year-old family business, Gilbert says, that amounts to a \"big bet.\" The gamble is all the more risky because growers like him have no experience with this cultivar. Everyone agrees that the cherry red, slightly tart, ever-so-juicy Cosmic Crisp is a good apple for eating, he says, and stays fresh as long as a year in storage. \"Everything else is just guessing.\"\\n\\nFor Gilbert Orchards, whose products wind up in fruit bowls as far away as India and Taiwan, the decision on whether to delay the first harvest of Cosmic Crisps is complicated by the uncertainty bred by Donald Trump\\'s trade wars. Mexico and China have hiked duties on U.S. apple imports in response to Trump\\'s policies. India has threatened to follow suit.\\n\\nAcross Washington state\\'s apple orchards, growers\\' exports have fallen almost 30 percent since last spring. \"We\\'ve been through these kinds of things before, but not with as many markets,\" says Mark Powers, president of the Northwest Horticultural Council. \"It\\'s not like we can divert the millions of cartons that are going to India to Costa Rica.\"\\n\\nSpring is supposed to be a time of optimism in rural communities across America. It\\'s when farmers sow the seeds of prosperity into neat, GPS-calibrated rows and when they pray for just the right amount of rain and sun and for prices to hold up so that when fall approaches, there\\'s a crop worth harvesting. This year is different. In Washington apple orchards, North Carolina hog farms, and soybean fields along the Mississippi River Basin, the season is filled with doubt. After taking a hit to their bottom line in 2018 of the sort that some say they haven\\'t seen since the 1980s, farmers in much of the U.S. are hoping for a return to normalcy.\\n\\nTrump\\'s determination to upend the global trading system comes at an inconvenient time for one of the nation\\'s premier export industries. No country has mastered the science of the ever-increasing yield quite like the U.S. has. It\\'s the world\\'s leading producer of commodity crops such as soybeans and corn and a major source of apples, beef, pork, and wheat. Agriculture has also been an important backer of successive administrations\\' push to seal trade agreements around the world. Pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement have spurred agricultural exports, which have grown 170 percent over the past 20 years.\\n\\nYet U.S. farm profits have been shrinking since they peaked six years ago, amounting last year to roughly half what they were in 2013. As a result of successive years of bumper crops, prices for key commodities like soybeans and corn are about 40 percent lower than they were in 2013. At the same time, farmers have had to contend with the administration\\'s crackdown on immigration, which deprives them of migrant labor, and climate change, which most recently took the form of historic floods that devastated Midwestern agricultural states.\\n\\nThe trade wars have come on top of all that. In the year since the Trump administration launched its tariff offensive, the country\\'s trade partners have retaliated by hiking duties on apples, cherries, ginseng, sorghum, and soybeans, to name a few crops. It\\'s a familiar pattern: American farmers have long borne the cost for protectionist policies pushed by the country\\'s industrialists. The 1828 \"tariff of abominations\" designed to safeguard Northern manufacturers from an influx of lower-priced imports from Britain was opposed stridently in the agrarian South. It led to a political crisis that dogged Andrew Jackson\\'s presidency and precipitated South Carolina\\'s first threats of secession.\\n\\nConscious of the support he garnered in farm states in the 2016 election and the costs they\\'ve been bearing, the president last year announced an aid program of as much as $12 billion to cushion their losses. He\\'s also promised his trade wars will eventually be a boon for the U.S. agricultural economy, whether because of additional Chinese purchases of soybeans and other commodities or the further opening of vital markets such as Japan. \"We\\'re doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you\\'re not even going to believe it,\" he told a cheering crowd at the American Farm Bureau Federation\\'s annual meeting in New Orleans in January. \"Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately. We got to plant.\"\\n\\nStill, plenty of people in farm country are fed up with a fight that\\'s only adding to the widening economic gulf between rural and urban America. \"Why should just a few good patriots take it on the chin for the whole of the country?\" asks Larry Wooten, the outspoken president of the North Carolina Farm Bureau.\\n\\nEconomists are still trying to quantify the impact of Trump\\'s pugnacious protectionism on agriculture. One study by researchers at Iowa State University estimated the various tit-for-tat tariffs imposed in 2018 would cost the farm state as much as $2 billion in lost economic activity, much of it in its corn and pork industries.\\n\\nCalculating the drop in export revenue or the collapse in prices for some commodities isn\\'t difficult, but it\\'s harder to pin numbers on other economic consequences, such as stalled investment. Travel through farm country, and it\\'s hard to find a farmer who doesn\\'t have a story about the combine not bought or the orchard not planted.\\n\\nGilbert\\'s business, which employs the equivalent of 800 people full time and counts big-box retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. as domestic customers, has been hit hard by the trade wars. The operation typically exports a third of its production, according to Gilbert, but shipments from the most recent harvest are down 25 percent from the previous year.\\n\\nTrump\\'s trade wars haven\\'t crimped only Gilbert\\'s revenue; they\\'ve also eaten into his future profits. Instead of replanting 180 acres of the 2,000 or so he manages with new varieties like the Cosmic Crisp that fetch premium prices, he scaled back his plans last year to 120 acres.\\n\\nTalk to people in Washington\\'s apple industry, and they mention the Cosmic Crisp alongside the Granny Smith and the Red Delicious as a revolutionary variety two decades in the making. A product of Washington State University (WSU)\\'s crossbreeding program, it\\'s a singularly crunchy apple whose flesh doesn\\'t brown after it\\'s cut. The variety is also robust enough to ship to far-off lands.\\n\\nGrowers in Washington state will have exclusive rights to the Cosmic Crisp until 2027. But Lynnell Brandt, whom WSU hired to manage its commercialization, already has world apple domination in mind. Anticipating success in China, he\\'s cut a licensing deal with a grower on the mainland, a move he hopes will deter intellectual-property thieves.\\n\\nThe stakes are high. With the cost of planting orchards as much as $60,000 an acre, \"people are taking huge risks to try and get into a fruit that they hope will get them an adequate return,\" Brandt says.\\n\\nMany growers say they have no choice: Labor and other costs have been rising steadily for apple farms, even as consumers have slowly soured on industry stalwarts such as Red Delicious and Galas, which together made up about half of Washington\\'s crop of 120 million boxes last year, according to the Washington Apple Commission. The U.S. domestic market for Washington apples has been static for years, at about 90 million boxes. That puts a premium on developing new export markets and selling higher-margin varieties at home. Honeycrisps fetch as much as $70 a box, more than three times the price of Red Delicious.\\n\\nBut in apple orchards this spring, it\\'s easy to find signs that the trade wars are delaying the transition of an industry that\\'s been dominated by family-owned operations and is only starting to open up to outside capital. \"You are not seeing the sort of investment in orchards or planting equipment that you would normally see,\" says Powers, head of the Northwest Horticultural Council.\\n\\nNature may still wield more power to disrupt farmers\\' lives than tariffs. The Iowa Farm Bureau has estimated that losses from recent flooding along the Missouri River, as well as potential flooding from local rainfall and snowmelt in states to the north, could cause more than $2 billion in damage in the state.\\n\\nAt Andy Jobman\\'s farm in central Nebraska, the Platte River, a tributary of the Missouri, overflowed its banks last month, leaving some fields under as much as 8 feet of water. When the floodwaters receded, they left behind muddy debris that needed to be carted away and a host of delayed tasks -- from applying fertilizer to tilling -- to prepare the fields for new crops.\\n\\nJobman, who farms 1,200 acres of soybeans and corn with his father and brother, can\\'t escape the persistent uncertainty caused by the trade wars. Because of the collapse in demand for soybeans last year, his family stored some of the harvest. Aid payments doled out by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have helped plug the revenue hole, but most financial decision-making has \"slowed down,\" he says, because it\\'s hard to get a bead on where prices are headed.\\n\\nOne open question is whether business will revert to normal if tariffs are lifted. History has shown that even a short interruption in the supply of a commodity can have long-term consequences for American farmers. A U.S. trade spat with Japan in the 1980s that lasted only days helped trigger an increase of investment in Brazil\\'s soybean sector, now the biggest U.S. competitor for that crop. China\\'s punitive tariffs on U.S. soybean imports have prompted pig farmers on the mainland to find alternative sources of feed, says Veronica Nigh, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation. It\\'s not clear whether they\\'ll ever resume purchases on the same scale, even if Beijing commits to buying more U.S. soybeans as part of a trade deal.\\n\\nDaniel Kowalski, a vice president of agricultural lender CoBank ACB, worries that one of the most enduring effects of the trade war may be the expansion in crop production from South America to the Black Sea \"to fill space we vacated.\" The reality is that, under Trump, the U.S. has so far been losing more access to lucrative agricultural export markets than it\\'s been gaining. The president\\'s withdrawal from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership immediately after he took office left U.S. beef and pork producers at a disadvantage in Japan, as well as in fast-growing economies such as Vietnam, vs. competitors in Australia and New Zealand, which remain in the TPP. European Union farmers are also benefiting from a trade pact with Japan that went into effect on Feb. 1.\\n\\nThe fight with China has hurt American soybean growers and other agricultural exporters. But so have Canada\\'s and Mexico\\'s retaliation against Trump\\'s steel tariffs. That\\'s the big reason Chuck Grassley, the powerful Iowa Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, has said duties on Canadian and Mexican steel will have to be lifted before Congress ratifies the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump\\'s replacement for Nafta.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the productivity of America\\'s farm and livestock sectors keeps climbing, generating even greater food surpluses that will continue to depress prices if buyers can\\'t be found overseas. \"Keeping farmers and agribusinesses healthy becomes more challenging if we can\\'t grow the export markets like we have in the past,\" CoBank\\'s Kowalski says.\\n\\nIn Ville Platte, La., Richard Fontenot tills land his family has tended for five generations. The souring of the export relationship with China last year cost him $300,000 in the form of 1,000 acres of soybeans he was forced to leave in the field to rot because the grain bins on his property were already full, as were the export-driven elevators he sells to. Insurance covered some of the losses, but when he tried to tap into the aid the Trump administration made available for farmers hurt by the trade wars, he was told he wasn\\'t eligible because he hadn\\'t harvested the crop. So there\\'s been belt-tightening. Instead of shelling out $300,000 for a used combine as planned, Fontenot spent $30,000 to rehab his existing machine. \"I had a crop in the field that I couldn\\'t export because of the tariffs,\" he says.\\n\\nFontenot, who like many farmers in what\\'s known as the Cajun Prairie raises rice and crawfish alongside his soybeans, is keeping a wary eye on a near-record stockpile of soybeans nationally and on the Mississippi\\'s high waters. He remains a Trump supporter, as are most voters in Evangeline Parish, where the president won almost 70 percent of the vote in 2016. His hope is that the losses he\\'s taken on soybeans will be salved by future rice sales to China. \"He\\'s costing me money today, but I think he\\'s going to make me money in the future,\" Fontenot says.\\n\\nTrump\\'s tariffs -- and the effect they\\'re having on investment -- are hurting business at Hog Slat, the 50-year-old family business David Herring runs with his brother in the North Carolina hamlet of Newton Grove, where their grandfather\\'s hardware store once stood. Hog Slat makes everything it takes to build the vast sheds that house pigs, from the slotted floors that gave the business its name to feed bins and ventilation systems. It also assembles the sheds. Over the past year, its business has slowed.\\n\\nThere have been other blows, too. Steel tariffs raised the price of the domestic metal the company uses. Herring\\'s own hog business was hit by the retaliatory duties imposed by Mexico, the biggest export market for U.S. pork by volume, and the resulting collapse in prices. Hog Slat is a private company, and Herring, who earlier this year assumed the rotating presidency of the National Pork Producers Council, won\\'t disclose its financials, saying only that \"there was a lot of money lost\" and he had to lay off 80 of his 1,500 employees in the U.S.\\n\\nIn a community where conservatism is the rule, farmers remain optimistic that the president they voted for in 2016 will live up to his pledge to make it up to farmers, Herring says. It helps that they\\'ve benefited from Trump\\'s deregulatory agenda, including laxer federal rules for water use, as well as cuts to business and estate taxes. But \"patience is not where it was six months ago,\" he says. And that forbearance may not survive another year like the last.\\n\\nFor Lorenda Overman, 2018 was the worst year she\\'s seen in the 37 since she married a farmer and moved onto the patch of North Carolina that her husband\\'s family has owned and nurtured since before the Revolutionary War. There was the economic storm that came in the form of the trade wars, and then there was Hurricane Florence, which turned harvest time into a scramble to salvage crops. For the first time, the Overmans had to delay writing the monthly checks that support the families of two of their grown children, who live and work alongside them on the farm. \"You are taking the food right out of the mouths of your grandchildren,\" she says.\\n\\nNow she\\'s worried about numbers that don\\'t pencil out even before some crops have been planted. At current prices, this year\\'s corn, wheat, and soybeans are set to yield almost $290,000 in losses, by her calculations. And that\\'s if nothing else goes wrong. But she hasn\\'t lost hope in Trump. If the man whom she voted for and cheered from the sixth row at the Farm Bureau convention cuts a deal with China, she hopes markets will respond. \"A swipe of the pen, and those prices can bounce back,\" she says.\\n\\nSome of the changes brought on by Trump\\'s trade offensive may linger, though. The 7,500 hogs that spend 18 weeks at a time housed in six sheds on the Overmans\\' farm in Goldsboro are owned by what\\'s known in the industry as an \"integrator.\" To fatten them up from 10-week-old piglets into 250-pound to 300-pound beasts, the family is paid a set rate that hasn\\'t changed in a decade. But in part because of trade war losses, the integrator will be phasing out its multiyear contracts and replacing them with 120-day ones, a switch that will leave the family more exposed to the vagaries of the markets. The change won\\'t happen till 2021. Overman hopes the family business can stick it out until then. \"I\\'m praying every night,\" she says, \"that we are not in the same place we are a year from now.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'shruti_singh@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Shruti Singh', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'shawn_donnan@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Shawn Donnan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i65BeuHMQ9jg/v2/1200x960.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 976}\n",

Barr delivered to Congress his four-page summary of the special counsel\\'s 300-plus page report.\\n\\n\"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that day. And in the weeks that followed, the president\\'s message of vindication and revenge on his political antagonists has only intensified, as he has expressed no interest in reading the full report and leveled charges of treason against Democratic lawmakers.\\n\\nMr. Barr\\'s letter effectively emboldened Mr. Trump, aides said, even as they prepare for new details to emerge from a redacted version of the report -- expected this week -- that could renew questions about the president\\'s fitness for office, and even as some of them cringe at Mr. Trump\\'s choice of the word \"exonerate.\" (Privately, they admit, they would prefer he use the word \"vindicate.\")\\n\\nBut Mr. Trump\\'s mood has been lighter since the report was filed, people close to him said, even though neither he nor his White House lawyers have seen the full document, or at this point plan to do so before it is released to Congress and to the public. People close to Mr. Trump said they have noticed an increase in his confidence after he spent months feeling weighed down by a loss of control.\\n\\n\"When they began to go after people he knew personally, who had worked for him for years, I think it gnawed at him, and I think he felt helpless,\" said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a confidant of Mr. Trump\\'s.\\n\\nBut since Mr. Barr issued his letter, the president has felt liberated and has been testing his bounds. He has poked fun at Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president considering a presidential run, for his handsy approach to politics, despite his own troubled history with women. He has floated the idea of a pardon for Kevin McAleenan, now his acting homeland security secretary, if he encountered any legal problems in shutting the southwestern border. And he has heightened his attacks on the press beyond his normal refrain of \"fake news,\" falsely claiming that journalists are \"knowingly\" bending the truth.\\n\\nNow, as Mr. Barr prepares to submit a redacted version of the report, Mr. Trump\\'s plan of attack, aides said, is to act as if the report itself is extraneous to Mr. Barr\\'s brief letter.\\n\\n\"The bottom line: The result is no collusion, no obstruction, and that\\'s the way it is,\" the president told reporters on Thursday. He said that Democrats \"know it\\'s all a big scam, a big hoax\" and that he believed what they were doing was \"actually treason.\" Days earlier, en route to Texas, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don\\'t care about the Mueller report. I\\'ve been totally exonerated.\"\\n\\nMr. Trump is purposefully escalating his language, people who know him said, expressly to enliven his base of supporters and to enrage his political rivals and the news media. He has revived an idea that his administration rejected -- sending immigrant detainees to so-called sanctuary cities -- in part, people close to him said, to distract from the report.\\n\\n\"The president clearly feels vindicated now that the Mueller report is completed,\" said Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, who recently taped a radio interview with Mr. Trump. \"He will continue to remind the American people he was correct about there being no evidence of collusion with Russia.\"\\n\\nOther outside surrogates have been echoing Mr. Trump\\'s line -- that the narrative has already been established and it is too late for new facts to change that -- even though members of the special counsel\\'s team have expressed concern that Mr. Barr\\'s letter did not accurately portray the contents of the report.\\n\\n\"The facts are that there was no collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia, no obstruction of justice and President Trump has been fully vindicated,\" said Boris Epshteyn, a former White House aide who now serves as the chief political commentator for Sinclair Broadcast Group. \"No amount of spin by the opponents is going to change that.\"\\n\\nBut critics said the strategy is classic Trump -- effective with a narrow audience, but ultimately self-limiting. \"He will probably have succeeded in setting the narrative for his core supporters and hardening their attitudes, but at the expense of anyone else believing him when the report comes out and inevitably undermines what he\\'s been claiming,\" said Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman under former President Barack Obama. \"The same things that solidify his base just prevent him from expanding beyond it at all.\"\\n\\nNeal K. Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, said that such an approach could backfire. \"Whatever Trump may have thought when he claimed total exoneration two weeks ago, subsequent events strongly suggest that claim will fall flat on its face,\" he said. \"And because Trump claimed total exoneration from the report, he created massive public pressure for the full report to be released.\"\\n\\nInside the White House, there is only a bare-bones plan in place for how to handle the release of the redacted report, people familiar with the matter said. Emmet T. Flood, the White House counsel, is expected to spend the day reading the report and to brief the president on its findings.\\n\\nThe White House has not asked to read the report in advance, and aides are planning to speed read. They intend to all but skip the sections related to potential criminal conspiracy, and instead zoom in on two outstanding questions that Mr. Trump himself wants to ignore: why Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, was not able to conclude whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, and what the attorney general meant when he wrote in his letter that \"much\" of the president\\'s conduct was public -- meaning some of it was not.\\n\\nBut many acknowledge they are still operating largely in the dark, with guesswork about what the report will reveal about Mr. Trump\\'s behavior in office.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, would not disclose how the legal team plans to address the report, but he said it would be similar to how the White House responded after Mr. Barr sent his summary to Congress.\\n\\n\"Our goal is to respond as quick as we can; given the length of the report, it may take some time to respond,\" Mr. Sekulow said. \"But we have a plan in place to respond in a professional manner as quickly and appropriately as possible.\"\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s top aides and some relatives have also been eager for their own vindication. After months of being mocked by reporters for his seemingly off-script moments, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president\\'s lawyers, recently texted an article in The Federalist titled \"Rudy Giuliani Knew Exactly What He Was Doing\" to a wide list of journalists.\\n\\nJared Kushner, the president\\'s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, who was believed to have been a focus of investigators, made a rare appearance on Fox News last week and insisted he never had any real concern.\\n\\n\"I was never worried, because I never thought the notion that we did that,\" Mr. Kushner said, referring to whether the campaign conspired with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. \"We ran a great campaign. The president had a great message, and that\\'s why we won.\"\\n\\nMr. Kushner, who faced difficulties getting a security clearance and was ultimately granted one on the president\\'s orders, added, \"Over the last few years that I\\'ve been here, I\\'ve been accused of all different types of things, and all of those things have turned out to be false.\"\\n\\nThe White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" reinforced the idea that Mr. Trump has been emboldened by Mr. Barr\\'s summary, pushing back when the show\\'s host, Chris Wallace, asked, \"How are you going to deal with some evidence that\\'s going to come out in this report that clearly is going to be damaging to the president?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it is going to be damaging,\" Ms. Sanders said. \"We consider this to be case closed.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'annie_karni@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Annie Karni', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/business/14dc-muellerspin/14dc-muellerspin-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4728133', 'sentiment': 0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 958}\n",

He was expected to be charged with kidnapping; arson; resisting arrest; intention to commit mass murder, because some students were still on the bus when it burst into flames; and terrorism as an aggravating factor, because he \"created panic and threatened Italian institutions,\" said Alberto Nobili, one of the Milanese prosecutors assigned to the case.\\n\\nMr. Sy told prosecutors that he had acted alone and that he intended to send a message to African immigrants \"not to come to Europe, but at the same time to punish Europe for what he saw as its unacceptable migration policies,\" Mr. Nobili said at a news conference in Milan on Wednesday night.\\n\\nThe students, who attend a middle school in Crema, a city some 50 kilometers, or almost 32 miles, east of Milan, were returning from gym class when Mr. Sy, a regular driver on the route, poured gasoline down the bus\\'s center aisle and announced that he was hijacking it and taking them to Linate Airport in Milan, investigators said.\\n\\nHe then gave zip ties to the three adults, ordering them to tie each child\\'s wrists together as he drove.

In contrast, Toronto took in C$526 million of Asian investment last year, up slightly from 2017, including a C$256 million purchase of an office building by Chinese private investor Tigra Vista Inc.\\n\\nChinese investors are retreating globally following government restrictions on capital outflows in 2016. In Vancouver, Asian investment dropped off even more last year due in part to a series of new taxes instituted by the government, including a speculation and wealth tax on homes. The province has also proposed a bill to expose hidden land owners -- both residential and commercial -- and failure to disclose may result in a fine of C$100,000 or 15 percent of the property\\'s assessed value, whichever is greater, is driving away some investors.\\n\\n\"You have policy changes on a snap, on a whim,\" David Ho, executive vice president at CBRE Ltd., said in an interview at Bloomberg\\'s Vancouver office. \"Investors typically look at stability in a market and this is not stability.\"\\n\\nThe numbers provided by CBRE are only based on known buyers though many \"go to great lengths to protect their identities and remain confidential,\" the brokerage firm said.\\n\\nHo focuses on bringing in new Asian capital to North American cities and while 90 percent of his business was in Vancouver last year, he predicts the city may account for only a fraction of the foreign capital this year with more deals done in Toronto. In total, Asian capital flows are projected to take up less than 20 percent of Vancouver\\'s commercial market, said Vancouver-based CBRE broker Tony Quattrin, compared to over 25 percent in the past three years.\\n\\nLast month, Blackstone Group LP and Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. teamed up to buy Anbang-owned Bentall Centre in Vancouver. The Chinese insurance firm has been ramping up efforts to offload assets after being temporarily seized by the nation\\'s regulator.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, Chinese investment \"had always been predicated on land, placing bets on land, whether it\\'s old shopping centers or office buildings even -- they see underlying development and land value,\" Bal Atwal, a principal at brokerage firm Avison Young, said. \"They\\'re looking at Toronto now because they\\'re seeing a better arbitrage on that than they are here.\"\\n\\nAsian investors, who previously had marginal interest in looking east of Vancouver given the flood of opportunities, are now being forced to diversify their holdings. To cater to growing demand, CBRE is planning to shift more of its focus to bringing Asian investors to Toronto, which has a booming tech and financial services market, fueled by a flood of immigrants and millennials.\\n\\n\"That spells money because young people have to consume, they\\'re growing families,\" Ho said. \"That\\'s a huge advantage against the Vancouver market, which is more of a retirement market.\"\\n\\nWhile money has been migrating away from Vancouver during the past few months, the shift may not be a permanent exit, said Robert Veerman, a CBRE sales associate. People are still trying to understand what the long-term effects will be of the British Columbia government\\'s policies.\\n\\n\"It\\'ll be very volatile for awhile but right now there\\'s no panic in the market, just some jitters,\" Ho said. \"How the government works out the policies moving forward a year, two years from now if they haven\\'t stabilized the psyche of the market, then would panic set in?

That way, the theory goes, the affluent won\\'t push into less-expensive enclaves nearby.\\n\\nTwo miles away, Sarah Ashton is already feeling the pressure to sell her 12-unit apartment building in the working-class Alexandria neighborhood of Arlandria. The offers keep coming, and Amazon.com Inc. hasn\\'t even arrived yet. But while she may get a windfall, she worries about her tenants, the Central American-born construction laborers, cleaners, and restaurant workers who populate \"Chirilagua,\" as locals call the community near Reagan National Airport. \"When high-tech firms come, it stimulates inequality,\" says Derek Hyra, a professor of public policy at American University in Washington and a former Alexandria city planning commissioner. \"The lower-rent areas like Arlandria in close proximity face the biggest threat.\"\\n\\nAmazon\\'s selection of an area of Northern Virginia dubbed National Landing was celebrated by local leaders as a huge economic win. Now they\\'re preparing for the housing market fallout from the arrival of tens of thousands of tech workers earning an average of $150,000 each. JBG Smith Properties, which owns most of the commercial space in Crystal City, says the best way to prevent displacement is to give those new employees a wealth of choices suitable to their salaries. That means a protective wall of luxury apartments with dog-grooming stations and rooftop lounges. \"If you build really close to the headquarters and in places that are already high-income, then there is less demand for investors to buy up older, garden-style apartments in Arlandria,\" says Jenny Schuetz, a fellow at the Brookings Institution\\'s Metropolitan Policy Program.\\n\\nJBG plans to construct 4,000 to 5,000 high-end rental units in and around Crystal City, says Executive Vice President Evan Regan-Levine. \"One of the things we think we can do to minimize the impact is to build as much of the high-end as possible,\" Regan-Levine says. \"And add speed to getting that stuff done by streamlining approvals so these buildings can deliver in time for the people coming.\"\\n\\nOne potential flaw: hipsters. One person\\'s luxury condo is another\\'s soulless box. Many young people aren\\'t interested in living in a community of high-rise condo towers like Crystal City, says Hyra, who studies gentrification. Many will end up in Arlandria and other nearby communities. \"My feeling is that many of Amazon\\'s workers won\\'t choose to be directly in Crystal City, because of its sterile, corporate feel,\" he says. Regan-Levine says Crystal City will be more attractive after the redevelopment, with trendy restaurants and coffee shops, as well as new parks.\\n\\nIn a statement, Amazon says it was drawn to the area in part because state and local governments had plans to address affordable housing, and that it planned to hire many people who already live there. The company also says new jobs in the region would come \"gradually,\" starting with about 400 expected in 2019.\\n\\nThe second part of JBG\\'s strategy to preserve the area\\'s last affordable units is a $150 million impact fund it\\'s raising. Investors would get a 7 percent return on their money, which would be loaned to nonprofit developers to purchase D.C.-area apartments at risk of being upgraded, says A.J. Jackson, the company\\'s executive vice president for social impact investing. The developers would be required to keep the units affordable for at least 15 years.\\n\\nHenver Palma, 54, and his family were among the refugees from El Salvador\\'s civil war in the 1980s to settle in Chirilagua. From his perch behind the counter, he scans his Super H barber shop -- mirrors, faded photos of hair styles, green leather chairs, combs soaking in jars of alcohol -- and sighs. The business he built with his wife over the past 15 years most likely won\\'t survive Amazon, he says. \"It\\'s for low-income people,\" Palma said. \"A haircut is $15.\"\\n\\nHe leaves the store and climbs up to Mount Vernon Avenue, lined in Chirilagua with businesses including a check-cashing shop, Salvadoran restaurant, and convenience store, and points left down the street toward neighboring Del Ray. That\\'s the future, he says. Less than a mile away, a hamburger at Holy Cow can cost $13, mixed-berry cobbler is on special for about $6 at the Dairy Godmother frozen-custard shop, and haircuts at Salon Bisoux (French for \"kiss\") start at $48 for men and $93 for women. \"This whole community will have to move,\" Palma says.\\n\\nIt\\'s a Wednesday evening, and Evelin Urrutia, lead organizer at Tenants and Workers United in Chirilagua, knocks on doors of residents at Presidential Greens, a 396-unit brick apartment complex owned by UDR Inc., a large national apartment landlord. UDR did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nA man dressed in baggy blue shorts answers one door. Clipboard in hand, Urrutia tells him in Spanish that Amazon is coming, and so are a lot of wealthy workers who will drive up rents. She\\'s conducting a survey and asks the man, a 46-year-old Honduran immigrant, about his housing costs. He says he\\'s already concerned about the cost of living in the area; working construction at commercial building sites, he earns $23,000 a year, though it\\'s hard to find work in the winter. He lives with two roommates, and the trio can barely afford the $1,500 a month rent, which climbs about $70 every year.\\n\\nThe future of such residents is what takes up most of Helen McIlvaine\\'s time these days. She\\'s Alexandria\\'s housing director, though she has a different description of her job: \"I\\'m the girl with her finger in the dike.\" Already, 90 percent of the market-rate apartments that were affordable in 2000 in Alexandria no longer are because of steady rent increases. McIlvaine says the city is committed to making sure Amazon benefits all residents, not just the ones most likely to get jobs there. That means protecting neighborhoods like Chirilagua and nearby Columbia Pike, she says.\\n\\nThere\\'s new money to help. The Virginia Housing Development Authority, a nonprofit created by the state, is kicking in an extra $15 million a year, for five years, for affordable housing in the Northern Virginia area. Alexandria has budgeted another $8 million a year. And if the city\\'s landlords want to redevelop their property, they\\'ll have a new incentive to keep rents affordable -- at least for the number of apartments that currently exist on a site: In exchange they\\'ll be permitted to build three times as many higher-end units. Existing tenants would get priority for the affordable spots in new buildings, she says.\\n\\nThe neighborhood would change with a flood of wealthier residents, who can attract stores and restaurants for more expensive tastes. But the city will try to keep the community intact, McIlvaine says: \"Yes, things are going to change, but this allows you to better shape what will happen. The city is going to have a planning process, and the goal is to make sure the character and diversity everybody loves is preserved.\"\\n\\nAshton, the landlord who\\'s also a former mortgage banker and builder, says even if she doesn\\'t sell, she might be forced to raise rents. Amazon will likely drive up values, and that will lead to higher property taxes, she says. She likes Alexandria\\'s plan to allow more units for landlords who agree to preserve some affordable ones. And she thinks tax breaks for landlords who keep rents low might also work. \"What incentive now do we have to keep this affordable?\" Ashton asks rhetorically, as she points to some more expensive units that have crept onto a block of Chirilagua. \"If someone gives us a pile of cash, why wouldn\\'t we take it?\"', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'prashant_gopal@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Prashant Gopal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iW4N30Mgiz5U/v0/1200x800.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1215686274509804, 'wgt': 911}\n",

The GoFundMe Campaign to Build the Wall Is a Bust', 'body': 'Back in December, Washington state Trump supporter Joshua Greene donated a small amount of money to the crowdfunding effort to build a wall along the southern border. He wasn\\'t alone. The GoFundMe page to build the wall, to which he\\'d donated, was a sensation on the right in late 2018 and raised more than $20 million.\\n\\nOrganized by triple-amputee veteran Brian Kolfage, the campaign eventually morphed into a nonprofit called We Build the Wall, which promised to build portions of the wall on private land using the money it raised.\\n\\nMonths later, there\\'s no evidence that any construction has started, despite claims from Kolfage and his allies that construction would start in April. And now Greene is wondering what ever happened to that wall he was promised his dollars would fund?\\n\\n\"The lack of updates is very concerning,\" Greene wrote in an email to Right Richter.\\n\\nHe\\'s not the only GoFundMe donor curious about what happened to the wall money. Since We Build the Wall blew their April deadline, Twitter replies to Kolfage and the group\\'s Facebook page have filled up with angry donors. Greene started tweeting his displeasure, too.\\n\\nWe Build the Wall has frequently presented itself as poised to start building portions of the wall on private land. In February, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- who is a member of We Build the Wall\\'s board of directors -- claimed that the group was \"getting ready to break ground, probably in April.\"\\n\\nKolfage himself went further, saying in a radio interview in March that \"we\\'re going to start breaking ground next month.\" The group had even promised to invite donors to a groundbreaking ceremony.\\n\\nMore than a week into May, though, We Build the Wall hasn\\'t shown any proof that any ground has been broken, and donors say they weren\\'t any invited to any promised groundbreaking ceremony.\\n\\nDonors to the group have begun taking out their frustrations on the organization\\'s Facebook page, which often hypes the threat of immigrants crossing the border illegally.\\n\\n\"Show me video of wall being built and I\\'ll pony up my next donation,\" reads one angry Facebook comment.\\n\\n\"Where is the rest of the money going?\" reads another.\\n\\nMaking donors more nervous is that Kolfage has a history of participating in questionable endeavors. He was a prolific operator of hoax pages on Facebook, and money he raised in the past to help veterans\\' programs in hospitals never actually went to those hospitals.\\n\\nComplicating the effort further is that it\\'s not that easy to find private land right on the border where a wall can be built.\\n\\nKolfage and We Build the Wall\\'s board of directors have spent plenty of time in Arizona, ostensibly scouting private land to build the wall. But The Phoenix New Times reported in March that the \"vast majority\" of land on the border in Arizona is owned by the federal government. Meanwhile, many of the people who actually own land on the border told the New Times that they hadn\\'t been contacted by We Build the Wall.\\n\\nWe Build the Wall didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. In a Facebook comment this week, the group claimed, once again, that it was very close to building the wall. Conveniently, though, We Build the Wall claimed the information about the private wall\\'s location had to be \"secure\" in order to confound liberal foes.\\n\\n\"VERY soon we can release the details but have to keep that information secure for the time being as to prevent giving our detractors a heads up to derail our progress,\" the statement reads. \"Soon, everyone will have the update they\\'ve been waiting for which we can\\'t wait to share. This updated delay is just the unfortunate process of building a controversial barrier some people don\\'t want to happen.\"\\n\\nKolfage has made similar statements in the past, claiming in a March radio interview that he can\\'t say where the wall will be built because Trump critics like the American Civil Liberties Union would try to stop it.\\n\\n\"I wish I could name where it\\'s at, but we can\\'t name it because of the ACLU, these other liberal groups that want to sue us and impede our progress,\" Kolfage said. \"But it\\'s actually happening.\"\\n\\nAs for Greene, he\\'s fed up with the lack of information about the campaign he financially supported.\\n\\n\"I knew Brian had some previous shady gofundme campaigns,\" Greene emailed. \"I felt more confident when He brought on other big names to work with him, I haven\\'t seen a tweet from ANY of them.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'thedailybeast.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Beast'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'will_sommer@thedailybeast.com', 'name': 'Will Sommer', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_562,w_1000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1557447882/190510-sommer-go-fund-me-border-wall-hero-trello_bikb7d', 'eventUri': 'eng-4782459', 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'wgt': 907}\n",

Edmond Martin was also the inspiration for a character in the 1950s Broadway musical \"Wonderful Town.\"\\n\\nMartin\\'s own residence, the landmarked pink-stucco double town house at 114 Waverly Place, is currently on the market for $11 million. The Art Nouveau building includes a studio on the fourth floor with 16-foot vaulted ceilings that was used by at least two renowned city artists.\\n\\nFour of the other buildings that make up the Martin estate are landmarked Federal-style town houses that share frontage on Gay and Christopher streets. The buildings, which share utilities and measure more than 10,000 square feet in combined space, are on sale for $11.5 million, according to Stephen P. Wald Real Estate Associates, which is selling the entire Martin portfolio.\\n\\nAcross the street, at 17 Gay St., Martin\\'s Greek Revival three-story row house, built in 1844, is also on the market for $2.5 million. The building has eight units, the majority of them occupied by rent-stabilized tenants.\\n\\nIn all, Martin\\'s buildings house 30 rental apartments with kitchenettes that were installed by her father, who amassed his mini-empire in the 1920s. Her mother, Ramee, decorated and furnished the rental units. She died in 1977.\\n\\nNeighbors told The Post that Martin, who took over the buildings after her father\\'s death in 1985, let many of the apartments fall into disrepair and simply refused to charge rent. Some of the lower floors are so rat-infested that they are uninhabitable, a neighbor said.\\n\\n\"Celeste Martin created a magical oasis for wayward artists and all-round misfits,\" Russell Brown said in a recent tribute on social media. \"We were safe in our two-hundred year old homes that tilted gently from the constantly rumbling subway and weight of the abundant wisteria vines.\"\\n\\nAnother longtime neighbor told The Post that although Martin had been offered \"millions and millions of dollars\" from a Russian oligarch to buy one of her buildings, Martin refused.\\n\\n\"She wanted to protect her tenants,\" said Jeanne Kelly, who lives on Gay Street and is a retired fossil expert at the American Museum of Natural History.\\n\\nMartin, who said she worked as a stage actress and dancer although no one quite knew where, lived between apartments in her buildings.\\n\\nBut she liked best to recline in a red minivan on Waverly Place, a neighbor told The Post. The back seats were removed to accommodate two lounge chairs, the neighbor said.\\n\\n\"I know she loved KFC,\" said Myles Tacher, 29, a real-estate-developer neighbor. \"She had a heart of gold. She was always friendly.\"\\n\\nShe was also a regular at Pride Day celebrations.\\n\\n\"She had a little balcony on the third floor,\" said Edward Dunne, a clinical psychologist who lived across the street from Martin for 45 years.\\n\\n\"She would wear a halter top that I would consider pretty provocative and a pair of short shorts.

That flood relief was included in the package passed on Friday, which should intensify pressure on the Senate to reach an agreement with or without the president.\\n\\n\"Disaster‑struck communities can\\'t afford the Republicans\\' inaction on this,\" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, speaking at a news conference on Thursday. \"They haven\\'t taken up one bill. They haven\\'t initiated their own bill.\"\\n\\n\"Hopefully,\" she added, \"the combination of our earlier bill and this bill that addresses more recent disasters will be something that they will let us proceed on.\"\\n\\nSo far Mr. Trump has not softened his opposition, primarily focused on the money allocated to Puerto Rico\\'s recovery from devastating hurricanes in 2017. Just as he claimed that his trade war has helped farmers, despite plunging commodity prices and a closing Chinese market, the president asserted this week that billions of dollars in relief for farm states would harm farmers.\\n\\n\"House Republicans should not vote for the BAD DEMOCRAT Disaster Supplemental Bill which hurts our States, Farmers & Border Security,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter late Thursday. \"We want to do much better than this. All sides keep working and send a good BILL for immediate signing!\"\\n\\nThough most Republicans are still voting with the president, their frustration is beginning to show. Representative Austin Scott, Republican of Georgia, blasted the White House budget office at a House Agriculture Committee hearing on Thursday, saying budget office officials \"consider the American farmer and the American farm family nothing but subsidy-sucking freeloaders.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a disconnect in what is actually coming out of the administration and what the administration is telling us that they\\'re going to do,\" he said.\\n\\nThe standoff in Washington is having real-world impact. Puerto Ricans saw their first increase in nutritional assistance expire in March. Coastal states are urgently awaiting reconstruction funding less than a month before the next hurricane season begins. And farmers across the southeast and Midwest are still reeling from floods and tornadoes as they brace for a new round of tariffs likely to be imposed on their crops by China in retaliation for tariffs imposed on Chinese exports by the Trump administration on Friday.\\n\\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained falsely that $91 billion has been sent to the island since the 2017 hurricanes. About $41 billion in aid has been allocated to the island, according to the Office of Management and Budget, while $91 billion -- the number Mr. Trump frequently cites -- is the budget office\\'s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades.\\n\\nHis treatment of the American territory has rankled allies of the island, which does not have voting congressional representation, and prompted a number of Boston Red Sox players to boycott a World Series celebration at the White House Thursday, including the team\\'s manager Alex Cora, a native of Puerto Rico.\\n\\n\"It is un-American to deny nutrition assistance to American citizens living in Puerto Rico, particularly children,\" said Representative Nydia Velázquez, Democrat of New York and the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the House, in a speech on the House floor. \"We should be ashamed that the richest country -- the most powerful country in the world -- that we allow children to suffer this way.\"\\n\\nAdding a new complication, the White House demanded $4.5 billion in emergency funding for the southwestern border earlier this month and is now pushing to combine the two supplemental spending requests.\\n\\nThe Defense Department on Friday is expected to divert another $1.5 billion from other military projects and programs to the construction of barriers at the southwestern border.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s Thursday evening tweet urging that House Republicans oppose the bill was not a presidential thought tossed off lightly.

Rich not paying enough', 'body': 'What happens to low-tax states when people fleeing high-tax states settle there?\\n\\nAccording to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday, voters\\' top tax concern isn\\'t how much they pay. Instead, they are most concerned about the rich not paying enough (34 percent) and the way the government spends the money (28 percent).\\n\\nAbout 1 in 10 say what bothers them most is the amount they pay (12 percent), too many people don\\'t have to pay at all (12 percent), and the complexity of the system (10 percent).\\n\\nCompared to 2014, the last time the question was asked, there has been an increase in voters who are troubled that the rich aren\\'t paying enough (+6 points). The shift in frustration comes mainly from self-identified liberals (+20) and voters under age 30 (+14 points). However, it\\'s not limited to traditional left-leaning groups -- voters ages 65 and over (+14), voters earning $50k and over (+11), and whites without a college degree (+9) are also increasingly bothered by the wealthy not pulling their weight.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS.\\n\\n\"One underappreciated aspect of the past two years is the Democrats have fought the president to a draw on taxes,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"While the Democrats managed to regain their edge on health care, they also reframed the tax debate in terms of fairness and breaks for the wealthy, which has prevented President Trump and the GOP from gaining any substantial political benefit from their tax reform.\"\\n\\nIn December 2017, President Trump marked a campaign promise off his list as the Republican-led Congress passed a sweeping tax reform bill. At that time, former House Speaker Paul Ryan said, \"The message to the hardworking taxpayers of America is: Your tax relief is on its way. That is what\\'s happening here. The message to the families in America who\\'ve been struggling, paycheck and paycheck -- your tax rates are going down and your paychecks are going up.\"\\n\\nVoters don\\'t entirely share Ryan\\'s view. Last month, the Fox News Poll found voters split over the new tax law: 34 percent favorable vs. 36 percent unfavorable. Thirty percent were unable to rate it.\\n\\nIn addition, the new poll finds 55 percent of voters think their taxes are \"too high,\" and that\\'s about where that number has stood since the Fox News Poll first asked the question 15 years ago (2004).\\n\\nHowever, while the overall numbers held steady, a role reversal recently took place in the background.\\n\\nConsider this: The number of Democrats who say their taxes are too high is 59 percent. It was 49 percent in 2018 and 45 percent in 2017. That\\'s a 14-point increase since Trump won.\\n\\nAn even bigger swing happened among Republicans -- in the opposite direction. Sixty-eight percent said their taxes were too high in 2017 and 59 percent in 2018. Now, 50 percent feel that way. That\\'s an 18-point drop since their candidate won, and a 9-point decrease since passage of the GOP tax reform bill.\\n\\n\"No one ever claimed that partisans are logically consistent,\" says Shaw. \"With a Republican president, Republican voters are less likely to think their tax burden is unfair. Meanwhile, with Trump in the White House Democrats think taxes are too high -- but they also support substantial increases in federal spending.\"\\n\\nOverall, 37 percent say their tax bill is \"about right.\" Three percent think they pay too little.\\n\\nTrump\\'s job performance on taxes has taken a hit since last year. In March 2018, more voters approved than disapproved of him on taxes by 2 points (48-46 percent). Today, he is underwater by 6 (42-48 percent). Drops in approval among independents (-12 points) and Democrats (-8) account for that downward shift.\\n\\n\"Over a year since Trump signed his tax cuts into law, voters just aren\\'t feeling it,\" says Anderson. \"His job approval for handling taxes is down, while more people say their taxes are too high and the rich aren\\'t paying their fair share.\"\\n\\nTrump receives his only net positive job rating on the economy (50 percent approve vs. 42 percent disapprove). He gets a net -2 on North Korea (42-44 percent), a -13 on immigration (41-54 percent) and -15 on health care (37-52 percent).\\n\\nTrump broke with decades-long precedence when he declined to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign. He continues to decline to make them public.\\n\\nBut voters want transparency. Three-quarters overall (74 percent) and over half of Republicans (54 percent) believe that, in general, \"the president of the United States\" should be required to release his or her tax returns.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIndeed, roughly equivalent numbers want that same transparency from \"congressional leaders like the speaker of the house and senate majority leader\" (76 percent) and \"presidential candidates\" (72 percent).\\n\\nNew York Sen.

Oversight overreach is reckless, but the U.S. House is going rogue.\\n\\nAs a former U.S. House oversight staff director and counsel, having managed countless investigations of Justice, Defense, State and NASA for five years, we focused on waste, fraud and abuse, loss of life at Waco, mismanagement at immigration, defense inventory management, counter-narcotics, interagency coordination - plain vanilla topics intended to make the government work better.\\n\\nTaxpayer-funded oversight is boring, if sensitive - like work of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.

We gave a Democratic administration time to produce them, often accommodating White House counter-offers. Subpoena power was seldom used, although always available. We respected institutional prerogatives, separation of powers, executive authorities, the U.S. Constitution and established case law.\\n\\nNone of that is germane today. What is happening is an abomination. Democrat chairmen - and a U.S. House Speaker - are twisting the oversight process to crass political ends, ignoring historical precedents, institutional norms and prerogatives, the Constitution, statutes and case law on a beeline for impeachment.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Chairman Jerald Nadler, D-N.Y., of the Judiciary Committee led his committee to a party-line vote authorizing a subpoena for the \"full, un-redacted report\" by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Russian interference.\\n\\nDespite a statutory provision that legally places discretion for the report\\'s redaction and release in the Attorney General, 28 CFR 600.9, Nadler stated: \"This committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job, not the attorney general\\'s, to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office.\"\\n\\nDespite case law protecting the secrecy of the 5th Amendment grand jury process from Congress, including privacy rights for testimony, witnesses, documents and names, Nadler wants it all.

Never mind that the president has full authority to grant such clearances, Cummings wants to subject the White House to withering attack for granting clearances to unqualified appointees.\\n\\nThe hypocrisy of this last subpoena is glaring. Why? Because unknown to most Americans, no member of Congress is required to hold a security clearance, despite likelihood many would not be granted Secret, Top Secret or SCI access - based on past felonies, drug use, infidelity, foreign affiliations, and other disqualifying issues.\\n\\nThat is right, the 23 Democrats on Cummings\\' House Oversight Committee - who plan to excoriate White House witnesses on security clearance qualifications, do not hold clearances. That includes Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the avowed socialist, Rashida Tlaib, D-Minn., who uses profanity against thepPresident and swears to impeach him, Jamie Raskin, D-N.Y., who wanted President Trump declared \"incapacitated\" under the 25th Amendment, and others.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nNone of them possess clearances, but all can request and see Secret, Top Secret, SCI and Law Enforcement Sensitive 302\\'s.

Just not the one he rants about.\\n\\nThere is no pressing national security threat -- no invasion of murderers, drug cartels or terrorists. No matter how often Mr. Trump delivers such warnings, they bear little resemblance to the truth.\\n\\nBut as record numbers of Central American families flee violence and poverty in their homelands, they are overwhelming United States border systems, fueling a humanitarian crisis of overcrowding, disease and chaos. The Border Patrol is now averaging 1,200 daily arrests, with many migrants arriving exhausted and sick. Last week, a teenage boy from Guatemala died in government custody, the third death of a minor since December. As resources are strained and the system buckles, the misery grows.\\n\\nSomething needs to be done. Soon. Unfortunately, political gamesmanship once again threatens to hold up desperately needed resources.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the White House sent Congress a request for $4.5 billion in emergency funding to help manage the surge. In a letter to lawmakers, the acting director of the White House\\'s budget office, Russell Vought, sought to convey the scope of the challenge. \"In February, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered more than 76,000 illegal border crossers and inadmissible aliens, and in March that number exceeded 100,000 -- the highest monthly level in more than a decade,\" Mr. Vought wrote. He described what he said were \"alarming numbers\" of women and children jammed into Border Patrol stations never intended as long-term shelters.\\n\\nFunding for vital services is not expected to last through the fiscal year, Mr. Vought said. Most urgently, the program that deals with unaccompanied minors is expected to run dry next month, requiring resources to be diverted from other programs and leading to a further deterioration in conditions.\\n\\nWhile the request is light on specifics, it does draw some important outlines. Nearly three-quarters of the funds, $3.3 billion, would be earmarked for humanitarian needs, with much of it flowing to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency responsible for unaccompanied minors. None of the money would go toward Mr. Trump\\'s border wall.\\n\\nSeveral hundred million dollars would, however, go toward shoring up border security operations, including increasing the number of detention beds overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. This, for Democrats, is a nonstarter.\\n\\nThe debate over the permissible size of the detainee population has grown white hot. Democrats contend that the president brought this housing crisis on himself with his push to scoop up as many noncitizens as possible, rather than prioritizing those considered dangerous, as previous administrations did. Instead of asking for more money, Democrats assert, ICE should redirect existing resources to the border.\\n\\nDetention beds were a sticking point in this winter\\'s budget negotiations as well, ultimately resulting in a convoluted compromise no one seemed to understand. Since then, the issue has festered as the administration has adopted policies that will further swell the detainee population, such as last month\\'s order for immigration judges to keep more migrants locked up while their asylum claims are processed, rather than allow them to post bail.\\n\\nThe Democratic chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, Nita Lowey of New York, said that the administration was seeking billions of dollars to \"double down on cruel and ill-conceived policies\" and bail out ICE for locking up more migrant families than it could humanely accommodate. But until better policies are in place, Democrats need to find a way to provide money for adequate shelter.\\n\\nDemocrats have other, lower-level concerns as well, such as ensuring that the Office of Refugee Resettlement is not used as an enforcement agency or that the contractors and facilities used to care for children meet certain standards. As a condition of handing over additional billions, they are likely to push for at least modest increases in oversight. They should aim to keep such tinkering as narrow and targeted as possible. If the White House is serious about needing the money, it should be prepared to agree to a few conditions -- and convey the need for flexibility to Senate Republicans.\\n\\nAs for the clash over detention beds: Knowing how toxic the matter is, the White House would have been wise to leave it out of a request it needs to advance quickly, postponing that battle for a another day. Both sides need to dial back the fighting words, resist the temptation to finger-point and find a creative way through this minefield.\\n\\nRelatedMore on the strain at the southern border.White House Asks Congress for Billions More in Border FundingMay 1, 2019U.S. Continues to Separate Migrant Families Despite Rollback of PolicyMarch 9, 2019ICE Faces Migrant Detention Crunch as Border Chaos Spills Into Interior of the CountryApril 22, 2019\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Specifically, President Trump has delivered not just solid job growth, but also rising wages. This, when his critics called it impossible.\\n\\nMarch saw nonfarm payrolls grow by 196,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports -- a major rebound from the slowdown in the first two months of the year. And wages grew 3.2 percent over the last 12 months, markedly faster than inflation.\\n\\nUnemployment was 3.8 percent in March, and has been at or below 4 percent for 13 straight months. This is what economists usually call \"full employment,\" but the gains keep coming in part because millions who\\'d given up on even looking for work -- and so were no longer counted as \"unemployed\" -- have rejoined the workforce.\\n\\nAll this, even as Democrats have routinely denounced Trump in the same terms they\\'ve slammed every Republican for decades, as merely favoring the rich.\\n\\nManufacturing has added 480,000 jobs since Trump\\'s election, and 209,000 jobs in the past 12 months. And that boom is something that both President Barack Obama and top liberal economist-pundit Paul Krugman insisted couldn\\'t happen.\\n\\nLiterally: In June 2016, Obama slammed Trump\\'s promises as impossible, saying the then-candidate would need a \"magic wand\" to deliver. Manufacturing jobs \"are just not going to come back,\" he warned -- after six months when they\\'d fallen by 31,000 under his policies.\\n\\nA month after Election Day 2016, Paul Krugman wrote of factory work: \"Nothing policy can do will bring back those lost jobs. The service sector is the future of work; but nobody wants to hear it.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s certainly true that long-term trends favor growth in the service sector over that in manufacturing worldwide -- but that leaves plenty of room for new US factory jobs, as well as service ones.\\n\\nTrump\\'s formula was pretty simple: Ending the Obama-era wave of ever-more regulation, while rolling back many of the most senseless rules, and cutting taxes.\\n\\nPlus two major breaks from recent Democratic and Republican policy.\\n\\nFirst: His trade approach has always been aimed at boosting US employment, especially in manufacturing. Critics note that Trump\\'s tariffs have hurt some US industries while helping others, but not enough to stop the gains noted above. And the tariffs are just a means to the end of fundamentally rewriting trade relations -- the disruptions should end as new trade deals are finalized.\\n\\nSecond: Trump\\'s toughness on illegal immigration is also (in part) about protecting American workers from competitors who\\'d work for less.\\n\\nAs Charles Gasparino noted in Saturday\\'s Post, this last actually has The New York Times bewailing the rise in construction wages because of a labor shortage. The building trades are notorious for employing the \"undocumented\"; now they\\'re feeling a squeeze thanks to Trump.\\n\\nThe Times paints it as \"a terrible burden for wealthy construction companies and contractors,\" Gasparino notes -- when it\\'s a clear win for the US working class.\\n\\nLord knows, there\\'s plenty more to be done. Presidential adviser Ivanka Trump and Chief Economist Kevin Hassett continue to push the private sector to up its job-training game, which is vital to continued employment growth.\\n\\n(Government training programs, sadly, don\\'t deliver the same payoffs.)\\n\\nEven the president\\'s push for criminal-justice reform plays a role here: People leaving prison need work, and this economy needs the workers. It\\'s all about making American society healthier.\\n\\nBottom line: Trump has been pursuing a clear, coherent vision from the start, one his opponents insisted couldn\\'t work -- and it\\'s doing exactly what he said it would.', 'source': {'uri': 'nypost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'New York Post'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/trump-magic-jobs-wand.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 863}\n",

Serrano, Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr. Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report. Mr. Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters, nor seen them in advance, though he gave Mr. Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation\\'s main findings.\\n\\n\"The letter of the 24th, Mr. Mueller\\'s team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that,\" Mr. Barr said. \"The letter on the 29th, I don\\'t believe that that was reviewed by Mr. Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter.\"\\n\\nLater, Representative Nina M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress.

His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr. Mueller said.\\n\\nDemocrats press Barr on Mueller.\\n\\nDemocrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr. Barr on Tuesday on what one called \"the elephant in the room\": his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel\\'s report.\\n\\n\"The American people have been left with many unanswered questions; serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report,\" Mr. Serrano said in his opening remarks.\\n\\n\"I think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen,\" he added.\\n\\nDemocrats have criticized Mr. Barr\\'s decision to share Mr. Mueller\\'s top-line findings in a four-page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr. Trump had not committed an obstruction-of-justice offense after Mr. Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment. They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr. Mueller\\'s investigators have complained that Mr. Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, they had their first chance to level criticism in person.\\n\\nMs. Lowey called Mr. Barr\\'s handling of the Mueller report \"unacceptable\" and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter.\\n\\n\"Even for someone who has done this job before,\" she said, referring to Mr. Barr\\'s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s, \"I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.\"\\n\\nMr. Barr has insisted that he is being as transparent as he can be and that he wrote the letter to share the main investigative findings with the public as soon as possible while he and other law enforcement officials review the full report. He has vowed to give copies to Congress by mid-April, after lawyers from the special counsel\\'s office and the Justice Department have had time to redact classified materials, secret grand jury testimony and information related to open investigations.\\n\\n[Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report.]\\n\\nBarr tries to keep the sparks to a minimum.\\n\\nMr. Barr did not address the Mueller report during his opening statement, and he made clear that he did not intend to generate any big headlines.

Now She Plans to Publish.', 'body': 'Earlier this year, Amélie Wen Zhao\\'s literary career almost imploded before it had even begun.\\n\\nHer debut novel, \"Blood Heir,\" was six months away from publication, but it was already getting pummeled. The controversy started in January, when some readers argued that Zhao\\'s depiction of slavery was racially insensitive. It quickly snowballed into an online pile-on, as some commenters who hadn\\'t read the young adult fantasy book expressed outrage about its contents.\\n\\nZhao was stunned. \"There were so many voices chiming in, and only a few people had read the book,\" she said in a recent interview at her publisher\\'s office.\\n\\nOverwhelmed by the criticism, she told her publishers to cancel the novel\\'s June release.\\n\\n[ Keira Drake and Jonah Winter, two authors who faced criticism on social media for their books, talk about how they responded. ]\\n\\nAfterward, Zhao, who is 26, agonized over her decision. She kept herself occupied at her day job as a portfolio manager at an international bank. Then she collected herself and reread her book several times, examining the plot and characters to see if the critics were right.\\n\\nShe decided they weren\\'t. In March, Zhao called her editor at Delacorte Press and told her that she wanted to move forward with the novel after all. She made some revisions, and \"Blood Heir\" is now scheduled to be released in November.\\n\\n\"Ultimately, it\\'s true to my vision,\" she said.\\n\\nZhao\\'s decision to move ahead with publication will likely reignite the fractious, ongoing debate about diversity, representation and \"cancel culture\" in the young adult literary world. While some see the discussion about cultural appropriation in fiction as a necessary, if painful, step toward addressing the lack of diversity in publishing, others argue that the online Y.A. community has become too cutthroat, even intolerant, in its attacks on first-time authors who tackle challenging social issues or write outside their immediate cultural experience.\\n\\nWhen the controversy over \"Blood Heir\" erupted, battle lines were quickly drawn within the close-knit children\\'s publishing community. A small but influential group of authors argued that the novel dealt insensitively with race and the legacy of slavery, and was an affront to nonwhite communities. The book\\'s cancellation then prompted an equally passionate backlash to the backlash from a camp that rallied to Zhao\\'s defense, arguing that the novel\\'s critics, who claimed to be championing diversity, had bullied a young Asian woman into silence. \"How a Twitter Mob Derailed an Immigrant Female Author\\'s Budding Career\" read one headline in Tablet magazine. Other people faulted the author herself for caving to pressure.\\n\\nZhao is of course not the first -- or even the most recent -- Y.A. novelist to be buried under an avalanche of criticism before her book even came out. Keira Drake\\'s fantasy novel, \"The Continent,\" was delayed by her publisher and rewritten after readers blasted it as \"racist trash\" and \"offensive\" in early reviews. In 2017, Laurie Forest was bombarded with hundreds of negative reviews on Goodreads by readers who claimed her debut fantasy novel, \"The Black Witch,\" was bigoted, months before the book\\'s release. And in February, Kosoko Jackson pulled his young adult debut novel, \"A Place for Wolves,\" a story set in the 1990s during the Kosovo war that features two gay American teenagers. Jackson decided to cancel the publication after a firestorm erupted on social media over his decision to set the story against the backdrop of genocide, and to make the story\\'s villain an Albanian Muslim. \"I apologize to those I hurt with my novel,\" he wrote in a statement.\\n\\nThe blowup over \"A Place for Wolves,\" which was scheduled to be published in March by Sourcebooks Fire, was particularly fraught, because Jackson, a young gay black man, works as a sensitivity reader, or an expert who helps authors and publishers vet books for potentially problematic content and stereotypes. Jackson was also part of the chorus of voices denouncing \"Blood Heir,\" an ironic twist that was seized upon by observers who claim the movement to police potential cultural appropriation in literature has gone too far.\\n\\n\"From the outside, this is starting to look like a conversation focused less on literature than obedience,\" Ruth Graham wrote in an article on Slate about Jackson\\'s novel.\\n\\nWhile there are often controversies simmering in the young adult literary world, the magnitude and speed at which the backlash builds seems to have accelerated, often amplified by social media.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a platform where outrage travels quickly and often out of context,\" said Kat Rosenfield, a pop-culture writer and young adult novelist. \"It\\'s possible that some of the successful campaigns to either pull books or edit books have emboldened people to feel like initiating some of these complaints on Twitter can lead to some concrete action.\"\\n\\nAs a result, authors and publishers have grown increasingly wary of stepping into cultural minefields. Many are turning to sensitivity readers to help them identify potential cultural pitfalls before publication. Still, some free speech advocacy groups worry that the environment has gotten so heated that it could lead to self-censorship.\\n\\n\"What is worrying to us is the chilling effect,\" said Svetlana Mintcheva, the director of programs at the National Coalition Against Censorship, an advocacy organization that is developing a support network for young adult authors who face pressure to call off their books. \"If you\\'re a white author, would you want to have a minority character?\"\\n\\nOf course, critiquing a work of literature is by no means equivalent to censorship. Many who advocate for more diversity in children\\'s publishing note that the problem isn\\'t authors who write outside their own cultural backgrounds, but those who do it badly, in a way that perpetuates stereotypes.\\n\\n\"If we\\'re going to push for diversity and push for representation in YA literature, then it should be done right,\" said Ricci Yuhico, the managing librarian for young adult services at the Mid-Manhattan Library in New York. \"We want to make sure our teen patrons have good books to turn to when they ask for stories that represent them and can broaden their worldview.\"\\n\\nZhao was surprised to find herself in social media\\'s cross hairs. Born in Paris and raised in Beijing, Zhao had been writing fiction since she was in grade school but never imagined she could make a living from it. She studied economics at U.C.L.A. and New York University, and found a job in finance in the United States when she graduated.\\n\\nShe came up with the plot for \"Blood Heir\" in 2014, during a family trip to Russia. She imagined a fictional empire where a group of people called Affinites, who have special powers, are feared and trafficked for labor by the powerful elite -- a system that is challenged by a fugitive princess who wields magic. In describing the plight of Affinites, Zhao aimed to invoke real-world issues, including human trafficking and indentured servitude in Asia.\\n\\n\"What I sought to interrogate and critique was the modern-day epidemic of human trafficking and endured labor,\" Zhao said. \"It wasn\\'t something I had seen in Y.A. literature.\"\\n\\nShe also drew on her own experience as an immigrant and her feeling of being powerless and not belonging, she said.\\n\\nAfter Delacorte sent out advance reader copies of the novel to reviewers, librarians and booksellers, many of the early responses were positive. But those were soon drowned out by blistering critiques. \"This book is about slavery, a false oppression narrative that equates having legitimately dangerous magical powers that kill people with being an oppressed minority, like a person of color,\" a reader wrote on Goodreads.\\n\\nA social media conflagration ensued. Within days, Zhao issued an apology on Facebook, announcing that she had asked her publisher not to release the book. For a young debut author, it felt like a fatal blow to her career.\\n\\n\"I was really caught off guard,\" she said. \"It was very devastating to me that the book was read in a totally different cultural context.\"\\n\\nHer editor, Krista Marino, was similarly taken aback. \"We had had many readers at that point and hadn\\'t received any such feedback,\" she said. Still, Delacorte said they would support her decision to withdraw the book or move ahead with the release.\\n\\nAfter Zhao decided she wanted to release the book, she and her publisher sought feedback from scholars and sensitivity readers in an effort to resolve any ambiguity around the type of indentured labor depicted. They had academics from different multicultural backgrounds, as well as one who studies human trafficking in Asia, evaluate the text, and Zhao added new material and made changes based on their comments. They had additional sensitivity readers vet the book for racial and other stereotypes.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear whether such efforts will mollify Zhao\\'s critics, or if the release of \"Blood Heir\" this fall will ignite another cycle of outrage -- a backlash to the backlash to the backlash. There\\'s also the risk that the controversy will dampen enthusiasm for the book among readers and booksellers.\\n\\nBut Zhao and her publisher seem more excited than wary that readers will have a chance to evaluate the book for themselves.\\n\\n\"We ultimately think our Y.A. readers are very smart,\" Marino said. \"They can read what they want to read and use their critical thinking skills to work through it.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'alexandra_alter@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Alexandra Alter', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/29/books/review/29bloodheir/29bloodheir-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2784313725490196, 'wgt': 849}\n",

The law prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, among other things.\\n\\nThe federal complaint is the latest escalation in an almost yearlong dispute between Amazon and East African workers in the area, which has one of the most organized groups of Amazon warehouse employees in the country.\\n\\n\"We think an E.E.O.C. investigation is a key part of starting the process of holding Amazon accountable,\" said Nimra Azmi, a lawyer on the case.\\n\\nAn Amazon spokeswoman, Brenda Alfred, said in a statement, \"Diversity and inclusion is central to our business and company culture, and associates can pray whenever they choose.\" However, she said, \"We respect the privacy of employees and don\\'t discuss complaints publicly.\"\\n\\nIn 2016, when Amazon opened a major fulfillment center in Shakopee, a suburb of Minneapolis, it recruited heavily from the region\\'s large immigrant population amid low unemployment. At one point it ran buses to the warehouse from a Minneapolis neighborhood known as Little Mogadishu.\\n\\nFor more than a year, the Awood Center, a nonprofit focused on helping East African workers, has organized the employees around their concerns about the pace of work, accommodations for prayers and what they see as little opportunity for advancement to management. Awood has received funding from grants as well as the Service Employees International Union.\\n\\nThrough a series of escalating actions last year, they became the first known group of workers in the United States to get Amazon management to negotiate. In December, a group protested outside one of the area\\'s mammoth warehouses. Local press reports estimated that 100 people had attended. And in March, a smaller group walked out on its shift for several hours.\\n\\n[Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]\\n\\nMuslim Advocates said it had been in touch with Awood since last summer to determine whether there was a legal challenge to raise.\\n\\nIn the letter summarizing their claims, the women said they had faced retaliation since they were involved in the December protest. The workers said they had received difficult work assignments and improper warnings that could lead to firing. Amazon also had a \"culture of surveillance after the protest,\" Ms. Azmi said.\\n\\nMuslim Advocates has withheld the women\\'s names from the public, saying they fear further retaliation. One of the women agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nIn the interview, the worker said that she had seen her manager looking at social media of the protests, and that he had then commented he noticed she had participated. Another time, a different manager took a photograph of her on his personal phone while she was working, she said, adding that when she complained, management played down her concerns.\\n\\nAccording to the letter, one of the other women \"has had her everyday conversations repeatedly video recorded by her supervisors.\"\\n\\n\"There is zero tolerance for retaliation in the workplace,\" Ms. Alfred, the Amazon spokeswoman, said. \"We take any reports of retaliation seriously and look into all claims made by our employees.\"\\n\\nAmazon gives the workers paid breaks to pray up to 20 minutes, as required by state law, but the employees are still responsible for maintaining the same \"rate,\" or how many items they must pack in an hour. Ms. Alfred said workers could take longer prayer breaks without pay, for which productivity expectations would be adjusted.\\n\\nMissing the rate can lead to write-ups and firing. The women said they and other Muslim workers feared taking time to pray, making it a \"hostile environment\" to be Muslim.\\n\\nMs. Alfred said the company had worked hard to accommodate the annual observance of Ramadan, when many Muslims fast during the day. Amazon consulted Muslim employees and trained managers on the holiday as well as on safety for fasting workers. Employees can trade shifts to work at night, and they held a potluck at the start of the holiday.\\n\\nThe workers say the pressure to produce is consuming.

Last quarter, the company spent 4 percent less fulfilling orders than a year earlier, even as the number of units sold was up 10 percent.\\n\\nBrian Olsavsky, Amazon\\'s finance chief, told investors that was largely because Amazon hired fewer workers as it added fewer warehouses than in recent years.\\n\\n\"Right now, we are on a nice path where we are getting the most of out of the capacity we have,\" he said.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'karen_weise@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Karen Weise', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/business/08amazon1/08amazon1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4772278', 'sentiment': -0.04313725490196074, 'wgt': 745}\n",

Asked about the contract renewal by the New York Times, a Palantir spokesperson stated:\\n\\n\"There are two major divisions of ICE with two distinct mandates: Homeland Security Investigations, or H.S.I., is responsible for cross-border criminal investigations. The other major directorate, Enforcement and Removal Operations, or E.R.O., is responsible for interior civil immigration enforcement, including deportation and detention of undocumented immigrants. We do not work for E.R.O.\"\\n\\nDocuments obtained through Freedom of Information Act litigation and provided to The Intercept show that this claim, that Palantir software is strictly involved in criminal investigations as opposed to deportations, is false. The discrepancy between the private intelligence firm\\'s public assertion, and the reality conveyed in the newly-released documents, was first identified by Mijente, an advocacy organization that has closely tracked Palantir\\'s murky role in immigration enforcement. Far from detached support in \"cross-border criminal investigations,\" the materials released this week confirm the role Palantir technology played in facilitating hundreds of arrests, only a small fraction of which led to criminal prosecutions.\\n\\nA May 2017 ICE document on an impending \"Unaccompanied Alien Children Human Smuggling Disruption Initiative,\" characterized as \"a joint effort of ERO and HSI,\" makes explicit the fact that ERO used Palantir\\'s Investigative Case Management software to target the parents and other relatives of unaccompanied minors crossing the border, a precursor to the Trump administration\\'s family separation policy. In a section on \"Coordinating Instructions,\" the operational document describes how \"the 26 HSI special agents in charge (SAC) will coordinate with their respective 24 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) field office directors (POD) to establish teams of HSI special agents and ERO deportation officers, with the support of the local HSI SAC intelligence program.\" The instructions go on to state that \"Each SAC will be responsible for determining how to document each UAC arrival in the Investigative Case Management (ICM) system; however, it is recommended that every initial UAC encounter at the border or its functional equivalent be documented.\"\\n\\nAs the Intercept reported in 2017, \"ICM allows ICE agents to access a vast \\'ecosystem\\' of data to facilitate immigration officials in both discovering targets and then creating and administering cases against them,\" and provides ICE with \"access to intelligence platforms maintained by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and an array of other federal and private law enforcement entities.\"\\n\\nThe document makes clear that the operation would directly target the parents and other family members of children apprehended at the border-all with the help of Palantir\\'s case management app. The document continues to instruct that if \"sufficient information on parents or family members is obtained\" while investigating an unaccompanied child, \"a collateral case will be sent via ICM to the affected AOR\\'s team for action.\" The instructions make clear that ICM-enabled inquires could result in charges against a child\\'s family: \"Teams will be available to immediately conduct database checks and contact suspected sponsor /parent or family members to identify, interview, and, if applicable, seek charges against the individual(s) and administratively arrest the subjects and anybody encountered during the inquiry who is out of status.\"\\n\\nThe Palantir-aided campaign to hunt down and arrest family members of children who crossed the border alone was touted by the Trump administration\\'s top immigration hardliners as a necessary measure to deter asylum seekers from making the journey north. According to figures ICE provided The Intercept on Monday, the 2017 initiative led to 443 arrests, including 35 criminal arrests. Prosecutions, however, were more difficult to come by, with ICE acknowledging that the campaign led to just 38 prosecutions related to \"alien smuggling\" or \"re-entry of removed aliens.\"\\n\\nIn a letter to the top oversight officials at DHS in December 2017, a coalition of immigrant rights organization described the so-called \"surge initiative\" as unconstitutional, and said federal law enforcement was \"using children as bait.\"\\n\\nThe documents detailing the enforcement campaign were first obtained by the American Immigration Council -- in collaboration with the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, the National Immigrant Justice Center, Kids in Need of Defense, Women\\'s Refugee Commission, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP -- as part of ongoing freedom of information litigation surrounding the Trump administration\\'s family separation policy.\\n\\n\"The detention and deportation machine is not only driven by hate, but also by profit,\" Jesse Franzblau, Senior Policy Analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center, said in an email to The Intercept. \"Palantir profits from its contract with ICE to help the administration target parents and sponsors of children, and also pays Amazon to use its servers in the process. The role of private tech behind immigration enforcement deserves more attention, particularly with the growing influence of Silicon Valley in government policymaking\"\\n\\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp has previously expressed reservations his company\\'s role in governmental overreach, despite federal contracts serving as some of the firm\\'s highest profile business. \"I didn\\'t sign up for the government to know when I smoke a joint or have an affair,\" he told Forbes in a 2013 interview.

It\\'s an unlikely possibility, but Basaldú said he personally is ready to die stopping the wall -- or tearing it down. Unlike other places in Hidalgo County, including a butterfly center and a historic Catholic chapel, the cemetery on which the camp stands was not exempted from construction by a February border wall funding bill signed by President Donald Trump.\\n\\nCongress has already sent nearly $3 billion to Trump for a border barrier, including up to 37 miles in Hidalgo and Starr counties. Almost half of that, $1.34 billion, was allocated for the Rio Grande Valley, the compromise outcome of the longest government shutdown in history. Trump then declared a national emergency in February, giving him the power to direct $6.1 billion more from other federal agencies for the wall (though over a dozen state attorneys general are challenging the executive order in court). In March, the government submitted notices of condemnation for hundreds of mostly Hispanic landowners in the valley whose property it wants for the wall.\\n\\nEarlier in the evening, Basaldú and I sat with two other Valleyites downhill from the earthen levee where the border wall is slated for construction. A Border Patrol agent slowly cruised by, glaring down at us. Under CBP\\'s plan, the campsite and the cemetery would be stranded in a no man\\'s land behind the wall, and would be damaged by an enforcement zone resembling a permanent military outpost with a utility road, sensors and cameras, bright lights, and frequent patrols. The agency wants to build 772 total miles of barrier along the border, which it estimates would cost $18 billion.\\n\\nLast year, Hinojosa started working with other local activists to hone anti-wall messaging and convened groups of people to make banners for protests along the wall\\'s proposed path. She sees this work as part of a growing movement to repel powerful interests encroaching on the valley. Since 2015, she\\'s also organized to prevent liquified natural gas companies from building a complex of export terminals where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\n\"The LNG fight and border wall fight are very connected,\" Hinojosa explained. \"Families and friends are going to hearings to stop LNG, they\\'re organizing to stop the border wall, it\\'s all part of the same system impacting our region.\"\\n\\nFor now, the coalition organizing against the wall is small, especially relative to the full power of the federal government. Much more widespread is a sense that the wall perpetuates a legacy of class and racial subjugation in the valley. Patricia Rubio, an outdoorswoman who sleeps at the camp at least once a week, acknowledged that being from the valley often means carrying several generations\\' worth of loss and even shame.\\n\\nHer aunts and uncles were migrant fieldworkers and \"grew up with low self-esteem and fear to express themselves\" in Spanish, said Rubio, also an adopted Carrizo/Comecrudo tribal member. \"I grew up hearing stories about beatings or lynchings. Those stories need to stay alive and we can\\'t be ashamed of them.\" She feels a sense of responsibility to confront the types of powerful interests that immiserated her ancestors.\\n\\nThe wall\\'s construction fits into a longer legacy of the valley as a sacrifice zone, which started when Spanish colonists arrived in the 18th century and continued after the U.S. government relegated Mexicans here to second-class American citizenship. Yet for all the suffering the wall is causing locals who feel unheard, for some it\\'s also producing a sense of groundedness once lost to the dislocations of history.\\n\\nThe notice in the local newspaper taken out by the U.S. Southern District of Texas is 24 pages long and addressed to nearly 300 parties \"whose whereabouts cannot be determined or who could not be personally served.\" The message for all of them is the same: The government will seize their land \"to construct, install, operate, and maintain roads, fencing, vehicle barriers, security lighting, and related structures,\" mostly as part of 8 to 12 miles of barrier in Starr County.\\n\\nIt\\'s the second time the notice has been published in the newspaper; after the third time, defendants will only have 20 days to respond before the government begins taking their property.\\n\\nEfrén Olivares, a lawyer with the Texas Civil Rights Project, has been advising low-income landowners as the state pursues their land. He\\'s been in talks with a dozen people interested in litigation and said a nationwide network of pro bono lawyers is preparing to take on more cases.\\n\\n\"These are going to be long, drawn-out battles,\" Olivares said. \"Eminent domain law is very, very favorable to the government, but even within that, we\\'re hoping to make sure the government goes through hoops to get the land.\"\\n\\nEarlier, Olivares led a bilingual information session in Roma, a stone\\'s throw away from Mexico. Olivares explained to a packed room that while federal agents can legally be on private property to patrol for migrants, landowners can charge a fee for surveyors and contractors to be on their land. Some appeared frustrated at these nuances. One man, who did not want to give his name, realized that he\\'d given surveyors permission to be on his land for 18 months without receiving compensation.\\n\\nMaria Luisa Cavazos\\'s land is in the government\\'s crosshairs. A retired nurse who now lives in McAllen, Cavazos is one of dozens of owners of a 15-acre strip of land in Los Ebanos, a tiny community in Hidalgo County that has been coiled around the river since the 19th century. The land was left to the estate of her late grandmother, Maria Dolores Peña de Flores, and now the feds want 1.2 acres of it to build a road easement through the property.\\n\\nCavazos, now an elderly woman, said her family stopped farming the land over 40 years ago, after her father and uncle were hired to pick crops for major agribusinesses. It was fertile, supporting crops like cantaloupes, squash, cotton, and corn. It\\'s since been mostly vacant, and the federal government began sending letters out to Flores\\'s descendants in December 2016 asking that they accept a total of $2,900 for the land and waive future appeals. The offer would come out to about $50 of compensation for each descendant.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost certainly a low-ball offer. An investigation by ProPublica and the Texas Tribune found that the federal government routinely skirted regulations when it paid South Texas landowners during the last round of fence-building under the Bush and Obama administrations. Appraisers for the Army Corps of Engineers were not beholden to certain federal regulations requiring they offer an amount that reflected the land\\'s true value, including its irrigable and farming capacity. Back then, Cavazos sold a different tract of land to the Department of Homeland Security for just $300. To get more money this time around, she would have to hire a lawyer to do her own independent appraisal, but she\\'s overwhelmed at the prospect.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe they should take away that land,\" Cavazos said on her driveway, her eyes welling with tears as she recounted memories. \"When I lived there when I was young, the illegals would knock on your door and ask for food, and if we had leftover food for our supper, my mom would give it to them.\"\\n\\nCavazos\\'s cousin Mirta Trigo also lived in Los Ebanos as a child. Trigo said some of her family members still use the land for Easter celebrations, and she\\'s more resistant than her relatives about the government\\'s bid for it. When she received the letter asking her to voluntarily forfeit the property, she didn\\'t sign it. But she doesn\\'t have the money to hire a lawyer and isn\\'t expecting to get much more from the federal government.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want the wall there, the land is part of us,\" Trigo said. \"The government doesn\\'t care what we think, it\\'s true they don\\'t listen to us porque we\\'re the Mexican people, we\\'re Mexicans.\"\\n\\nBoth Trigo and Cavazos were born in the U.S., but their self-recognition as Mexican speaks to a collective cultural identity that held strong for a century after the Rio Grande Valley became a territory of the U.S. After the 1840s, through a sustained effort spanning decades, Anglo settlers in the valley gained power as bankers, merchants, teachers, and other roles with local influence. \"Mexicans,\" or Tejanos, were relegated to roles like artisans, laborers, and struggling ranchers.\\n\\nStarting in the late 19th century, Mexicans who had inherited property through Spanish land grants saw their acreage claims dwindle as they were divided among descendants. Ranchers were dispossessed of their lands by white brokers unwilling to lend them capital, as well as through theft and fraud. Lynch mobs, police, and Texas Rangers later maintained wealth and property lines through brutal violence. A racialized underclass of fieldworkers, enlarged by refugees fleeing the Mexican Revolution, became the underpinning of an Anglo-dominated agricultural economy.\\n\\n\"All the vestiges of your culture, you start to perceive them as being bad, the food, the language, the clothing, the values,\" Ramírez said of his upbringing, as he stood inside the endangered historic chapel built by his ancestor Martin Jackson. \"We thought we could progress and be in the melting pot, but we couldn\\'t change the way we looked.\"\\n\\nHaving visibly dark skin, or other physical features associated with Indigenous American or African ancestry, can make U.S. citizens in the Rio Grande Valley targets for harassment by border officials. Max Muñoz, the director of operations at the National Butterfly Center in Mission, is an American-born citizen who has been profiled and chased by Border Patrol agents half a dozen times over the last two years. The center, a nature preserve with more than 250 species of butterfly and other wildlife that may be cleaved by the border wall despite congressional protections, has become a nucleus of resistance against its construction.\\n\\nOnce, an agent stopped Muñoz\\'s truck and demanded to see identification for his two daughters, who were small children. A helicopter was called after Muñoz refused to comply. Another time, an agent warned Muñoz that he was going to \"find\" and \"catch\" him in the future. He has stopped taking his family to the center for recreation, opting for nature trips to Austin instead -- six hours away.\\n\\n\"I know I shouldn\\'t, but I don\\'t want to expose my kids to that,\" Muñoz said. \"I try not to put racism in their minds, but they see I\\'m getting stopped. I say [to them], maybe it\\'s because there\\'s an order to intimidate people away from the river.\"\\n\\nThe history of powerful forces uprooting people in the valley stretches back centuries. Conquistadors raided Native communities and enslaved whole families, and later the Spanish empire brought them to Catholic missions to eradicate their tribal identities. Colonization disrupted foodways and brought fatal diseases, increasing some Indigenous peoples\\' dependence on the church\\'s abusive authority. The life-giving lands along the Rio Grande delta once supported at least 31 separate tribes in South Texas and Northeastern Mexico. There\\'s almost no public memory in the valley of most of them now.\\n\\nJuan Mancias, the chairman of the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe of Texas, who has taken a lead in organizing against the wall, told The Intercept that his grandfather helped him keep his connection to South Texas alive. The Carrizos and Comecrudos, names given by the Spanish, were each comprised of two bands in the valley. There\\'s nothing in settler historical archives after 1825 about the Carrizos as a distinct group, and the last known fluent speakers of the Comecrudean language were recorded near Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, in 1886.\\n\\nMancias, 64, grew up in the Texas panhandle after his ancestors moved there for work. He believes many in the valley have Carrizo and Comecrudo heritage, but after centuries of cultural genocide by the Catholic church and two settler nations, there\\'s little way to confirm it except oral history that isn\\'t extensively recorded. \"It would have been lost for me if I hadn\\'t asked my grandfather what was really happening, or my older cousins and aunts and uncles, or my mom, who is 94,\" Mancias said.\\n\\nWithout a land base, the tribe has had to ally with property owners in the wall\\'s path. In January, Mancias started connecting with the Butterfly Center, Ramiro Ramírez of the Eli Jackson Cemetery, and Fred Cavazos (no relation to Maria), owner of 77 riverside acres in Madero, who has been featured in The Intercept, the Washington Post, and The Atlantic. With the Ramírez family\\'s permission, the Carrizo/Comecrudo have occupied the Eli Jackson Cemetery and more recently started an encampment at the Butterfly Center; Cavazos said that Mancias has a key to his property to set up a possible third resistance camp in the future.', 'source': {'uri': 'theintercept.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Intercept'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'aaron_miguel_cantu@theintercept.com', 'name': 'Aaron Miguel Cantú', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/03/border-encampment-1553809866-e1553809923905.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2156862745098039, 'wgt': 720}\n",

The fact is, Beto O\\'Rourke has recently embraced the extreme left. In the months since failing to oust Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, O\\'Rourke has laid the groundwork for a progressive campaign, most visible in his new positions on energy and the border.\\n\\nOne might mistake Beto as an ally of the energy industry. Texas politicians are generally pro-energy, since the state\\'s booming economy is largely fueled by oil and gas, and Beto\\'s fundraising numbers suggest he is no exception. He has raised over $467,000 from oil and gas and was \"the second-biggest recipient\" of their money during 2018.\\n\\nWHY BETO O\\'ROURKE COULD BE DEMS\\' 2020 NOMINEE AGAINST TRUMP\\n\\nBut sensing how far left the Democratic base has moved, Beto is now embracing the Green New Deal. In January he declared he is \"supportive of the concept\" of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\\'s, D-N.Y., plan. By February, he doubled down and called the Green New Deal the \"best proposal\" he has seen, adding he is \"really excited\" by the plan to socialize our economy and decimate our energy industry.\\n\\n(Keep in mind, with its $93 trillion price tag, the plan is so extreme that even liberals like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg oppose it.)\\n\\nBy embracing the Green New Deal, Beto proved he cares more about appealing to the far-left than about backing reasonable public policy. This makes perfect political sense: bandwagon the enthusiasm of the growing socialist base as part of a 2020 campaign strategy. But does it make sense for his home state of Texas and their millions of energy workers?\\n\\nTexas is reaping massive economic rewards from the state\\'s Permian Basin region. Shale production from Texas is surging with a recent report noting that Texas\\' oil production is shattering records, creating 26,000 oil and gas industry jobs in just the past year at an average salary of over $130,000.\\n\\nThe Green New Deal would end this boom and undermine the Texas economy. Beto O\\'Rourke seems to be OK with that. Texans should be alarmed.\\n\\n[O]ne thing is clear - Beto O\\'Rourke is no longer a moderate Democrat. If he\\'s become a radical liberal in just a few weeks, all of Texas - and America - should watch and see who he becomes during the course of the campaign.\\n\\nIt\\'s not just his energy policy that\\'s moved far to the left. On immigration, Beto has staked out perhaps the furthest-left position of any presidential candidate. In February, he announced that he would like to tear down the existing border barriers we have with Mexico, telling an MSNBC host, \"Yes, absolutely...I\\'d take the wall down.\"\\n\\nThat position might be popular in San Francisco, but Texans would cringe. Not even Hillary Clinton wants to tear down the existing barriers that our Border Patrol agents utilize to keep America safe and combat illegal immigration.\\n\\nPerhaps Beto is trying to bluster his way into the left\\'s heart by backing whatever wacky left-wing idea he can think of, no matter how inauthentic it makes him look. After all, he has few legislative accomplishments to show for his time in Congress.\\n\\nIn that way, he\\'s similar to much of the Democratic field, including Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker - a lot of talk, but few accomplishments. And we\\'ve already seen what happens to our nation when we elect a president based on rhetoric. Just look at the Obama years.\\n\\nMaybe Beto knows he cannot win the nomination but is auditioning for the vice presidential slot. Texas was closer than expected in the presidential election of 2016, and Beto showed tremendous fundraising prowess and appeal in his 2018 Senate bid. Democrats have longed to turn Texas blue, and O\\'Rourke might believe his star power could help flip the state.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBut the sudden leftward lunge is a surprise. Did Beto intentionally keep his radical beliefs hidden during his campaign against Cruz? Did the media, too busy gushing about Beto\\'s skateboarding and punk rock band, ever question his liberal views and ask how they gel with conservative Texas?\\n\\nOdds are that Beto, excited to get back on the campaign trail, suddenly adopted new beliefs because that\\'s what the polls told him to do. Time will tell whether this finger-in-the-air strategy reaps any rewards, but one thing is clear - Beto O\\'Rourke is no longer a moderate Democrat.

After decades of warning that a united country would resurrect the horrors of the 20th century, its neighbors and allies, many of them former battlefield foes, came around to accept and even welcome it. That\\'s in large part because, during those same decades, West Germany had undertaken a self-administered \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung,\" a mouthful of a German word that translates as something like \"the overcoming of the past,\" and refers to the country\\'s collective effort to grapple with the causes and legacies of the Nazi era.\\n\\nIt was a painful, halting process, but it helped transform Germany from pariah state to the moral leader of continental Europe. In recent years, though, the achievements of the postwar era have come under scrutiny. \"Our culture of remembrance is crumbling,\" Germany\\'s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said recently.\\n\\nThe most damning evidence is the hard-right Alternative for Germany party, which surged into the Bundestag in 2017; in parts of eastern Germany it is the most popular party. The AfD is riding a shocking rise of German anti-Semitism and xenophobia. Forty percent of Germans say it\\'s right to blame Jews for Israel\\'s policies in the Middle East. In my neighborhood in Berlin, and others across the country, people wearing Jewish headgear are harassed on the street. And in the aftermath of the refugee crisis of 2015-16, many Germans -- including mainstream, middle-class citizens -- embraced the far right\\'s premises. In surveys, ever more say they desire an authoritarian leader and distrust liberal democracy.\\n\\nThe AfD gives cover to expanded expressions of intolerance and hate. In the Bundestag, the party\\'s members speak about foreigners, the Holocaust and Muslims in a way that a decade ago would have triggered a full-blown scandal -- but that today is commonplace. They downplay the significance of the Nazi era, and demean efforts to reconcile with the past, like the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Popular TV shows and best sellers set in the Nazi era treat Germans as victims, not perpetrators. At the same time, 40 percent of young Germans say they know very little or nothing about the Holocaust.\\n\\n\"We were so sure that we\\'d learned our lesson, and what is not allowed cannot happen. We thought serious anti-Semitism was the past,\" said Andreas Eberhardt, director of Remembrance, Responsibility and Future, a Berlin-based foundation concerned with historical remembrance. \"But now we\\'re rethinking things.\"\\n\\nWhat went wrong?\\n\\nThere\\'s no question that Germany\\'s efforts to overcome its past were sincere and largely effective. But they also came with their own blind spots.\\n\\nOne was the assumption that Germany\\'s treatment of the past was as thorough as many believed. New research shows that far fewer Nazis were brought to justice in the immediate postwar years than previously thought. Indeed, just as the \\'60s-era students charged, former Nazis occupied many positions of authority -- as teachers, judges, media professionals and even politicians -- for many decades after the war, transmitting their values with them.\\n\\nAnd while the Germans laudably focused on the country\\'s anti-Semitic legacy, they overlooked other aspects of the Nazis\\' genocidal racism, like its anti-Slavism, the genocide of Roma and the incarceration of homosexuals in concentration camps. Until recently, Germans paid scant attention to their country\\'s first genocidal campaign, in colonial-era southwestern Africa, which bolstered the racist foundations for Nazi ideology. Such selective moral reckoning left room for racism to fester.\\n\\nNor did Germany ever eradicate deep-seated prejudices toward outsiders. Even as it brought in millions of guestworkers from Turkey in the 1960s, it long resisted integrating them, let alone opening its culture to include non-ethnic Germans. Germany praised itself for facing its Nazi past, but it practiced widespread discrimination against immigrants. \"The clash over the Merkel government\\'s refugee policy,\" argued German historian Norbert Frei, referring to the protests and xenophobic outbursts following the summer 2015 influx of refugees, \"was simply a welcome occasion to revitalize national-conservative and völkisch thinking that had been socially suppressed over decades but had never disappeared.\"\\n\\nThen there\\'s the split history of East and West Germany. East German Communists proceeded more rigorously in their postwar purging of Nazis, and its leaders too quickly proclaimed that they had eradicated all vestiges of fascism in its territory. They told East Germans that they were the anti-fascist victors -- guilty of nothing -- and that West Germany, a caldron of old Nazis, was just a scaled-back version of the Third Reich. And the East, despite its own, smaller influx of foreign workers (mostly from fellow Communist countries like Vietnam), did an even worse job of promoting diversity and ethnic tolerance.\\n\\nIronically, the fall of Communism and the terms of reunification made all of this worse. Even as Germany was winning praise as a model cosmopolitan society, it was struggling to incorporate millions of former citizens of a fallen dictatorship. Thirty years later, the former East Germany is a hotbed of xenophobia and the far right.\\n\\nThe passing of time doesn\\'t help, either. Today, millions of Germans were not even born when East Germany fell; to them, the Nazi era feels like ancient history. They struggle to see why they should identify Hitler\\'s barbarism with their lives. With the World War II generation mostly gone, the school lessons on the Holocaust and Nazism are taught secondhand, the tone often pedantic and their rituals rote.\\n\\nAdd to this mix the trauma and indignity that many eastern Germans experienced as westerners took over their culture and economy, the disorienting effects of globalization, and the resentment stemming from the ever-wider discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots in Germany, and it\\'s hardly surprising that Germany is facing what was once thought impossible: not a new Nazism per se, but rather a proliferation of hard-right movements and clusters, the latter even found in police and army units, and a new tolerance for racist ideas and violent hooliganism.\\n\\nNone of this is to demean postwar Germany\\'s achievement: As partial as its processing of the past has been, it shaped generations of enlightened, liberal, self-critical citizens. Among its errors, though, was the assumption that history could ever be \"mastered\" and the process wound down. Learning from history, it seems, is an exercise in democracy that can never stop.\\n\\nPaul Hockenos is the author, most recently, of \"Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall, and the Birth of the New Berlin.\"\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\\n\\nHARDEN, Australia -- It\\'s been a year of extremes for this country. The hottest summer ever. Torrential rains in the north. A crippling drought in its southeastern farm belt.\\n\\nNow, with national elections scheduled for May 18, a vital question looms: To what degree will climate change sway the way Australians vote? The answer could provide important lessons for other democracies in the age of climate change.\\n\\nAustralia is acutely vulnerable to climate change, just as it is also a culprit. The continent has warmed faster than the global average; its cherished Great Barrier Reef has been devastated by marine heat waves; and heat and drought this year took a bite out of the country\\'s economy, according to a top official of the country\\'s central bank. At the same time, central to its prosperity is the extraction of the dirtiest fossil fuel: Australia is the world\\'s biggest exporter of coal for power generation.\\n\\nAgainst that backdrop, the governing conservative coalition, led by the Liberal Party, is under pressure in key districts as independents assail longstanding members of Parliament like Tony Abbott, a former Liberal leader and prime minister, over their climate positions.\\n\\nTo understand what it all means, I recently drove through southeastern Australia, the country\\'s most populated area, to speak to voters, both urban and rural, about climate change.\\n\\nIn rural districts, voters who traditionally send conservative lawmakers to Parliament are talking openly about the effects of climate change -- in some instances, even coming out to protest. And, in poll after poll, climate change has climbed the ladder of concerns among the electorate.\\n\\nMore than 60 percent of voters identified climate change as the top \"critical threat\" facing Australia over the next 10 years, while nearly the same share said the government should take steps to address global warming even if that involves \"significant costs,\" according to a poll by the Lowy Institute, an independent research group.\\n\\nAnother poll by Ipsos, a market research firm, found that half of all Australians gave the government \"poor\" marks on managing climate change.\\n\\nMy road trip began in Melbourne, continued on to Sydney and then took me west to the land of Angus cattle and Merino sheep in the vast, parched countryside of New South Wales. On these undulating hills and bare fields, generations of farmers have raised livestock, sown wheat and canola, and elected conservative lawmakers to Parliament. Climate change, for the most part, they used to dismiss as city talk, or just \"rubbish,\" recalled Peter Holding, 64, a third-generation farmer who lives near a hamlet called Harden.\\n\\nThat\\'s changing.\\n\\nThese days, the soil is so dry that a sparse occasional rain shower barely dampens the dirt. Feed prices have skyrocketed. Dams have dried up. Farmers have thinned their stocks.\\n\\nAnd in a country town called Wagga Wagga, where talk of climate change would have been shocking not long ago, more than 200 people showed up to a climate change protest rally in March that Mr. Holding, who is active in a group called Farmers for Climate Action, helped to organize. \"Don\\'t Vote for Fossil Fools,\" read one handmade sign. \"Denial is not a policy,\" read another.\\n\\n\"You would never run a rally like that 10 years ago, but it\\'s become blatantly obvious things are changing,\" Mr. Holding said. \"I don\\'t think we\\'re going to get back to normal.\"\\n\\nIt all worries Guy Milson. A 68-year-old rancher, he has, he said, \"come around\" on climate change. The evidence has become impossible to ignore. The drought has scorched his land. He has had to sharply reduce his herds of cattle and sheep. This blistering summer, even the old, hardy eucalyptus trees roasted in the heat.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve never put so much carbon into the atmosphere,\" Mr. Milson said. \"It can\\'t be normal.\"\\n\\nBut all his life, he has been loyal to the right-of-center Liberal Party. He sees the incumbent energy minister, Angus Taylor, a friend, as a possible future prime minister. And he worries that fear over climate change will punish his party at the polls, especially in swing seats around the country. He is also wary of ditching coal, just now. It is too important to Australia\\'s economy. He says bigger polluters like China should act first.\\n\\nThe average Australian\\'s carbon footprint is slightly lower than that of an American. The country\\'s total emissions have risen to their highest level and it is not on track to meet its Paris climate agreement pledge, according to independent monitors. And a scathing report published recently by a research and advocacy group called the Climate Council said the \"lack of climate change action is the defining leadership failure of the past decade.\"\\n\\nFarther west, I found Edward and Stephanie Gebhardt sitting on their front porch, scanning the skies for rain. The Gebhardts bought a farm just before the latest drought began to set in. Now nearly all their reservoirs were dry. In the muddy slope of one, a thirsty lamb got stuck and died. The fields on which they would normally sow wheat this time of year remained ashen. \"It\\'s almost as if the seasons have shifted,\" said Ms. Gebhardt, 31.\\n\\nNeither of them doubted climate change. Neither had much faith anymore in either of the two conservative parties, the Liberals and their coalition partners, the National Party, that their families had long voted for.\\n\\n\"Honestly I struggle to vote now,\" said Mr. Gebhardt, also 31. \"No one has come out with anything to help us.\"\\n\\nVoting is compulsory in Australia, so Ms. Gebhardt signaled her dissatisfaction in the latest state polls by voting for a gun rights party called Shooters, Fishers and Farmers. It was a \"donkey vote,\" she said, the term used here for a ballot protest.\\n\\nThe energy minister, Mr. Taylor, defended what he called the governing coalition\\'s \"balanced approach\" to gradually reduce emissions in the coming years, while promoting hydropower and investments in solar and wind energy. \"A majority of people want to see action,\" he said. \"They want it to happen at a sensible pace and without substantial costs to them.\"\\n\\nThe Labor Party, the official opposition in Parliament, proposes a faster reduction in emissions and a target of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. But it has steered clear of the idea of a carbon tax, which another Labor government implemented 10 years ago; that Labor government was then ousted by a Liberal Party leader who campaigned on a promise to \"ax the tax.\"\\n\\nThat Liberal Party politician -- Mr. Abbott, who once suggested that Australia pull out of the Paris climate accord but has since changed his position -- is now facing one of the biggest political challenges of his career.\\n\\nOn the way back from ranch country, I stopped by his district, in the suburbs north of Sydney. Neither Mr. Abbott nor his aides responded to requests for an interview.\\n\\nBut one of his main challengers, a lawyer named Zali Steggall who is Australia\\'s only Olympic medalist in Alpine skiing, eagerly explained why she had decided to run for office in an effort to unseat him. \"Tony Abbott has been a massive hand brake on our policies on climate,\" she said.\\n\\nMs. Steggall, an independent who is running for the first time, was speaking on a warm Wednesday evening at the North Curl Curl Surf Club. She sat before a roomful of voters, with a picture-perfect view of the South Pacific behind her. Surfers went in and out of the waves. The audience, mostly middle-aged white voters, asked about the minimum wage (she said she was not sure raising it would be realistic), immigration (she agreed with the governing coalition that fewer immigrants should be allowed in) and how to bring down the price of electricity (\"We need an orderly retirement of coal,\" she said).\\n\\nMs. Steggall said she favored lifting a luxury tax on electric vehicles and promised to promote renewable energy, but only gradually. She touched on an anxiety that I heard repeatedly from Australian voters: \"It\\'s not about taking dramatic action that will change your livelihood or lifestyle,\" she assured her audience.\\n\\nMs. Steggall is not alone in taking on Liberal Party stalwarts, either. She is among several independent candidates. Nearly all are campaigning on climate change.\\n\\n\"The fact that all these people are running is a huge message from the electorate,\" said Ebony Bennett, deputy director of The Australia Institute, a research group. \"We\\'ve never seen anything like it before.\"\\n\\nLivia Albeck-Ripka contributed reporting from Melbourne.\\n\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'somini_sengupta@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Somini Sengupta', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/29/science/00cli-australia-1/00cli-australia-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4772101', 'sentiment': 0.09019607843137245, 'wgt': 573}\n",

This once-obscure category allows foreign nationals to purchase a family pack of visas by investing capital in job-creating businesses in the United States. The price is $1 million. But EB-5 offers a lower-cost option (for $500,000) to visa applicants who invest in projects in rural or distressed urban areas. It's meant as an incentive for investment in impoverished America.\\n\\nWith its angular skyscrapers, luxury retailers and bizarre basket-shaped playground, Hudson Yards is the opposite of troubled -- financially -- although architecture critics have pounced on its placelessness. Yet New York State authorities enabled Related, the project's developer, to raise more than $1.2 billion in EB-5 financing at the lower-tier rate reserved for urban areas with severe unemployment. As I recently reported in CityLab, the state allowed Hudson Yards to qualify for this designation by gerrymandering a map that connects this elite West Side haven to public housing projects in Central and East Harlem.\\n\\nMuch of the nation badly needs investment. And place-based incentive programs like EB-5 could lure capital and jobs to distressed areas that have yet to recover from the foreclosure epidemic after the 2008 housing crash -- if the program worked properly. Hudson Yards is emblematic of how the EB-5 visa program has been corrupted by developers and state authorities to divert capital from places that need it to those that don't.\\n\\nOne of the reasons this happens is states draw the boundaries for Targeted Employment Areas, the economic zones with a lower threshold for investment visas -- $500,000 instead of $1 million. Investing in projects within these rural or low-resource urban areas is a good deal for visa applicants, since these visas cost less. Virtually all EB-5 investments are given at the discounted rate in targeted urban zones. It's supposed to help struggling places in America. But New York, Texas, California and most other states tilt the system in luxury's favor. Sometimes this means stringing together dozens of census tracts in long spaghetti-noodle maps to qualify luxury projects as falling within poor urban districts. The Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, the Resorts World Las Vegas and the Wharf in Washington are among the many projects that have raked in hundreds of millions in cash-for-visas financing.\\n\\nGerrymandering is only one thing that needs to change. The cash-for-visas program has garnered an impressive record of lawsuits and indictments for fraud and dozens of possible breaches of national security. While the program falls under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security, oversight is lax, and real estate is not its explicit domain. Reforming EB-5 is a vital priority, but legislation to fix this program is most likely just as doomed as any other immigration bill. According to New York University's Stern Center for Real Estate Finance Research, no proposal for a fix in Congress has reached a vote in committee.\\n\\nHudson Yards Is Manhattan's Biggest, Newest, Slickest Gated Community. Is This the Neighborhood New York Deserves?\\n\\nHudson Yards presented the city with a grand opportunity to remake Manhattan's West Side. But what has arrived? A review of the most ambitious private development in New York in a century.\\n\\nStill, the case for reform is urgent. It is not just that scammers are gaming the system. Or that it heaps risk on foreign investors, mostly Chinese nationals who face yearslong waiting lists to participate in the program (and few safeguards against fraud when they do). The EB-5 program could be putting money to work across America. Instead, mega-developers are skillfully redirecting the rewards. There's a maximum of 10,000 visas available annually through EB-5, which also limits how much money the program can create. Hudson Yards garnered so many investors that the visas it generated alone probably maxed out an entire year's quota.\\n\\nChange could be on the horizon. Regulations written during the waning days of the Obama administration, and largely prompted by Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, have yet to take effect (and might never). While the completed rule was delivered to the Office of Management and Budget in February, it will languish there until the Trump administration decides to proceed. The regulations would raise the thresholds for investment and eliminate the option of gerrymandering. Ultimately, the best road forward for EB-5 may be to maintain investment levels where they are, to maximize capital for distressed areas -- meaning single census tracts. No more district linguine.\\n\\nWhile prospects are dim, support for and opposition to reform do not fall along traditional partisan lines. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and a darling of the real-estate lobby, has joined Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz in leading the fight to preserve the status quo. The Kushner family has reportedly used Jared Kushner's proximity to the president to sell EB-5 properties to investors in China. It's feasible that EB-5 could unite the Trump administration with Representative Jerrold Nadler, the president's chief antagonist on the House Judiciary Committee, since his district covers much of the West Side of Manhattan -- including Hudson Yards.\\n\\nThe boondoggles facilitated by EB-5 are embarrassing. But the program could work elegantly. The fix is straightforward: Eliminate the gerrymandering. Kick states out of the qualifying process. Establish an escrow function that enables immigrants to make reasonably safe investments. If wealthy immigrants want to come to America and help build it up financially at the same time, let them. But bring an end to a reverse Robin Hood system that takes from Harlem and gives to Hudson Yards.\\n\\nKriston Capps is a staff writer at CityLab.\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Court documents filed in 2018 that surfaced this week show that Mr. Moore owes $75,000 in unpaid federal taxes, interest and penalties.\\n\\nLegal, ethical and tax issues have threatened to derail nominations in previous administrations but, under Mr. Trump, they have rarely felled candidates. Despite calls from Democrats on Thursday to drop Mr. Moore from contention, the White House signaled that it would stay the course with Mr. Moore, who has yet to be formally nominated.\\n\\nLarry Kudlow, the director of the White House\\'s National Economic Council, described Mr. Moore\\'s tax lien as an \"overpayment and refund issue\" that would not pose a problem if he was nominated.\\n\\n\"Easily solved,\" Mr. Kudlow said in a text message.\\n\\nA lien for $75,328.80 from the 2014 tax year was entered against Mr. Moore at the request of the federal government in January 2018 in Montgomery County, Md., where he resides, the records show.\\n\\nIn a phone interview on Thursday, Mr. Moore said the lien was the result of a \"huge miscalculation\" on the part of the Internal Revenue Service, and that he had been frustrated by the agency in a yearslong effort to resolve the issue.\\n\\nMr. Moore said that for a single tax year, he had claimed both the value of alimony to his former wife, which is deductible on federal tax forms, and also the value of his child support payments to her, which are not eligible for a tax break. He said the child support amounted to about $18,000, which, given his tax bracket, worked out to about $6,000 in taxes that he owed but did not pay.\\n\\n\"My accountant made a mistake,\" he said.\\n\\nFollowing an audit, Mr. Moore said, the I.R.S. deemed his return for that year \"fraudulent\" and disallowed the full value of his deductions. With penalties and fees, that amounted to a tax bill of more than $75,000.\\n\\nMr. Moore said that he and his current wife have tried for years to resolve the issue with the I.R.S., including dispute resolution, but have not succeeded. He said he overpaid his taxes by $50,000 in a subsequent year in an attempt at resolution, and has not heard from the agency in nearly two years.\\n\\n\"We believe that the I.R.S. made a huge miscalculation on what I owe,\" he said. \"We\\'ve been waiting two years. We can\\'t get resolution. That\\'s what\\'s so frustrating.\"\\n\\nAn I.R.S. spokesman declined to comment, saying that \"federal privacy and disclosure laws prohibit the I.R.S. from commenting on any individual or situation.\"\\n\\nDemocrats seized on Mr. Moore\\'s tax troubles, saying it is the latest example of an administration that has little regard for longstanding ethics rules.\\n\\n\"Aside from being patently unqualified for the job, we\\'ve now learned that Stephen Moore is a tax cheat who owes the government $75,000,\" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \"Stephen Moore should do Senate Republicans a favor and withdraw, rather than subject them to awkward questions about why an unqualified tax cheat should be rewarded with one of the most powerful economic policy jobs in the country.\"\\n\\nAmerican Bridge, the Democratic super PAC, also denounced the Trump administration for selecting Mr. Moore to a prominent job at the Fed.\\n\\n\"This is embarrassing even for an administration already flooded with cronies and incompetent staff, and the White House should withdraw Moore\\'s nomination immediately,\" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for American Bridge.\\n\\nDuring the early days of Mr. Trump\\'s term, several of his nominees faced questions over their finances during their confirmation hearings.\\n\\nMick Mulvaney, who is now Mr. Trump\\'s acting chief of staff, acknowledged when he was being confirmed for his previous job as budget director, that he had paid back taxes of more than $15,000 for a household employee whose payroll taxes he had not paid.\\n\\nFormer Representative Tom Price of Georgia, who in 2017 resigned as health secretary for using expensive chartered flights, had to defend stock trades that might have been impacted by his time in Congress during his confirmation hearing. And Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, was scolded by senators before being confirmed for failing to disclose $95 million of real estate assets on this ethics questionnaire.\\n\\nIn 2009, Timothy Geithner, who was former President Barack Obama\\'s first Treasury secretary, came under fire from Republicans for failing to pay more than $40,000 in federal taxes.\\n\\nBut many Republican senators were not overly concerned with Mr. Moore\\'s finances on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Steve has the right intellect, the right philosophy and the right background,\" said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, and a member of the banking committee. \"I\\'m not concerned -- unless there are piles and piles and piles of these. People have tax issues from time to time, especially people who have had as many career changes as he has.\"\\n\\nSenator Richard Shelby, a member of the banking committee, said he was not familiar with details of the case, but suggested that Mr. Moore should be subjected to a full review of his past dealings if and when Mr. Trump formally nominates him.\\n\\n\"Scrub him,\" Mr. Shelby said. \"People got to do the right thing -- and I assume he did -- but it\\'s got to be scrubbed.\"\\n\\nAllies of Mr. Moore said that a simple tax snafu should not raise questions about his ability to help steer the United States economy. Macroeconomics, they said, is a much different beast than the tax code.\\n\\n\"Being a tax accountant is very different than being a good tax economist,\" said Arthur Laffer, a prominent supply-side economist who recently wrote a book with Mr. Moore. \"He\\'s very good on tax economics.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'alan_rappeport@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Alan Rappeport', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/28/business/28DC-FEDMOOREprint/28DC-FEDMOOREprint-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4688889', 'sentiment': 0.09019607843137245, 'wgt': 564}\n",

Not Anymore.\", 'body': 'Beto O\\'Rourke started his presidential run with a nearly unprecedented asset: a trained and functioning ground operation, staffed and ready to deploy at the flick of a switch. When he lit it up on March 30, his campaign generated tens of thousands of text messages sent by volunteers and raised some $6 million in the first 24 hours.\\n\\nDays later, he named Jen O\\'Malley Dillon, a Barack Obama veteran, as campaign manager. The decision led inexorably to the jettisoning of that field operation and its two architects, Bernie Sanders alumni Becky Bond and Zack Malitz, whose departures from the O\\'Rourke campaign were reported on Saturday by BuzzFeed News.\\n\\nThe internal conflict between O\\'Malley Dillon and Bond is more than just personnel drama -- it suggests that O\\'Rourke has settled on a strategic direction for his campaign. O\\'Rourke, who won an insurgent primary campaign to get to Congress, and ran as a political outsider against Sen. Ted Cruz, is refashioning himself as an insider.\\n\\n\"If he doesn\\'t run a similar campaign that he\\'s run his entire career, he\\'s not gonna be the same candidate,\" said Lillian Salerno, a Texas congressional candidate in 2018 and an outspoken O\\'Rourke supporter. \"The loss of Bond and Malitz makes me think he is going to run down the middle, and if he runs down the middle, he will get run over,\" she added, an allusion to a Texas quote by her friend and occasional podcast co-host Jim Hightower.\\n\\nThe question dogging O\\'Rourke throughout his Senate campaign was whether he was too progressive for Texas. Around the country, the question soon became whether he was too conservative for a national Democratic primary. Ostensibly choosing Team Obama over the political revolution, O\\'Rourke took one more step toward reshaping himself as a more mainstream candidate.\\n\\nThere\\'s no place for self-proclaimed revolutionaries in a project like that.\\n\\nHis choice of campaign manager followed a few other tactical shifts: During the Senate campaign, he embraced Medicare for All, but as a presidential candidate, he now backs a more incremental approach. During his Senate bid, he pledged not to take money from fossil fuel lobbyists and executives. When it was discovered that he had taken such contributions, he declined to return the executives\\' money and has refused to take a similar pledge. Earlier this year, O\\'Rourke was surging and looked to be one of the most viable candidates in the pack. Instead of leaning into what got him where he was, he tried to play it safe and coast as an insider to the nomination. And during his Senate run, he eschewed high-dollar fundraisers, declining to meet one-on-one or in small groups with wealthy donors. On May 13, he\\'ll be in New York City for a fundraiser where hosts are asked to raise $25,000 each. There\\'s no place for self-proclaimed revolutionaries in a project like that. The irony for O\\'Rourke is that as a Gen X former punk rocker, the fear of selling out looms larger than death itself.\\n\\nThe decisions O\\'Malley Dillon, who co-founded the corporate and political consulting firm Precision Strategies, makes as she builds her team will be a preview of how O\\'Rourke would staff his administration and who he\\'d hand power to.\\n\\nBond and Malitz, meanwhile, represent the wing of the party invigorated by Sanders\\'s 2016 campaign, of which they were key players. They helped develop what came to be called \"barnstorms,\" events where volunteers would be empowered to organize on their own. Eventually, volunteers themselves began running barnstorms, and the organizing capacity grew exponentially, even if it arrived too late in the Sanders campaign to change the outcome of the 2016 primary.\\n\\nBond, along with Sanders veteran Zack Exley, wrote about the experience in the book \"Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything.\" She and Malitz pitched O\\'Rourke\\'s 2018 Texas Senate campaign on fully implementing the \"big organizing\" vision. O\\'Rourke signed off, giving Bond and Malitz extraordinary leeway to run a radically different variety of a field operation, one that turned power over to volunteers rather than centralizing it at the campaign\\'s headquarters.\\n\\nThe strategy suited O\\'Rourke, who had sworn off Washington consultants and wasn\\'t interested in high-dollar fundraising. That allowed him to do what he enjoyed: drive around Texas while broadcasting on Facebook Live, hold town halls in every corner of the state, and take unapologetic stands on racism and immigrant justice -- and, with some air-drumming and skateboarding, just generally be the anti-Ted Cruz. That approach blended perfectly with a fundraising and turnout strategy that relied on inspiring thousands of supporters to become active donors and volunteers.\\n\\nThat approach blended perfectly with a fundraising and turnout strategy that relied on inspiring thousands of supporters to become active donors and volunteers.\\n\\nThe result was unlike anything that had been seen in a get-out-the-vote operation. Volunteers were deputized to open campaign offices across Texas, and more than 700 popped up. The campaign posted real-time voter contact targets online, an unprecedented level of transparency. On the Sunday before the election, the campaign knocked on 340 doors per minute and hit roughly half a million that weekend. He raised a record-shattering $79 million, almost entirely from small donors. After O\\'Rourke significantly outperformed in public polls, losing by less than 3 points, Bond and Malitz pledged to stick with him if he decided to run for president. As O\\'Rourke journaled his way through the decision process, Bond and Malitz stayed in El Paso to lay the groundwork for the potential campaign.\\n\\nIt became clear that O\\'Rourke was preparing to announce in late March when his campaign emailed volunteers from the Senate campaign, saying, \"We need help sending some text messages tomorrow morning.\" This request suggested that what Bond calls big organizing would be a central part of the campaign strategy.\\n\\nIn his launch video, O\\'Rourke made an appeal to big organizing. \"Even if you cannot be here on March 30,\" he said, \"I still want your help organizing where you live, bringing in friends and family and neighbors to the greatest grassroots campaign this country has ever seen.\"\\n\\nWhile O\\'Rourke deliberated on whether and how to run, he met with a number of top figures in the Democratic Party, including Obama, O\\'Malley Dillon\\'s former boss. Salerno, the former Texas congressional candidate, and others speculated that establishment figures advised O\\'Rourke to bring on seasoned Washington consultants if he wanted to be taken seriously. Indeed, O\\'Malley Dillon\\'s hiring was framed as O\\'Rourke \"professionalizing\" his campaign, despite the results of her tenure at the DNC.\\n\\n\"In Washington, O\\'Malley Dillon\\'s hiring was taken as a sign that O\\'Rourke\\'s once-skeletal campaign was taking on a more professional cast, moving past the relatively small team that had helped propel him to his narrow loss in the Texas Senate race,\" summed up BuzzFeed News. \"Democratic strategists see O\\'Malley Dillon as an organized and even-handed counterbalance to O\\'Rourke, who is known for his spontaneity and rejection of traditional campaign tactics, like the use of consultants and pollsters.\"\\n\\n\"Beto\\'s slippin\\' in his own grease.\"\\n\\nBut alarm bells among progressive organizers immediately went off. \"When I saw who was his campaign manager, I thought that isn\\'t going to go well,\" said Salerno. Would O\\'Malley Dillon embrace a radical new organizing model that took power out of the campaign headquarters? Could movement figures and corporate consultants work together toward a common goal?\\n\\nThe answer became clear less than a month after the campaign launch. The campaign offered an explanation that didn\\'t even attempt to make sense. \"Becky and Zack remain volunteers with our campaign but their temporary one-month launch positions have ended after successfully getting the organizing program off the ground across the country,\" the campaign\\'s statement reads. Donald Trump tells lies better than that. It\\'s absurd to suggest that Bond and Malitz stayed in El Paso through the winter simply for a temporary, monthlong gig to help set up a campaign. Bond and Malitz are widely respected organizers and were in high demand after the Senate campaign. The entire point of their commitment to O\\'Rourke was that he was open to a new model. Bond had talked frequently with friends about the potential of the O\\'Rourke campaign, and the importance of his campaign and administration being staffed by progressives. It was not a one-month project.\\n\\nThe volunteers being empowered, according to the campaign, are Bond and Malitz: \"As innovators in the field of organizing, they spent the last month working hard to ensure that our campaign was one in which anyone, anywhere could make a real difference from the very beginning. Becky and Zack remain close friends of the campaign, and true to form, they have already joined our army of grassroots volunteers who are signing up for shifts and committing to electing Beto president.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theintercept.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Intercept'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'ryan_grim@theintercept.com', 'name': 'Ryan Grim', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/04/AP_19107631886296-beto-1556045722-e1556045786468.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800', 'eventUri': 'eng-4740642', 'sentiment': 0.1529411764705881, 'wgt': 552}\n",

Check.\\n\\nIt is a frustration that his oft-promised new wall has yet to a single mile built. Check.\\n\\nIt is a natural outgrowth of an intrinsic hostility to people who are Hispanics. Check.\\n\\nBut I believe that it is also something more sophisticated and tactical than that: It is a play to the other, smaller part of his base, the black and Hispanic people who voted for him in 2016.\\n\\nBecause Trump\\'s path to victory was so impossibly narrow during the last election, and because he has done absolutely nothing to expand his base, he will need to hold on to all of the base he had.\\n\\nIt is worth remembering that in 2016, after years of the racist birtherism attack against President Barack Obama, after calling Mexicans rapists and murderers and after promising over and over to build the wall, Trump still won 28 percent of the Hispanic vote, 27 percent of the Asian vote and 8 percent of the black vote, according to exit polls.\\n\\n(It is important to note that in the cases where data is available, more minority men voted for Trump than women. Among black men, 13 percent voted from Trump compared with only 4 percent among black women, and among Hispanic men, 32 percent voted for Trump compared with only 25 percent among Hispanic women.)\\n\\nTrump wants to hold these numbers if not inch up a percent or two.\\n\\nHe has multiple strategies to do that among black people, especially black men. One was to have the spectacle of a black man, Kanye West, in the Oval Office extolling Trump as a father figure who makes him feel like \"Superman\" because he \"didn\\'t have a lot of male energy in my home.\"\\n\\nAnother is to constantly remind black people, and the rest of America, that black unemployment is at a record low -- a decline that began under Obama, it must always be noted. Indeed, as an Associated Press Fact Check pointed out, \"The most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under President Barack Obama, when it fell from a recession high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 7.8 percent in January 2017.\"\\n\\nBut Trump still touted in February: \"African-American, Hispanic American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.\" (As point of fact, black unemployment hit its low during Trump\\'s tenure but has ticked back up.)\\n\\nAdditionally, Trump signed the historic criminal justice First Step Act, which was a set of prison and sentencing reforms. I personally don\\'t think Trump cares much about criminal justice, particularly considering the way he has demeaned Black Lives Matter, demonized Colin Kaepernick and encouraged police brutality of crime suspects. But this was his son-in-law\\'s pet issue and Trump loves nothing more than to say that he did something for minority communities that Obama didn\\'t.\\n\\nThere, you can see what the tent poles of Trump\\'s re-election pitch will be to black voters. But he is also adding to that list his anti-immigrant stance, suggesting to black voters that the competition for low-wage jobs is a \"Hunger Games\"-type blood sport, that when immigrants arrive they diminish black people\\'s economic prospects.\\n\\nAs Trump said in January in an Oval Office address after shutting the government down because Congress wouldn\\'t fund the construction of his wall: \"All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\"\\n\\nThat is a pitch to both blacks and Hispanics already in this country. There is a real cleavage between second-, third- and forth-generation Hispanics and new arrivals.\\n\\nMy brother Marvin used to work as an accountant in the federal prison system. The institutions would regularly house groups separately, to avoid possible conflict. Two of those groups were Mexicans who had been in America for a while and Mexicans who were new arrivals. As my brother put it, a common refrain among the more established group was, \"They\\'ll help you move a refrigerator for $5.\"\\n\\nAs he understood it, it was all about the new arrivals causing embarrassment and being downward pressure on wages. This friction rings true to me and has existed among other groups of immigrants.\\n\\nDuring the first wave of the Great Migration of black people from the South to the North and West, some Northern black people were also afraid that the newcomers would upset the delicate balance that they thought they had achieved with white people.\\n\\nAs Kelly Miller, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the historically black Howard University, wrote in a letter to The New York Times in 1916:\\n\\n\"Should the influx of negro laborers to the North, without proper restriction and control, be allowed to prejudice public opinion and thus reproduce Southern proscription in the Northern States, the last state of the race would be worse than the first.\"\\n\\nAdd to this friction that although Americans often think of Hispanics as monolithic, they are anything but. Hispanics in America come from multiple countries and territories, some born abroad, others born here. Many of the asylum seekers at the border are from Central America. How Mexicans in California, Cubans in Florida or Puerto Ricans in New York feel about the influx may differ.\\n\\nFurthermore, we like to think of Hispanics as non-white, but Hispanic is an ethnicity, and Hispanics can identify as any color. Many Hispanics identify as white; they do so here and they do so in the home countries and territories. For instance, Puerto Rico is 99 percent Hispanic and nearly seven out of 10 people on the island identify as white.\\n\\nAlso, the longer Hispanics are in the United States, the less they identify as Hispanic. A 2017 Pew study found that while 97 percent of foreign-born Hispanics in America identify as Hispanic, only 50 percent of fourth-generation or higher Hispanics do.\\n\\nI believe that Trump\\'s team, if not him, understands the fissures in this immigration debate and is using them.\\n\\nA Quinnipiac University poll last year found that 54 percent of blacks and 55 percent of Hispanics thought immigrants\\' illegal crossing of the border with Mexico was an important problem., Additionally, 31 percent of blacks and 40 percent of Hispanics believed in using the National Guard to patrol the border with Mexico, and 13 percent of blacks and 25 percent of Hispanics supported the building of Trump\\'s wall.\\n\\nA poll taken at the end of last month by Quinnipiac found that 10 percent of black voters and 29 percent of Hispanic voters said that they would definitely vote, or consider voting, for Trump in 2020. That\\'s in line with 2016.\\n\\nAnd it would be a mistake to simply write off 2016 because minorities, particularly young black voters, were unhappy about Hillary Clinton\\'s participation in championing the 1994 Crime Bill and because she used the phrase \"super predator.\"\\n\\nThe front-runner among likely Democratic candidates is Joe Biden, a man who co-wrote the crime bill and was still bragging about it when he was Obama\\'s vice-presidential pick. Since then he has expressed regret.\\n\\nThe front-runner among the declared candidates is Bernie Sanders, whose appeal among black voters last cycle was worrisomely weak and who shows some signs of having retained that weakness.\\n\\nAs The Washington Post reported, Sanders held a rally in the gym of a century-old black church in North Charleston, S.C., last month. The room was packed, but, \"Of the more than 1,600 people who came to see the candidate, fewer than 40 were black.\"\\n\\nDemocrats must attack the issue of black and Hispanic voters head-on and not as an afterthought. They can\\'t go into 2020 thinking that the surge in voter turnout in the midterms is a ward against Trump holding the numbers of blacks and Hispanics he held in 2016. During the midterms, 9 percent of blacks and 29 percent of Hispanics voted for Republicans, in line with Trump\\'s 2016 results.\\n\\nWhite supremacy will use any tool at its disposal to survive.\\n\\nFrederick Douglass wrote in \"My Bondage and My Freedom\" that slave owners would often grant the enslaved relief from work during the Christmas holidays. But they would also encourage drunkenness and lasciviousness, and frown upon any slave who tried to put the time to productive use. This was psychological warfare.\\n\\nAs Douglass put it: \"All the license allowed, appears to have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom, and to make them as glad to return to their work, as they were to leave it.\"\\n\\nIf white supremacy will use celebration to disgust, it will most definitely use desperation to divide.\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In more normal times, its plans to open a new headquarters in Budapest would pass unnoticed.\\n\\nBut the bank\\'s chairman has longstanding ties to Russian intelligence agencies. And the Hungarian Parliament has effectively granted the bank diplomatic immunity from any scrutiny by police or financial regulators -- leaving Western security officials concerned that Russian spies could use it as a base to conduct European intelligence operations.\\n\\nSeveral European nations have expelled Russian agents and cracked down on Kremlin finances in an effort to to present a united front as Moscow is accused of meddling in the American election, poisoning a former spy in Britain and targeting European think tanks with hacking attacks.\\n\\nAnd if the Europeans are now concerned about the Russian bank, so are the Americans, especially since the Trump administration has cultivated Hungary\\'s prime minister, Viktor Orban, as an ally. Days before Parliament granted immunity to the Russian bank, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Mr. Orban in Budapest and warned against allowing Russia to drive a wedge between friends.\\n\\n\"Hungarians know all too well from their history that an authoritarian Russia will never be a friend to the freedom and sovereignty of smaller nations,\" he said.\\n\\nEurope has always been divided in its attitudes toward Russia, a split evident now in the number of far-right parties that are embracing the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. But the bank caught the attention of Western officials because Mr. Orban -- the leader of a country that is a member of both the European Union and NATO -- has stirred anxiety by steadily forging closer ties with the Russian leader.\\n\\nAn anti-immigrant, far-right leader who has systematically weakened Hungary\\'s democratic institutions, Mr. Orban has pointed to Russia as a beacon of his model of so-called illiberal democracy. He has worked to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and routinely lashes out at European Union leaders in Brussels, accusing them of endangering national security through immigration.\\n\\nThen late last summer, Hungarian officials stunned their American counterparts. The two countries had worked together in Hungary to capture a pair of Russians suspected of being arms dealers. The Justice Department moved quickly to extradite the two men to face trial in the United States, but Hungary sent them to Russia instead. \"It is unclear whether they will face trial,\" the State Department said in a pointed public statement.\\n\\nMr. Orban has awarded a Kremlin-owned company a no-bid contract worth billions of dollars to upgrade Hungary\\'s nuclear power plant and has criticized Western sanctions against Russia.\\n\\nHungary also secretly granted residency permits to a Russian lawmaker, Vladimir Blotskiy, and his relatives, as well as family members of the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin, leading to accusations that Hungary has become a backdoor for Russians who otherwise would struggle to settle in the European Union.\\n\\nBut only recently have analysts begun to question whether Mr. Orban was genuinely pivoting toward Moscow.\\n\\n\"A few years ago I would have said, \\'Yes there is this eastern shift by the Hungarian government, but Hungary still respects its European and American partnerships,\\'\" said Peter Kreko of Political Capital, a research group based in Budapest. \"I think it\\'s less and less the case today.\"\\n\\nMr. Kreko said there was a paradox in Mr. Orban\\'s willingness to grant immunity to a Russian bank on Hungarian soil: Mr. Orban had been reluctant to renew a military treaty with the United States over concerns it interfered with Hungary\\'s sovereignty.\\n\\n\"If that\\'s the case,\" Mr. Kreko asked, \"why are you giving these immunities to a Russian bank when there are these strong suspicions that it can be cover for Russian intelligence operations?\"\\n\\nThe Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said the bank\\'s relocation \"serves to further reinforce Budapest\\'s international financial positions.\" The Finance Ministry said the move would provide \"new opportunities for stakeholders from the Hungarian financial and economic sectors.\"\\n\\nDuring the Cold War, the bank served as a financial center for the Communist trade bloc. It fell into disarray with the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Mr. Putin\\'s government resurrected it under a new management team. It counts Cuba, Bulgaria, Hungary and Vietnam among its members, who govern the bank on a one-country-one-vote system. Russia is the largest contributor to the bank, controlling 40 percent of its assets, records show.\\n\\nThe bank\\'s chairman, Nikolay Kosov, comes from a prominent K.G.B. family, according to Western officials and a former Russian official. His father was the top Russian spy in Budapest during much of the 1970s, and his mother was hailed by the Russian news agency TASS as \"one of the most extraordinary spies of the 20th century.\"\\n\\nWestern security officials believe that Mr. Kosov himself served in Russian intelligence, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence matters. In a statement, the bank said he was \"in no way linked to K.G.B.\" His official biography says he served in various diplomatic postings during the Soviet era. The bank dismissed questions about his background as biased.\\n\\n\"They have absolutely nothing to do and have no relation to the bank, its chairman and shareholders, and therefore need no comment,\" the bank said in a statement. It said moving to Budapest was a natural step in its expansion. The bank noted that it had a diverse staff of multiple nationalities, and that more than half the assets had come from European countries.\\n\\nThe immunity deal passed in Parliament recently is not unusual for a multilateral investment bank, but government officials and experts say the arrangement makes little sense.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very difficult to say why this bank is coming to Hungary now,\" said Julius Horvath, an economics professor at Central European University in Budapest. \"It doesn\\'t appear to be based on economic considerations, rather political.\"\\n\\nOne European security official said the banking arrangement presented an opportunity for Mr. Putin to replenish his spy corps after the expulsion of scores of Russian officials from Europe and the United States. The expulsions were in retaliation for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.\\n\\nAgnes Vadai, an opposition lawmaker in the Hungarian Parliament, said: \"Now, people can be sent into this bank with full immunity, and we don\\'t know anything about who they are.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'matt_apuzzo@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Matt Apuzzo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/17/world/00russiabank1/merlin_150468750_f12fdb66-72f2-4767-9ae0-945f5043bf9b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 499}\n",

Ms. Sorokin wore designer clothes, lived in boutique hotels, dined in expensive restaurants and lured investors for a $40 million private club -- all without a penny to her name.\\n\\nShe has been held on Rikers Island since October 2017. Ms. Sorokin, 28, was convicted last month of most of the charges against her.\\n\\nHer lawyer, Todd Spodek, said during that trial that Ms. Sorokin was simply an enterprising business-minded woman eager to make it in the big city.\\n\\nBut jurors agreed with prosecutors that her gilt-edged life was an elaborate ruse financed by lies.\\n\\nIn addition to the prison sentence, Ms. Sorokin was fined $24,000 and ordered to pay restitution of about $199,000.\\n\\n\"I apologize for the mistakes I made,\" she said at the sentencing.\\n\\nMs. Sorokin stiffed hotels, persuaded a bank employee to give her a $100,000 line of credit, swayed a private jet company to let her fly on credit, and tried to secure a $25 million loan from a hedge fund. In all, she stole about $213,000 worth of money and services.\\n\\nStill, the jury found her not guilty of the most serious offense -- faking records in an attempt to obtain a $22 million loan. She was also acquitted of stealing from a friend who said Ms. Sorokin duped her into covering the cost of a $60,000 vacation to Morocco.\\n\\nTo many friends, there was every reason to believe that Ms. Sorokin was a wealthy German heiress named Anna Delvey with so much money that she frequently doled out $100 tips and flew on a private jet to Berkshire Hathaway\\'s annual investment conference.\\n\\nBut Kaegan Mays-Williams, a prosecutor, said during the trial that Ms. Sorokin\\'s only goal was to \"put herself in the best position to take money\" from the wealthy so that she could \"live the fantasy of an extravagant lifestyle.\"\\n\\nMr. Spodek said people believed what they wanted about Ms. Sorokin. She was enabled, he said, by a system \"seduced by glamour and glitz.\" She intended to pay back her creditors, he said.\\n\\n\"Through her sheer ingenuity, she created the life that she wanted for herself,\" he said. \"Anna was not content with being a spectator, but wanted to be a participant.\"\\n\\nRead more about Anna Sorokin\\'s elaborate ruseFake Heiress Who Swindled N.Y.\\'s Elite Is Found GuiltyApril 25, 2019Does This Dress Make Me Look Guilty?April 25, 2019\\n\\nMs. Sorokin, a Russian immigrant from a middle-class family, arrived in New York from Paris in 2014. She had lofty dreams of opening a members-only arts club on Park Avenue South called A.D.F., for the Anna Delvey Foundation. In 2015, she enlisted the architect Gabriel Andres Calatrava to create what she envisioned would be a club similar to Soho House New York, with a bar, a nightclub and an art exhibit. Mr. Calatrava is the son of Santiago Calatrava, an architect who designed the Oculus, the centerpiece of the World Trade Center transit hub.\\n\\nShe also solicited help from the hotelier André Balazs, the British-American entrepreneur Roo Rogers and the real estate developer Aby Rosen.\\n\\nShe said she had found the perfect location for her club: 281 Park Avenue South, a landmark building. The project was expected to cost up to $40 million.\\n\\nAt first, Mr. Calatrava and others believed she was good for it. Prosecutors said she told people that she had a trust fund and was worth 60 million euros.\\n\\nShe tried hard to get loans from banks and hedge funds, prosecutors said. She forged financial statements, and created a fake accountant and a phony financial adviser with emails that linked back to her, prosecutors said.\\n\\nMs. Sorokin tried to get a $22 million loan from City National Bank, but a banker rejected her request when he could not determine the source of her wealth. Mr. Calatrava had also stopped working with her when she could not provide proof that she could fund the project.\\n\\nShe then tried to secure a $25 million loan from Fortress Investment Group, prosecutors said, but she needed to pay it a fee as part of the process to secure the loan. She turned to City National Bank and talked a banker into giving her a line of credit on her account for $100,000. She promised to repay it with a wire transfer from a European account.\\n\\nAfter Fortress began investigating Ms. Sorokin\\'s personal and financial information, she withdrew from the deal, prosecutors said, and Fortress returned a little more than half of the money she provided. Instead of giving that money back to City National Bank, she spent it on expensive clothing and five-star hotels.\\n\\nProsecutors said Ms. Sorokin also tricked a friend, Rachel Williams, into spending $62,000 to cover the cost of a luxury trip to Marrakesh, Morocco, with two other people. The group stayed at the La Mamounia hotel, where they had a private villa with a courtyard, a pool and a butler.\\n\\nWhen they returned to New York City, Ms. Sorokin promised to repay Ms. Williams back through a wire transfer, Ms. Williams testified. Ms. Sorokin only returned $5,000 of what Ms. Williams said she was owed. A jury acquitted Ms. Sorokin of the charges associated with Ms. Williams.\\n\\nIn Manhattan, Ms. Sorokin moved from one luxurious hotel to the next, according to prosecutors. She was kicked out of 11 Howard in SoHo for not paying her bill. At the Beekman hotel, she had racked up an $11,000 tab. The W New York also forced her out when she did not put a credit card on file.\\n\\nHer first arrest was in July 2017 at a restaurant inside the Le Parker Meridien hotel, where she was handed a lunch bill that was about $200.

Drawing on his own experience growing up in the agricultural hamlet of Clyde, Ohio, he breathed life into a band of neurotic castaways adrift on the flatlands of the Midwest, each of them in their own way struggling -- and failing -- to locate meaning, personal connection and love amid the town\\'s elm-shaded streets.\\n\\nThese \"grotesques,\" as Anderson called them, had allowed doubt and fear to overwhelm their better instincts. They were, the writer believed, casualties of a close-minded culture, condemned to live out a lonely, alienated existence. \"Winesburg\" quickly became a cultural byword, a metaphor for the yawning emptiness of rural life.\\n\\nToday that book, \"Winesburg, Ohio,\" is a staple of high school English classes and an acknowledged classic -- No. 24 on the Modern Library\\'s list of 100 best American novels. But the path that the book, published a century ago on May 8, 1919, took to literary renown was anything but direct.\\n\\nBy the time the boutique publisher B.W. Huebsch read Anderson\\'s manuscript in August 1918, it had already been rejected on both sides of the Atlantic. Even London\\'s John Lane Company, which had put out Anderson\\'s previous works -- two novels and a book of verse -- when no New York publisher would touch them, dismissed it as \"too gloomy.\" But Huebsch, who had introduced American readers to James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence, agreed to publish it.\\n\\nOver its first two years the book, as skeptics had foreseen, sold a modest 5,000 copies. By contrast, Sinclair Lewis\\'s take on small-town life, \"Main Street,\" published a year later, surpassed 390,000 in sales during the same interval.\\n\\nAnderson\\'s book fared little better with critics. Although some, including the literary kingmaker H.L. Mencken, lavished \"Winesburg\" with praise -- \"Here, indeed, is a piece of work that stands out from the common run of fiction like the Alps from the Piedmont plain,\" he wrote -- many reviewers were savage. The journalist Heywood Broun thought the book \"monotonous,\" while others complained that Anderson\\'s descriptions lacked depth and that his characters were one-dimensional \"puppets with names.\"\\n\\nAnderson became known as \\'the phallic Chekhov.\\'\\n\\nBut the most vehement attacks targeted Anderson\\'s alleged preoccupation with sex. And indeed many of the \"Winesburg\" stories, in violation of the prevailing literary taboos, openly explored the destructive effects of stifled desire, sexual repression and perversion. Anderson became known as \"the phallic Chekhov,\" whose book, according to an anonymous reviewer in The New York Evening Post, \"no man would wish to see in the hands of his daughter or sister.\"\\n\\nPerhaps nowhere was Anderson more despised than in his hometown, Clyde. The town\\'s head librarian burned copies of his book, and for many years, any patron of the Clyde Public Library who requested it was met with a scowl as she fumbled for the key to a locked closet where she stored, together with other \"bad books,\" a single copy that had somehow escaped the flames.\\n\\nWriting in his memoirs two decades later, Anderson recalled that after \"Winesburg\" came out, \"for weeks and months, my mail was loaded with letters calling me \\'filthy,\\' \\'an opener of sewers.\\'\" The criticism, he said, \"made me ill.\"\\n\\nA hundred years on, it\\'s difficult to see what all the fuss was about. No modern reader would blush at Anderson\\'s treatment of sex, chaste by contemporary standards. \"Winesburg\" owes its longevity not to shock value but to how perfectly it captured a society on the brink of colossal change. Decades after the book\\'s publication, Waldo Frank, who had printed some of the early \"Winesburg\" stories in his magazine, The Seven Arts, remarked that Anderson had undertaken to describe \"a Mid-American world that already then was a generation dead.\"\\n\\nIndeed, Winesburg -- with its dirt roads, horses and gas lights, its farmers, shopkeepers and artisans -- represented a rural culture soon to be swept by unprecedented social and technological ferment. When the superintendent of the United States census declared the American frontier closed in 1890, two-thirds of Americans still resided in small farm towns not unlike Winesburg. But by 1920, for the first time in the nation\\'s history, the majority of Americans were living in urban areas.\\n\\nA number of factors contributed to this demographic shift, including a boom in American industry during World War I, which drew millions of workers to cities in search of jobs, large numbers of immigrants arriving from Eastern and Southern Europe, and the Great Migration of nearly half a million African-Americans from the South (including a staggering 10.4 percent of the combined black population of Alabama and Mississippi) to cities in the Midwest and the West and along the Eastern Seaboard.\\n\\nAt the same time, daily life was speeding up. In 1900 the horse remained the primary means of travel, and fewer than 14,000 automobiles -- which most people viewed as playthings of the rich -- bumped along the nation\\'s rutted roads; by 1920 there were nine million. Passenger trains more than doubled their ridership and tripled the number of miles traveled in the decade before the 1920 census, helping to make the railroads the country\\'s largest industry and biggest employer. Electric streetcars, first deployed in 1888, were now rumbling through thousands of towns and cities, heralding the age of the commuter. The noise and filth of urban living, helped along by the prejudices of affluent city dwellers seeking to escape growing racial and ethnic diversity downtown, led to the advent of \"streetcar suburbs,\" whose quiet, tree-lined avenues mimicked the small-town aesthetic of days gone by.\\n\\nOther innovations, too -- telephones, electric lights, subways, running water, sewage lines, paved streets, even house numbers -- transformed how Americans lived. A combination of rising wages and shorter work weeks created a new class of consumers, people with the time and money to partake of all of those products spilling out of factories around the country.\\n\\nOpinion | Jeffrey N.

But in 1913, after a nervous breakdown, he deserted his wife and children and moved to Chicago. There he fell into a literary milieu that the critic Carl Van Doren called \"the revolt from the village,\" made up of newcomers to the city who, like Anderson, trained their writerly attentions on the rural settings they had left behind. Its chief exponent was the poet Edgar Lee Masters and his \"Spoon River Anthology,\" published in 1915, a collection of verse ostensibly in the voices of villagers buried in the cemetery of a fictional Illinois small town. The book, with its dark view of small-town life, became an unlikely international best seller and inspired Anderson to begin writing the stories that were to become \"Winesburg, Ohio.\"\\n\\nThe village revolt soon ran its course, as did Anderson\\'s career. He continued to publish and enjoyed a few years of fame in the 1920s, even if his books, with the exception of his 1925 novel \"Dark Laughter,\" never sold well. He was soon overtaken by younger writers: Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, John Dos Passos, Erskine Caldwell, William Saroyan, John Steinbeck -- all took inspiration from \"Winesburg,\" with its simple, declarative rhythms and steadfast concern for the plight of common people.\\n\\nHemingway and Faulkner, in particular, sought Anderson\\'s advice and support, which he happily provided, acting as a mentor to both and helping to get their first books into print. As their fortunes rose and his declined, they sought to distance themselves from Anderson with novels that cruelly mocked his personality and his prose style: Faulkner\\'s \"Mosquitoes\" and Hemingway\\'s \"The Torrents of Spring.\"\\n\\nAnderson died in March 1941 of an intestinal infection, having accidentally swallowed a toothpick at a New York cocktail party. But his literary influence continued to be felt -- something Faulkner himself later acknowledged. In December 1950, accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature, he told the audience in Stockholm\\'s City Hall that he and his entire generation of American writers were \"all of us children of Sherwood Anderson.\"\\n\\nBruce Falconer is the senior editor of The American Scholar.\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Shanahan, were a major step in President Trump\\'s effort to build his border wall without congressional authorization since he declared a national emergency and took other measures to redirect funds in February. They came the same day immigration officials reported that illegal border crossings continued to surge in April, with the highest number of monthly arrests since 2007.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s efforts to divert funds to build the barriers are facing challenges in court, and have met fierce resistance from Democrats and some Republicans in Congress. Democrats have also expressed skepticism about a White House request for billions of dollars more in enforcement efforts at the border.\\n\\nBut Mr. Shanahan, testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee, vowed to push ahead. He said about half a mile of barrier would be built each day, using money that includes funds reallocated from the Department of Homeland Security and Treasury forfeiture assets.\\n\\n\"How you will see this materialize in the next six months is that about 63 additional new miles of wall will come online,\" Mr. Shanahan said.\\n\\nMr. Shanahan, who said there are also now 4,364 National Guard and active-duty troops along the border, has already authorized the first transfer of Defense Department funds to fencing construction.\\n\\nDemocrats, particularly in the House majority, have continued to push back against Mr. Trump\\'s wall plans. In a spending bill passed this month by the House Appropriations subcommittee focused on military construction and veterans affairs, lawmakers made a point of denying the administration\\'s request for money to replace the reallocated funds and for future installments of wall funding.\\n\\n\"The committee believes that Congress must assert its role as a coequal branch of the federal government and insist upon the regular appropriation of funds,\" wrote the committee, led by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida. \"The committee believes that military construction dollars should be used only for the purpose they are provided.\"\\n\\nThe White House\\'s request for $4.5 billion in money for enforcement efforts at the border -- an emergency supplemental package on top of the billions available under Mr. Trump\\'s national emergency declaration -- has also met some skepticism from Democrats on both sides of the Capitol, especially amid a push to combine the request with a second emergency disaster package.\\n\\nMr. Shanahan lobbied lawmakers to approve the disaster aid package, citing a number of military bases damaged by hurricanes last year. Mr. Trump spent time on Wednesday visiting Tyndall Air Force Base in northern Florida, which is still recovering from Hurricane Michael, but did not address the debate over disaster aid.\\n\\nHouse Democrats are still examining the request for more border funding, which would provide money for both humanitarian necessities and more beds to hold migrants in custody, according to an aide.\\n\\nBut immigration officials, in separate testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued that congressional action was needed to counter what Carla L. Provost, the chief of the Border Patrol, called \"off the charts\" numbers of people detained.\\n\\nIn April, immigration officials said, 109,144 migrants were detained crossing the border without permission, bringing the total number of unauthorized crossings this year to 460,294. More than half of the monthly arrests were people in families.\\n\\n\"It\\'s like holding a bucket under a faucet,\" Ms. Provost said. \"It doesn\\'t matter how many buckets you give me if we can\\'t turn off the flow.\"\\n\\n\"Our nation cannot solve today\\'s crisis with yesterday\\'s framework,\" she added.\\n\\nLike other immigration officials pressed on the administration\\'s budgetary requests in recent weeks, Ms. Provost and other officials described an overwhelmed immigration system, short-staffed and unprepared to deal with not only a high number of migrants, but also young children and families at facilities intended for single adults.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t really care how you label it,\" Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said at the hearing. \"The entire system is breaking, and it\\'s unsustainable.\"\\n\\nDemocratic lawmakers on the committee focused on the Trump administration\\'s policies, which Senator Richard J.

The newest shift in funding is in addition to the $1 billion that the Defense Department transferred to wall construction in March from the Army\\'s personnel budget.\\n\\nMr. Shanahan insisted on Friday that the budget transfer would not affect \"readiness,\" the military catchall term that refers to the ability of American troops to fight when called up. But some of the funds -- officials say $600 million -- \"did come from money we were under-running or saving or whatever, you know, terminology you want to use, from Afghanistan,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Pentagon notified Congress of the funding switch on Friday, one day after White House officials said that Mr. Trump would nominate Mr. Shanahan to formally fill the job left vacant when Jim Mattis resigned as defense secretary in December.\\n\\nThe twinning of the moves is bound to affect what was already going to be a challenging confirmation battle for Mr. Shanahan. In a letter to the acting defense secretary on Friday, several Democratic senators sharply criticized the diversion of funds from the Afghan war effort.\\n\\n\"Once again, the Department of Defense has ignored decades of precedent and cooperation with the Congress in carrying out a transfer of funds without regard to any consultation with the Appropriations Committee,\" said the letter, which was signed by Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, among others. \"We are dismayed that the department has chosen to prioritize a political campaign promise over the disaster relief needs of our service members.\"\\n\\nIn the letter, the senators pointedly made a link to Mr. Shanahan\\'s coming confirmation battle.\\n\\n\"We note that the decision to notify us of the reprogramming comes the day after you testified before the subcommittee on defense, and hours after the announcement of the president\\'s intent to nominate you to be secretary of defense,\" the senators wrote. \"We look forward to hearing your views on how you intend to repair the damaged relationship between the defense oversight committees and the department.\"\\n\\nIn particular, lawmakers are irate that the Pentagon is taking money that was meant for fighting a war and using it for what Democrats view as a political move intended to assuage Mr. Trump\\'s base.

The administration is pushing the changes to ensure that the benefits are awarded only to verified citizens -- a move that was made without the knowledge of many longtime housing officials at the department.\\n\\nCurrent rules bar undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing subsidies, but allow families of mixed immigration status to live in subsidized housing as long as one household member is a legal resident. The subsidies are prorated based on the number of eligible members of the family. According to the HUD analysis, more than 108,000 people receiving benefits are in a household with at least one undocumented immigrant.\\n\\nUnder the proposed rule, families of mixed status would no longer be permitted to live in public housing. Members who are in the country legally would be allowed to stay in their home, but the analysis found that they would be unlikely to do so: The fear of a family separation alone -- and displacing one or both of a child\\'s parents or guardians -- would have the effect of driving the entire family, including children, to vacate.\\n\\n\"HUD assumes that most mixed households will leave HUD\\'s assisted housing as a result of this rule,\" the analysis said, adding that the agency \"expects that fear of the family being separated would lead to prompt evacuation by most mixed households, whether that fear is justified.\"\\n\\nThe rules are currently in a public comment stage and are not yet in effect.\\n\\nIn proposing the change, administration officials pointed to the long waiting lists for public housing, underlining that the changes would open the door to citizens struggling to obtain affordable housing.\\n\\n\"We are putting America\\'s most vulnerable first,\" Ben Carson, the secretary of HUD, said in a statement last month. \"Our nation faces affordable housing challenges, and hundreds of thousands of citizens are waiting for many years on wait lists to get housing assistance.\"\\n\\nBut experts said that most of the residents now likely to be displaced are citizens or legally permitted to live in the United States.\\n\\n\"It reverses a very sensible policy that\\'s been in place for more than two decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations,\" said Douglas Rice, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank. \"It does nothing to address the affordable housing that exists. In fact, the rule will take assistance away from one set of eligible U.S. citizens and immigrants and give it to another. So there\\'s really no net gain.\"\\n\\nFor months, Stephen Miller, one of President Trump\\'s top advisers, has pushed the administration to institute regulations that would penalize legal immigrants who rely on public benefits as part of a larger effort to limit the number of immigrants living in the country. One such regulation would declare an immigrant who uses welfare benefits to be a \"public charge,\" making him or her ineligible for permanent status.\\n\\nMr. Miller, along with White House aides, sent the new regulations to HUD officials this year; Mr. Carson was not pleased with the changes, and questioned how they would be enforced but did not object, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nThe regulations were closely held among officials at the department\\'s legal division for weeks, without being shared with those in the public housing division, who were alarmed by a policy many believed to be both immoral and unenforceable, according to a senior official at the department with direct knowledge of their complaints.\\n\\nCareer department officials pushed hard for a provision that would allow for a renewable six-month extension for tenants facing eviction. They have also argued that the new policy could cost the already-struggling agency millions in rent because undocumented immigrants are often among the most reliable tenants -- because they do not want the scrutiny that missing payments would invite, the senior official said.\\n\\nA spokesman for HUD did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.\\n\\nReplacing households of mixed immigration status with households of only eligible residents would require the agency to provide full subsidies for each resident, costing HUD at least $193 million, the analysis found, and legal experts said the proposal would only exacerbate homelessness.\\n\\nRather than Congress allocating the funds, it is more likely that HUD would redirect resources to pay for the subsidies, the analysis found. Doing so could affect the number of households on the waiting list who receive public housing or the quality of housing.\\n\\n\"With part of the budget being redirected to cover the increase in subsidy, there could be fewer households served under the housing choice vouchers program; while for public housing, this would have an impact on the quality of service,\" according to the analysis, \"e.g., maintenance of the units and possibly deterioration of the units that could lead to vacancy.\"\\n\\nThe proposed rules would also require those eligible for the subsidies under the age of 62 to provide proof of their legal status. It would also prevent undocumented immigrants from serving as lease holders.\\n\\n\"This is part of a longstanding pattern with this administration of instituting anti-immigrant policies,\" said Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers\\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \"This one is particularly callous because it will no doubt result in children being rendered homeless.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'zolan_kanno_youngs@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/us/politics/10dc-immig/merlin_137368746_db7644c5-11c0-471a-bd42-10a3ab3c18aa-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4780390', 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'wgt': 449}\n",

When Mr. Trump considered whether to ask a court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act despite opposition from his own top legal advisers, Mr. Mulvaney\\'s response: Follow your gut.\\n\\nIn his first 100 days as the president\\'s acting chief of staff, Mr. Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr. Trump\\'s circle but one markedly different than the previous two occupants of his corner office. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Trump has a chief of staff who has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president\\'s conservative instincts -- to let Trump be Trump, in effect.\\n\\nA former congressman from South Carolina and a founder of the Tea Party caucus, Mr. Mulvaney is not a product of the Republican establishment like Reince Priebus, the first chief of staff, or the military hierarchy, like John F. Kelly, the second. Instead, he arrived at the White House from the revolutionary wing of the conservative movement, whose goal even before Mr. Trump entered politics was to blow up what it considered a corrupt and liberal Washington.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that he sees the role of the chief of staff to alter the personality of the person he works for,\" said former Representative Trey Gowdy, a friend and fellow South Carolina Republican who golfed with the president and Mr. Mulvaney last month. \"They have a good relationship, but the president\\'s the boss.\"\\n\\nSome outsiders see the cascade of hard-line policy ventures, unorthodox appointments and high-level purges of recent days as a sign of Mr. Mulvaney\\'s expanding influence, assuming that he is pushing Mr. Trump to the right. But insiders call that a misconception, insisting that Mr. Mulvaney at most is pushing on an open door and otherwise is merely liberating Mr. Trump to pursue the courses he prefers.\\n\\nThe lessons Mr. Mulvaney took from the unhappy experiences of Mr. Priebus and Mr. Kelly -- both of whom were ultimately cast out on Twitter -- was that Mr. Trump is not interested in being managed by aides who think they know better, and so he has tried to build a process that he thinks better serves the president.\\n\\nTo some Republicans who had become resigned to an ungovernable White House, Mr. Mulvaney has been a welcome presence, one who has tamped down some of the tribal rivalries that played out in vicious form through clandestine disclosures to the news media.\\n\\n\"I think he\\'s become an asset because he\\'s learned how to keep the Trump train running,\" said Scott Reed, the top political adviser to the United States Chamber of Commerce. \"A combination of managing the staff, raising the morale and limiting the leaking has made him a successful Trump chief of staff.\"\\n\\nBut to his critics, including some Republicans, Mr. Mulvaney\\'s approach has unleashed the president in dangerous ways. After forcing a five-week government shutdown at the start of the year, Mr. Trump in recent days threatened to close the nation\\'s southern border, selected unconventional nominees for the Federal Reserve despite significant vetting issues and began clearing out the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nIn a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, lamented the \"chaos\" in the White House stemming from the president\\'s \"whimsical, erratic\" behavior.\\n\\n\"I hope that the president or some of the people around him will realize that his administration is far from a fine-tuned machine,\" he said. \"It\\'s a slow-motion disaster machine that the American people see in action every day.\"\\n\\nEven some Republicans on Capitol Hill hold Mr. Mulvaney in low regard, particularly senators who view him as a former congressman with little deal-making experience and scant inclination to learn. In recent days, some criticized the expanding homeland security purge while others complained that Mr. Mulvaney does not meet with them enough.\\n\\nDuring tense negotiations amid the government shutdown earlier this year, Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican and Appropriations Committee chairman, complained bitterly about Mr. Mulvaney\\'s penchant for undoing weeks of bipartisan work with a quick comment to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Mr. Shelby told Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee\\'s top Democrat, that Mr. Mulvaney was \"the most dangerous man\" in Washington, according to three people familiar with the exchange.\\n\\nMr. Shelby has not repeated that in public, but when a reporter on Capitol Hill asked him about Mr. Mulvaney last week, the senator tartly interrupted to offer a correction.\\n\\n\"You mean the acting chief of staff?\" he said before walking away.\\n\\nMr. Trump has yet to formally remove the \"acting\" before the title, but after more than three months Mr. Mulvaney shrugs that off, telling others that everyone who works for the president serves at his pleasure and therefore is acting.\\n\\nIndeed, Mr. Mulvaney is operating not as a temporary caretaker, but as someone who expects to stay for a while, bringing to the West Wing a clutch of aides from the Office of Management and Budget, where he served as director. He has engaged in team-building exercises like retreats at Camp David, most recently last week to discuss efforts to create a replacement for the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nHe is generally liked by the staff, which recoiled at Mr. Kelly\\'s military style. Mr. Kelly made clear that he hated the job, muttering out loud when he left on many evenings that he might not return the next day. By contrast, Mr. Mulvaney tells people that he loves the job, an attitude that allies said has improved morale.\\n\\nEven some Democrats praised Mr. Mulvaney for reaching out. Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said his relations with Mr. Mulvaney were \"excellent\" and noted that he was invited to Camp David for a trust-building visit.\\n\\n\"Mick\\'s never going to resolve Trump\\'s erratic behavior,\" Mr. Yarmuth said. \"He\\'s never going to be able to do anything about that. But overall, I think he\\'s been a much more effective chief than Kelly has.\"\\n\\nStill, Mr. Mulvaney has been criticized internally, by colleagues unwilling to be identified, for creating his own fief. And he has been faulted for appealing to Mr. Trump\\'s nativist instincts and desire to cater to his hard-core political base.\\n\\nMr. Trump does not share Mr. Mulvaney\\'s special passion for hawkish fiscal policies but signed off on a largely symbolic budget that incorporated some of those priorities, only to overrule his aides when proposed funding cuts to Special Olympics were publicized.\\n\\n\"The biggest problem I sense with Mulvaney is because of his own politics, he tends to push Trump further to the right than even Trump might want to go,\" said Leon E. Panetta, who held the job under President Bill Clinton. \"As chief of staff, your greater responsibility is to present to the president the options for what he should decide.\"\\n\\nMr. Mulvaney has told people that he makes a point of doing just that, ensuring that the president hears different points of view. During the deliberations over the Affordable Care Act, allies noted that Mr. Mulvaney made sure that Mr. Trump heard objections lodged by the Justice Department and White House counsel.\\n\\nWhile Mr. Mulvaney has kept the essence of Mr. Kelly\\'s policy-development procedure, he makes a point of consulting with Mr. Trump earlier in the process to get his direction. Although he was known as a firebrand in the House who stood up to Republican leaders, he is deferential to Mr. Trump, calling him \"boss,\" while making a point of spending off hours on the golf course with him.\\n\\nIn the West Wing, Mr. Mulvaney is seen as someone who knows when to fight battles, as opposed to Mr. Kelly, who often found himself at odds with Mr. Trump\\'s adult children and informal advisers. He does not try to manage access to the president as Mr. Kelly did. Rather than fight Mr. Trump\\'s natural desire to meet and talk with a variety of people, Mr. Mulvaney has taken a decentralized approach that he calls chief of staff by committee, empowering different advisers to provide the president their guidance.\\n\\nIt is a style most associated with Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, each of whom resisted having a strong chief of staff at first, preferring what was called a \"hub and spoke\" model in which many people had access to the Oval Office. Both eventually abandoned the approach, concluding that it did not work, and Mr. Mulvaney eschews the hub-and-spoke term to avoid associations with those failed experiments.\\n\\nPeople close to the president say Mr. Mulvaney gets too much credit -- or blame -- for Mr. Trump\\'s rightward turn on policy. Mr. Trump\\'s instinct is to appeal to core supporters who he fears will leave him, and he is the one who wants to demonstrate to them that he is continuing a hard line on immigration.\\n\\nDavid Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United and a former deputy campaign manager for Mr. Trump, said the president was adjusting to a changing political environment.\\n\\n\"The president is responding to that new world order and that\\'s the mind-set,\" Mr. Bossie said. \"He is under siege by congressional Democrats, and that is how he\\'s operating -- under siege.\"\\n\\nAnd Mr. Mulvaney is in the trench next to him.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'peter_baker@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Peter Baker', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/us/politics/09dc-mulvaney/09dc-mulvaney-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2078431372549019, 'wgt': 430}\n",

M., near El Paso, Texas. Barnard Construction Co. Inc., of Bozeman, Mont., was awarded a contract worth $187 million for \"design-bid-build construction project for primary pedestrian wall replacement\" in Yuma, Ariz. Both projects, announced on the Defense Department website, are slated for completion in fall 2020.\\n\\nTo pay for these new barriers, the Pentagon is diverting up to $1 billion to support the DHS to block \"drug-smuggling corridors\" in those areas. The Defense Department, triggered by Trump\\'s emergency declaration to build a border wall, took the unprecedented tactic of notifying Congress about the transfer of funding, rather than requesting the money through the appropriations process. The move drew fire from Democrats and Republicans who saw it as a way for the administration to sidestep Congress\\' Constitutional power over government spending.\\n\\nDefense Department officials played what amounts to a bureaucratic shell game to get the money. The Pentagon took leftover money that was allocated for military personnel and transferred it into a counter-drug account. That move gives the military authority to take measures to support federal law enforcement efforts to stop drug trafficking.\\n\\nThe new sections of wall, and the controversial measures taken to pay for them, are only part of the Pentagon\\'s increasing entanglements in the Administration\\'s policy toward undocumented immigrants.\\n\\nTrump directed the military to support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the border more than a year ago. The Defense Department has approved nine DHS requests in the past year, including aerial reconnaissance, ground surveillance, search and rescue support, medical support, engineering support, helicopter transportation, personnel protection and other needs. U.S. troops have also spent five months welding coils of razor wire atop southern border fences and points of entry with Mexico in California, Arizona and Texas.\\n\\nThere are now about 5,000 troops, including 2,000 members of the National Guard, deployed along the 2,000 mile-long southwest border. Current structures line only 654 miles of the frontier, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. In recent weeks, U.S. forces started parking white pick-up trucks mounted with telescopic video cameras, known as \"Mobile Surveillance Cameras,\" in all nine border Patrol Sectors in each of the four states bordering Mexico. The devices are armed with infrared cameras, enabling troops to watch for illegal border crossings to operate day or night.\\n\\nThe Pentagon entanglements in administration migration policy have worried both parties on Capitol Hill, and top U.S. military leaders faced questions from Congress Tuesday about the months-long troop presence along the southern border with Mexico.\\n\\nMarine Commandant Gen. Robert Neller wrote a memorandum last month to Navy Secretary Richard Spencer that listed factors that were causing budget shortfalls and impinging on Marines\\' ability to fight in combat. He wrote that nine unplanned events, including pay raises, hurricane damage to bases and the ongoing border deployment, had posed \"unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency.\" When Neller\\'s memo later became public, much of the focus centered on his mention of the border mission.\\n\\nHowever, Neller moved to downplay those concerns Tuesday as he sat alongside Spencer in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, claiming that the deployment\\'s effects have been minimal thus far. \"I personally checked the readiness of every unit down there, and with only one exception there was no impact on their actual readiness,\" Neller said. \"In fact a couple of units improved their readiness. So to say going to the border was degrading our readiness was not an accurate statement.\"\\n\\n\"Five hundred men for a month on the southern border is $1.25 million,\" he added. \"In my mind, is that affecting my readiness stress? No, it is not.\"\\n\\nThe Pentagon has spent a total of $292 million on the deployment, according to a seven-page Defense Department letter sent Tuesday to Rep. Anthony Brown, a Maryland Democrat, who requested additional information about the mission. The letter, obtained by TIME, states the estimated cost of Pentagon support is at least $431 million through this fiscal year.\\n\\nThe Pentagon is also on the hook to help shelter 5,000 migrant children caught crossing the U.S. southern border without a parent. It\\'s unclear where exactly the short-term detention camps will be, but the Defense Department identified Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas as a potential location last June for the growing number of migrants swept into the federal system due to the Administration\\'s \"zero tolerance\" policy.\\n\\nThe impending decision comes as new data released by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shows that unauthorized crossings, especially of family units, along the Mexico border had surged to record levels in recent months. Officials said Tuesday that 92,000 migrants were apprehended during a record-setting March. Of that total, 8,900 were unaccompanied minors -- a nearly 120% increase over March 2018.\\n\\nAs for the newly contracted border wall, plans are still in the earliest stages. The Army Corps of Engineers in recent weeks began drawing up assessments for 57 miles of 18-foot-high barrier in the towns, which have become the busy corridors for illegal crossings. The plan is to install 46 miles of barrier at Santa Teresa, which received six bids from prospective contractors, and 11 miles at Yuma, which received three bids.', 'source': {'uri': 'time.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TIME'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'w_j_hennigan@time.com', 'name': 'W.J.

Hip new hotels with Acropolis views are dotting the skyline. Construction workers are tearing into dwellings owned by Greeks needing cash and converting them swiftly to short-term rentals, Airbnbs or fancy new homes for foreigners.\\n\\nThousands of visa-seekers, a significant portion of them Chinese investors looking for bargain real estate, are coming to this capital city as well as the islands of Santorini and Corfu in search of homes that will give them a European base.\\n\\nLocal homeowners, pressed by Greece\\'s lengthy financial crisis, are trying to take advantage of the investor bonanza, selling apartments or renting their homes to tourists in a frenzy that is quickly changing the housing market.\\n\\nThe newcomers are chasing Greece\\'s so-called golden visas, which other crisis-hit countries like Portugal and Spain have used for years to lure investors in a bid to stoke an economic recovery. Spending a minimum of €250,000 on a home in Greece secures a five-year renewable visa.\\n\\nGreece is a latecomer to the global buying trend -- in part because its debt crisis was so dire in 2011 -- but it has become a hot destination for those with enough money. The government began offering golden visas in 2013, also drawing investors from Russia, Turkey and the Middle East.\\n\\nYet the turnaround is coming at a cost. While rising property prices benefit homeowners, renters are being priced out. Families still struggling to recover from the crisis are being pushed from working-class neighborhoods as the wrecking companies move in.\\n\\n\"It\\'s like what happened in Barcelona, where everyone was forced from the center,\" said Maria Dolores, a young artist who lived there before moving to Athens four years ago. She and three roommates were evicted from a €400-a-month rental in Athens in November as the landlord weighed converting it to an Airbnb or selling to a foreigner.\\n\\nCarrie Law, the chief executive of Juwai.com, a Hong Kong-based real estate investment group, said the country that once was an economic basket case has become a top destination for China\\'s middle class because of the golden visa program. Chinese feel comfortable going to Greece because big Chinese state-owned companies, including Cosco, which owns most of Greece\\'s Piraeus port, have already invested, she said.\\n\\nChinese clients often fly to Greece with suitcases filled with cash, the easiest way to get their money out of China, Ms. Law said. Although China caps individual withdrawals to $50,000 per year, a family of six, for example, can pool their cash, or make transfers through foreign branches of Chinese banks, to buy property, she said.\\n\\nGreece\\'s central bank has recently stepped up scrutiny of transactions after some Greek real estate companies were found allowing Chinese clients to buy properties with a credit card.\\n\\nProperty prices in the country are recovering from a 40 percent plunge that began in 2010. Greece nearly crashed out of the eurozone in 2015, but stability has slowly returned, reviving confidence and tourism, which boomed with a record 33 million visitors last year.\\n\\nBig investors, including Thomas Cook and Wyndham Hotels, are pouring billions into the tourism sector, and dozens of hotel and resort projects are opening or underway, according to Enterprise Greece, the government agency promoting investment and trade. \"We are seeing renewed investor confidence in Greece,\" said Grigoris Stergioulis, the agency head.\\n\\nPrivate equity funds are also investing in Greek real estate investment trusts. And some are starting to buy mortgage- or property-backed securities sold by Greek banks that are looking to unload piles of troubled mortgage loans accumulated during the crisis.\\n\\nGreece\\'s reliance on a bailout of over €320 billion, or about $360 billion, from the International Monetary Fund ended in 2018, and real estate prices rose by nearly 2 percent, the first increase in nine years, according to the Bank of Greece. Building permits jumped more than 10 percent, reversing a seven-year slump.\\n\\nReal estate investment grew in 2018 by around 20 percent from a year earlier.\\n\\nInvestors have tried to cash in partly by converting properties to lucrative short-term tourist rentals, which have quadrupled in five years, reducing the supply of affordable rental housing for average Greeks. A growing number of tourist rentals are listed on Airbnb, prompting the government to mull restrictions.\\n\\nArgiro Fouraci, 29, recently began renting five apartments that have been in her family for years. A teacher who lost her job during the crisis, she had struggled to get by until offering the apartments, in the popular Koukaki neighborhood near the Acropolis, as Airbnbs. She said she now clears about €400 per month on each apartment, after taxes and management fees.\\n\\nThe earnings help her care for her parents, who are in their 60s and whose pensions were slashed. They, in turn, support her brother, who has opened a vaping store. \"Most of my friends are still unemployed,\" she said. \"Now I can have a life and help my family.\"\\n\\nSuch business has lifted fortunes for Stavros Siempos, 53, the owner of Pantopolion, a grocery in Koukaki that sells feta cheese, olives and other traditional Greek products. The rise of Airbnb rentals has driven many Greeks from the neighborhood, he acknowledged. \"We don\\'t have Greek neighbors anymore, we have Airbnb neighbors,\" he said. But it is good for business, he added. \"We\\'re better off now, because tourists have money.\"\\n\\nAs Airbnb makes inroads into the country\\'s real estate, Greece\\'s golden visa program has opened its housing market -- and reshaped its pricing structure. A scan of property listings show many mid-sized apartments in Athens, Thessaloniki and on Greek islands are priced at exactly €250,000, the minimum needed for buyers to qualify for the visa program.\\n\\nThe program has drawn about 10,000 investors from China, Russia and other non-European Union countries, channeling around €1.5 billion into Greek real estate in the last five years, according to Enterprise Greece. Chinese investors account for more than 40 percent of visa buyers.\\n\\nDevelopers say that Chinese investment companies have bought apartment buildings throughout Athens, including in low-cost immigrant neighborhoods and once-rough areas like Exarchia, a graffiti-filled district populated mostly by university students.\\n\\nYannis Anastassiadis, chief executive of Anastassiadis Group, a real estate company that works with many Chinese investors, said companies typically renovate an apartment and then sell directly to clients seeking visas.\\n\\nReal estate agents arrange to meet groups of Chinese visitors at the Athens airport, drive them to view properties and wine and dine them. Lawyers work with the agents to help buyers acquire tax numbers and bank accounts. A buyer does not have to live in the property to qualify for a visa, so after the deal is done, Mr. Anastassiadis\\'s firm also manages the apartment as a rental.\\n\\nLefteris Potamianos, president of the Athens-Attica Real Estate Association, said the visas have helped revive the market and, in turn, pushed up rental costs in some areas by as much as 30 percent.\\n\\nActivists have warned that, when combined with the proliferation of Airbnb, a housing crisis is threatening entire communities.\\n\\nMs. Dolores, the artist who had to find a new home, said a foreign investor also bought a building that housed her employer, a nongovernmental organization. The group, AMOQA, conducts research and promotion of arts and studies on sexuality and gender. The building was also home to a martial arts school and a children\\'s activity center, she said.\\n\\n\"Now, the investment company will turn the building into apartments,\" Ms. Dolores said. \"Aside from people and families, collective spaces and neighborhood networks are also getting displaced and vanishing from the map.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s like a domino effect,\" she said. \"And the most vulnerable are losing out.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'liz_alderman@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Liz Alderman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/business/19grecon5/19grecon5-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 424}\n",

Fox News learned over the weekend that Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., wanted to have committee staff question Barr on his handling of the report.\\n\\nBut Barr wants lawmakers to do the questioning and, according to a source close to the committee, has said he will not come in to testify based on where things currently stand.\\n\\nBARR SPARS WITH NADLER, THREATENS TO SKIP TESTIMONY AFTER DISPUTE OVER HEARING FORMAT\\n\\n\"The Attorney General agreed to appear before Congress. Therefore, Members of Congress should be the ones doing the questioning,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told Fox News. \"He remains happy to engage with Members on their questions regarding the Mueller report.\"\\n\\nDiscussions are ongoing, and it\\'s unclear if they might reach a resolution. A spokesperson for committee Republicans called Democrats\\' demands \"abusive and illogical.\"\\n\\n\"Attorney General Barr wasn\\'t asked to testify before the committee -- he offered. He provided the Mueller report voluntarily. He invited Democrat leaders to view the less redacted report in person. Yet the only thing, apparently, that will satisfy Democrats, who refuse to read the less redacted report, is to have staff pinch hit when a cabinet-level official appears before us,\" the spokesperson said.\\n\\nIs it unusual for committee counsels to question a witness, but committees generally can make their own rules. Other panels have made similar exceptions.\\n\\nBarr has faced heated criticism since last month when he released an initial four-page summary of Mueller\\'s findings. Barr stated that the special counsel found no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Mueller also led an inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice in the investigation, but ultimately did not come to a conclusion on the matter. Instead, Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced that the evidence found in the probe was not sufficient to charge the president with an obstruction of justice offense.\\n\\nDemocrats have questioned that conclusion, especially after Barr released the nearly 500-page report recounting numerous incidents of Trump allegedly trying to curtail the probe. Democrats also objected to the redactions made in the report issued to the public.\\n\\nJIM JORDAN WARNS WHITE HOUSE OF POTENTIAL CUMMINGS CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST CARL KLINE\\n\\n\"He is attorney general of the United States of America, not the attorney general of Donald Trump,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said earlier this month.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a separate battle has developed over the testimony of ex-White House security official Carl Kline. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., subpoenaed Kline earlier this month to appear before the panel as part of its investigation into the issuing of security clearances at the White House. But last week, the White House blocked Kline\\'s testimony.\\n\\nThe White House told Kline to defy the subpoena and said Kline could not testify unless a member from the White House counsel\\'s office was present. The White House made that request to Cummings, but was denied.\\n\\nOn Friday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, warned the White House that Cummings could initiate contempt proceedings against Kline should he not appear. Jordan requested that Kline come for a transcribed interview with committee staff. A source close to Jordan told Fox News Friday that the move was \"in an attempt to get Kline\\'s testimony, not to head off contempt, but to de-escalate, respect the process, and get information.\"\\n\\nCUMMINGS SCHEDULES TESTIMONY FROM EX-WHITE HOUSE SECURITY OFFICIAL IN CLEARANCE PROBE\\n\\nThe White House has since opened the door to a limited interview. In a letter over the weekend, Cummings scheduled one for Wednesday morning but said the scope will not be limited -- and reiterated his contempt threat in stark terms.\\n\\n\"Based on the record before us, I am confident that the Committee could move forward with contempt against you immediately, particularly since your defiance of the Committee\\'s subpoena was so flagrant,\" Cummings wrote. \"... You will be expected to answer all of the Committee\\'s questions, including questions about specific White House officials and allegations of retaliation against the whistleblower. If you answer all of these questions, there would be no need for the Committee to pursue contempt against you in the future. This burden rests squarely with you, with the advice of your personal counsel, and not with White House attorneys who may direct you to disregard the Committee\\'s questions without an assertion of privilege.\"\\n\\nThe probe intensified after Tricia Newbold, an 18-year government employee who oversaw the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides, revealed that she compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year, but had senior officials overrule those denials.\\n\\nThe clash between the White House and Congress is escalating on other fronts as well. The president, last week, vowed to fight all subpoenas for current and former Trump administration officials.\\n\\n\"We\\'re fighting all of the subpoenas,\" Trump said last week. \"Look, these aren\\'t like, impartial people. They are Democrats trying to win in 2020. ...They\\'re not going to win against me.\"\\n\\nHe added that \"the only way they can luck out is by constantly going after me on nonsense.\"\\n\\nIn a separate push, top Democrats on several House committees launched an investigation into the massive shakeup in leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, citing allegations that the president removed top officials for refusing to carry out his desired immigration policies. The first witness the panels called was White House adviser Stephen Miller, but the White House blocked his testimony as well.\\n\\nWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone notified Cummings that Miller would decline the invitation, and instead, offered cabinet secretaries and other agency officials to appear instead.\\n\\nAlso last week, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn, whose testimony, likely related to Mueller\\'s obstruction inquiry, was also blocked by the White House.\\n\\nTrump, last week, called the McGahn subpoena \"ridiculous,\" and also touted his administration\\'s transparency.\\n\\n\"I let everybody testify. There\\'s never ever been transparency like this,\" Trump said. \"With all of this transparency, we finished.

Those were more innocent times.\\n\\nTrump, convinced he alone outwitted the deep state, is now unleashed to be a purer version of himself. He will listen even less to his aides, except the most servile, like the recently appointed Attorney General William Barr who followed directions perfectly with his No Collusion, No Collusion Summary of the Mueller Report, stopping just short of his boss declaring it \"bullsh*t.\" To all those who thought Trump would have brought in a lawyer that hadn\\'t passed his Roy Cohn test for abject loyalty, think again.\\n\\nWhat Barr doesn\\'t realize yet is that the White House is not Hollywood producer Mark Burnett\\'s Apprentice but his other hit show, Survivor, in which a group of strangers in an isolated setting compete for rewards and pray not to be eliminated. Trump stars in the presidential version in which he is always the Sole Survivor. Everyone else is voted off the island, soiled by the experience, and hard-pressed to re-enter polite society. All ye who work there might observe the job search of former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and consider getting out.\\n\\nThose left in the administration are the ones who give in to Trump\\'s worst impulses. This week saw an outpouring of nostalgia for former White House counsel Don McGahn for doing no more than what your run-of-the mill courthouse lawyer would in taking notes like a \"real lawyer\" despite Trump\\'s scolding, and refusing to fire Mueller. That was enough for Rudy Giuliani to emerge from the rock he\\'s been placed under to dismiss as fake news McGahn\\'s testimony under oath.\\n\\nOh, for the good old days. It\\'s a sign of just how much trouble we\\'re in that we make such a big deal over anyone who shows the slightest bit of spine. Those inside must dance with Trump in the end zone or look for a job on pre-dawn cable or a think tank funded by the Mercers.\\n\\nThe current acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is almost enough to induce nostalgia for those bygone co-chiefs Reince Prebius, the wimpy operative who felt \"blessed\" to be in the White House, and Steve Bannon, the angry white supremacist driven out for bad grooming. Mulvaney is a step down, debased like so many are under this president by the qualifier \"acting\" in his title, Trump\\'s management innovation that makes everyday audition day for a permanent job.\\n\\nTrump approved the dress rehearsal when Mulvaney kneecapped Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\'s Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, which in its pre-Mick days restored $12 billion to 300 million defrauded consumers. No fear of that happening on Mulvaney\\'s watch. For an encore, he removed pesky regulations from payday lenders whose business model is to bankrupt workers living from paycheck to paycheck.\\n\\nMulvaney whimpered to ABC\\'s Jonathan Karl when asked when he\\'d get the real job that Trump \"enjoys having me\" around. In that same interview we learned why. He parroted Trump as if hoping for a cracker. He railed against Mueller, cheered Trump\\'s impulsive decision to kill Obamacare, and was on board to shut down the southern border, such a potentially staggering blow to the economy other enablers in the Administration threw their bodies in front of it. At Trump\\'s behest, Mulvaney had dutifully defended cutting Special Olympics out of the budget. When the outrage grew intolerable, Trump acted like he\\'d nothing to do with such a boneheaded idea.\\n\\nSarah Huckabee Sanders remains every bit as pliant as Mulvaney. A smoother liar than her predecessor Sean Spicer, who had the decency to wince slightly when he said Trump had the biggest inaugural crowd ever, Sanders told whoppers daily until Trump decided he could tell them much better himself. With his impromptu driveway pressers, he\\'s become his own press secretary.\\n\\nBut she will always have a place in Trump\\'s heart for eluding Mueller. Sure, under penalty of perjury she had to own up to her whopper about how she knew everyone from Congress to rank and file FBI agents thrilled that Trump had fired Director James Comey. But she couldn\\'t help but tell a lie about the lie, blaming her slip of the tongue on the \"heat of the moment.\" A review of the briefing tape shows Sanders at the podium cooly telling that tall tale from prepared notes. Mueller couldn\\'t charge all the lying liars or we\\'d still be awaiting his report.\\n\\nStill at work is Stephen Miller, the bootleg telenovela border hawk who will never refuse an order and sometimes gives them. He\\'s all in on Trump\\'s desperate attempt to appease wall enthusiasts Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh, who Trump played a celebratory round of golf with Friday.\\n\\nWithout adult supervision, team Miller just got approval from Justice to hold those trying to make an asylum claim outside ports of entry until their hearing, which could be years, or corral them in Mexico. He\\'s aiming to flood Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s San Francisco and other so-called sanctuary cities with Central American immigrants. Not to scare anyone but the troops Trump ordered to the border are still there. General Mattis at least ordered them not to shoot anyone who didn\\'t shoot them first, but that\\'s not how Miller rolls.\\n\\nJust this week came news that armed vigilantes calling themselves United Constitutional Patriots have been rounding up migrants at gunpoint. Don\\'t expect Trump to do anything about it having pardoned famous Vigilante-Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who forced imprisoned immigrants to wear pink underwear while picking up trash on Arizona highways.\\n\\nBarr may have already done the one job he was hired for, but he remains the attorney general of Trump\\'s fevered dreams, one who puts Trump first, America second. He already proved that with his shocking talk of a coming investigation on imaginary spying on Trump during his 2016 campaign.\\n\\nYou\\'d never know Mueller and Barr worked for the same Department of Justice, as Barr argued only for Trump: that Mueller didn\\'t charge Trump with obstruction of justice, not because Justice Department guidelines say he can\\'t, but because the president didn\\'t obstruct, which Mueller proves he did. And in the alternative, if there was any obstruction, it was justifiable because Trump was understandably \"frustrated,\" at the unfairness of it all, a novel defense not found in law school or nursery school.\\n\\nBarr\\'s branding of the Mueller report that produced cover headlines like the New York Post\\'s \"Trump Clean\" is the moment in the movie when you find out the police captain is on the take but why? Like Rudy Giuliani, does he miss the klieg lights, was he bored by his corporate clients, or could he possibly believe it was all a witch hunt perpetrated by fake news and the deep state?\\n\\nThe White House promised a written rebuttal of the Mueller report only to abruptly cancel it. Who needs it when Barr did it for them?\\n\\nWith \"Trump Clean\" and 2020 looming, we\\'re finally going to see the president unbound.

On Friday morning, Fox & Friends welcomed \"social media superstars and Fox Nation contributors\" Diamond and Silk to discuss climate change and immigration, and if you\\'d rather just skip ahead to the part where you bang your head against your desk, I won\\'t blame you.\\n\\nIn case you don\\'t feel like losing five minutes of your one precious life to something that will make you noticeably more stupid, here\\'s the gist: Diamond and Silk got airtime on a national cable news network to make the claim that climate change is real, but it is to be expected because our planet is rotating very quickly, every single day of the year.\\n\\nThe climate is indeed changing, but, according to Diamond and Silk, it\\'s not due to the pollution we\\'re spewing into the sky. It\\'s not carbon or methane. It is, I guess, friction, and the purpose of the Green New Deal is to literally stop the Earth from turning, and reset it. This is a thing that was said on television this very morning, and your Dad watched it, and so did the president of the United States, and all of them echoed Silk\\'s assessment: \"Mm-hmm.\"\\n\\nThe hosts then turned their attention to Beto O\\'Rourke, who at a recent campaign event called President Trump out for painting Mexicans as \"rapists\" and asylum seekers as \"animals.\" Asked to respond to O\\'Rourke, Diamond said this, and I am not kidding: \"When I listen to Beto O\\'Rourke, his rhetoric, it reminds me of a slave owner. Anytime you want to tear down existing walls, and allow poor people to flow into our country, and have them living in the shadows, working for slave wages, that makes you a slave owner.\"\\n\\nIf you were wondering whether they mentioned our president, who continues to benefit from cheap, undocumented labor at his hotels and golf clubs, just kidding, you weren\\'t wondering that. \"Beto O\\'Rourke need to look at himself,\" said Diamond. \"And his own rhetoric,\" Silk chimed in. \"Right. Is what he need to do,\" Diamond concluded, over a chyron promising even more of this on Fox Nation, for just $5.99 a month.\\n\\nFox News -- really, cable news in general -- is not the place for deep and nuanced thought, but \"climate change is because the Earth is speeding\" and \"immigration reform is slavery\" are both alarmingly stupid ideas. And once again, there is a one-hundred percent chance the president is watching and nodding along.\\n\\nAll of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don\\'t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a post on his blog The Resurgent about rising Democratic Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is an observant Christian who supports a woman\\'s right to make her own reproductive decisions, and he recently called out the religious right for \"saying so much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.\" Pretty much every other Democratic Presidential hopeful holds this view; all are pro-choice, nearly all claim to be Christian. So it is interesting that only the first-ever openly gay one gets to be the subject of this headline:\\n\\nMayor Pete Buttigieg Apparently Thinks Jesus Would Be Okay With Bestiality.\\n\\nThe claim itself is too ignorant to put any energy into rebutting, but it does bear pointing out to my right-wing gay grifters out there: this is what they think of you. Whether you try to fit into their definition of respectable or not, even if you go on Tucker Carlson and eat a Chick-Fil-A sandwich, when push comes to shove, you\\'re no better than a goat-fucker.\\n\\nIs everything getting dumber, or are we just dizzy because the world is spinning so fast?', 'source': {'uri': 'esquire.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Esquire'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'dave_holmes@esquire.com', 'name': 'Dave Holmes', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2019-04-05-at-12-44-27-pm-1554482685.png?crop=1.00xw:0.684xh;0,0.0622xh&resize=640:*', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 392}\n",

But instead of his customary stop to take a few questions from reporters, he silently waved and boarded the presidential helicopter.\\n\\nIt was First Lady Melania Trump\\'s idea to spurn the press as Trump sought to show defiance after Mueller\\'s report, people briefed on the matter said. But his vindication over Mueller and Attorney General William Barr clearing him of criminal liability is giving way to anger. People close to him are worried Trump has begun to stew over news coverage of the report, which has focused on Mueller\\'s documentation of the president\\'s efforts to interfere in the investigation and deceive the public about his actions.\\n\\nTrump issued two tweets on Friday in which he used a profanity to describe some of Mueller\\'s findings.\\n\\nPeople close to him hope he realizes that the report isn\\'t crippling and the negative stories will largely end by Monday. But there are fresh concerns that Mueller\\'s revelations could damage his image with moderate swing voters who approve of Trump\\'s handling of the economy but are turned off by his unpredictable, unpresidential style, one White House aide said.\\n\\nOther advisers hope that Democrats overplay their hand, similar to the Republican effort to impeach President Bill Clinton, allowing Trump to continue to portray the investigation as a political vendetta. The people interviewed for this story asked not be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\\n\\nTrump and the White House acted indifferent to the report on Thursday. After musing that he might hold a news conference the day before, he took no questions from reporters. Trump\\'s legal team issued an initial statement on Mueller\\'s report but decided not to publish a fuller counter-report they had spent months compiling to rebut the special counsel.\\n\\n\"We do not feel the need to issue any additional reports,\" Trump\\'s lawyer Jay Sekulow said in an email. \"We are pleased that the special counsel matter has been concluded.\"\\n\\nWhite House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway called Thursday the \"best day since he got elected.\"\\n\\nAt Palm Beach International Airport Thursday evening, a smiling president greeted supporters, signing \"MAGA\" ballcaps and telling them \"thank you\" many times. He again ignored questions shouted by reporters traveling with him. He golfed with Rush Limbaugh on Friday.\\n\\nBut the president\\'s irritation grew as he watched coverage of the report Friday morning. He and his allies are particularly angry with former White House Counsel Don McGahn and former Staff Secretary Rob Porter, both of whom spoke extensively with Mueller. McGahn painted a detailed picture of Trump\\'s many attempts to interfere in the investigation, while Porter recounted several unflattering scenes from Trump\\'s presidency.\\n\\nSeveral advisers wondered whether Trump allies will seek retribution against the two former aides.\\n\\nMany of the events Mueller chronicled were reported contemporaneously in the news media and declared \"fake news\" by the president at the time. That claim is less credible following the Justice Department\\'s release of Mueller\\'s report, since people he interviewed could be charged with perjury if they weren\\'t truthful. Many of them corroborated their accounts with notes or other materials.\\n\\nThe report chronicled in detail at least 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice, including \"discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons.\" At times, Trump was stymied by aides who refused to act on his orders.\\n\\n\"The president\\'s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,\" Mueller wrote.\\n\\nBut there was also a sense of relief among White House aides yesterday; the investigation is behind them, and the worst-case scenario -- the indictment of Trump or members of his family -- didn\\'t come to pass.

Staring up at him from the entryway was a copy of The New York Post, with a picture of the World Trade Center in flames on the cover and a headline attacking a Muslim member of Congress, Ilhan Omar.\\n\\n\"It was disgusting. It was racist. I couldn\\'t believe this racist thing was sitting at my store,\" said Mr. Almuntaser, 29, who owns four bodegas in the city. \"The very next day, I told everyone who works at my stores not to accept the paper.\"\\n\\nHe was not alone, and a boycott of The New York Post began.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, Yemeni-Americans have established a foothold in New York\\'s network of bodegas, small convenience stores offering coffee, groceries and knickknacks to New Yorkers as loyal to their borough as they are to their neighborhood bodega.\\n\\nAnd now, they are increasingly trying to organize themselves to channel their economic power into political influence.\\n\\nThough Yemeni-American bodega owners first became politically active after the Sept. 11 attacks, they have become more vocal defenders of New York\\'s Muslim-American community since President Trump took office.\\n\\nIn 2017, Yemeni-American bodega owners closed their shops for a day and rallied in Downtown Brooklyn against Mr. Trump\\'s Muslim travel ban, which separated some Yemeni husbands in New York from wives and children abroad.\\n\\nAfter The New York Post cover was published on April 11, the community\\'s two-year-old trade association, the Yemeni American Merchant Association (YAMA), again called for action.\\n\\nThe association asked Yemeni-American bodega owners in the city to stop selling The Post until it issues an apology to Ms. Omar and Muslim-Americans in New York. Of the roughly 10,000 bodegas in the city, YAMA estimated that around 4,000 to 6,000 are owned by Yemeni-Americans.\\n\\n\"We have the power and tools to do something about this. We have thousands of stores which, from an economic perspective, can make an impact,\" said Rabyaah Althaibani, a Yemeni-American organizer and member of YAMA.\\n\\nThe New York Post declined to comment on the criticism of the cover and the boycott, including whether it has had an impact on sales of the newspaper.\\n\\nThe Post cover said, \"Here\\'s your something. 2,977 people dead by terrorism,\" a jibe at Ms. Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, in response to a comment that she made about the Sept. 11 attacks that her supporters have said was misconstrued.\\n\\nThe Yemeni-Americans bodega owners expressed concern that the provocative imagery of the World Trade Centers in flames could trigger violence against Muslim-Americans in New York -- a fear they say has been more pronounced in the community since Mr. Trump was elected.\\n\\n\"They are propagating hate and they don\\'t care what the outcome is, they don\\'t realize the magnitude of the hate they are spreading,\" said Husam Kaid, 19, who works part time at his family\\'s bodega in Midtown.\\n\\nStill, the Yemeni-American bodega owners are not united over using their economic power to boycott The Post.\\n\\nSome said they were concerned that Yemeni-Americans could face repercussions for becoming the face of protest against a conservative news outlet owned by Rupert Murdoch.\\n\\n\"If the bodega becomes the symbol of such a struggle, it\\'s not far-fetched to see Yemeni bodega owners in Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi -- in unfriendly states -- being targeted with violence. The store could become the target before the mosque,\" said Zaid Nagi, 37, former vice president of the Yemeni American Merchants Association and a co-owner of a bodega in the Bronx.\\n\\nYemeni immigrants, many who lost their jobs in steel factories across the United States during the industry\\'s decline, began flocking to New York City in the 1950s. They soon adopted the stretches of streets around Downtown Brooklyn as their own, with Atlantic Avenue and Court Street in Brooklyn Heights their primary meeting points.\\n\\n\"Every kid back in our town in Yemen knows the names \\'Court Street\\' and \\'Atlantic Avenue\\' even before they even know where New York City is on a map,\" said Ibraham Qatabi, a Yemeni activist in Brooklyn.\\n\\nGrocery stores offering spices and gossip from the old country sprang up around the neighborhood. They were stocked with goods on ships coming from Aden, a port in Yemen, which also carried more Yemeni immigrants to New York.\\n\\nThe business of corner stores became the business of choice for many Yemeni immigrants, though they preferred calling them delis or convenience stores rather than the Spanish word, bodega, that came to be used for these mini-marts.\\n\\n\"People would come here from Yemen and start working in their relative\\'s grocery store and they would learn the business, and then go out and start their own grocery store and it kept growing like that,\" said Nasser Qatabi, 68, one of the first Yemeni real estate moguls in Brooklyn.\\n\\nOne recent morning in Mr. Almuntaser\\'s bodega on Bond Street in Brooklyn, construction workers, teachers and passers-by slipped through the open door to his shop, buying gum, cigarettes and soda from the two aisles of overstocked shelves.\\n\\n\"I like to think this place is more than just a bodega -- people don\\'t come here just to buy things,\" Mr. Almuntaser said. \"They come in because they feel comfortable here, they feel comfortable with me and we treat everyone well because we know them. I grew up a block away.

This system leads to exploitative labor practices, which affect marginalized groups disproportionately.\"\\n\\n- TOXIC MASCULINITY: \"Masculinity as defined by violence, sexual acts, status, aggression, and the oppression of others. Toxic masculinity hurts everyone, including cisgender men. It is characterized with rigid gender roles and expectations that are often violently enforced. Men are unable to express or feel emotion, and the fear of being deemed in proximity to being gay or a woman is constant threat.\"\\n\\n- REVERSE OPPRESSION: \"There is no such thing as reverse oppression.

After about five years, the couple began searching for a larger home.\\n\\n\"We looked at other towns, but discovered we had fallen in love with Parsippany and wanted to stay,\" said Ms. Pacan, 36, a corporate trainer in the financial industry. (Although the township\\'s official name includes a reference to the neighborhood of Troy Hills, it is often referred to simply as Parsippany.)\\n\\nThey appreciated the friends they had made, as well as the township\\'s cultural diversity -- about a third of the population is Asian, and there is a large Hispanic community -- and its open space, which gives them plenty of room to walk their dogs and ride bikes.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a nice balance: You\\'re away from the city, but not in the middle of nowhere,\" said Mr. Simon, 34, a web developer and video producer.

Soriano, 51, a former electrician who now serves full-time as the mayor of Parsippany. The township is updating its master plan, and Mr. Soriano said he hopes the new plan will address traffic problems.\\n\\nBut many residents don\\'t have to commute far; they work in Morris County\\'s many corporate offices.\\n\\n\"A lot of people come here for their jobs,\" said Triveni Gurikar, a RE/MAX agent who has been selling Parsippany real estate since 1987.\\n\\nA number of those corporate offices are in Parsippany, including the headquarters of the Avis Budget Group and the roofing manufacturer GAF. And Teva Pharmaceutical Industries recently announced it was moving its American headquarters to Parsippany, from Pennsylvania.\\n\\nStill, the office vacancy rate is more than 20 percent, reflecting the soft office market across northern New Jersey. One empty complex, on Route 10, is being redeveloped into a retail and residential complex, Mr. Soriano said.\\n\\nParth Parikh, 27, grew up in Parsippany with his brother and parents, who emigrated from India in 1987. He has fond memories of playing street hockey and cricket in the Intervale Gardens apartment complex with friends of various backgrounds -- Colombian, Italian, Polish, African-American -- many of them also from immigrant families.\\n\\n\"So many different families welcomed me and exposed me to their cultures, and they came over to my house to eat chicken tikka masala,\" he said.\\n\\nMr. Parikh is now attending law school at the University of Notre Dame, in Indiana, but hopes eventually to return to Parsippany, where his parents own a townhouse.\\n\\n\"Growing up in a diverse town, you appreciate different perspectives and learning from other people,\" he said.\\n\\nWhat You\\'ll Find\\n\\nParsippany-Troy Hills is Morris County\\'s most populous township, with about 53,000 residents spread over 25 square miles, in the eastern part of the county. (In an odd quirk, some of those residents have Morris Plains ZIP codes, but technically live in Parsippany.) The population exploded in the 1960s, during the post-World War II suburban building boom, so many of the homes date to that era, with plenty of Cape Cods, split-levels and ranches.\\n\\nBut one of the most picturesque areas is Mount Tabor, which was founded 100 years earlier, in 1869, as a Methodist camp meeting, drawing visitors for short summer stays in tents. Now Victorian homes line the narrow, hilly streets of the neighborhood, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\nOther areas, including Lake Hiawatha and Lake Parsippany, were developed as summer retreats. Small cottages in these lake neighborhoods generally start at around $250,000, but many of the original homes have been expanded, or knocked down and replaced.\\n\\nWhat You\\'ll Pay\\n\\nHome prices generally start at about $150,000 for a one-bedroom condo in a converted garden apartment complex and can go over $1 million for the largest houses.\\n\\nAs of April 20, there were about 130 properties listed for sale, from a two-bedroom cottage for $127,000 to a six-bedroom house for $1.5 million.\\n\\nThe median home price was $405,000 for the 12 months ending on April 1, up 1.3 percent from the previous 12 months, Ms. Gurikar said, citing data from the Garden State Multiple Listing Service. And the market has gained momentum this spring, she added, with a number of homes selling for more than the asking price.\\n\\nParsippany also has some 7,800 rental units, many in garden complexes, where rents generally start at around $1,200 for a one-bedroom.\\n\\nThe Vibe\\n\\nParsippany\\'s retail businesses, including a Target, a Home Depot and a movie theater, mostly cluster in strip malls along busy Route 46. While that makes shopping convenient for residents, Route 46 is not a cozy downtown where you bump into your neighbors on the sidewalk.\\n\\n\"It appears like it was planned for vehicles, not for pedestrians or bicycles,\" Mr. Soriano said.\\n\\nBut on North Beverwyck Road, in the Lake Hiawatha neighborhood, there is a small shopping district with a drugstore, deli, comic book store and ice cream shop. The township recently received a Walkable Community Workshop grant from the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority to look at ways to make that area more pedestrian-friendly, Mr. Soriano said.\\n\\nBecause the township is large and divided by highways, some residents said they get their sense of connection within their neighborhoods, rather than from the township as a whole. Andrea Martone, an agent with Realty Executives Platinum, who grew up in the Lake Parsippany neighborhood, said, \"When you\\'re in a lake community, that feels more like a tight-knit community.\"\\n\\nStill, civic leaders make an effort to bring everyone together with township-wide events, including an annual Flavors of India celebration that recognizes Parsippany\\'s large Indian community.\\n\\nThe township has a number of popular Chinese and Indian restaurants, including Shan Shan Noodles, Noodle Wong, Spice Grill, Tandoori Flames and Chand Palace.\\n\\nOutdoor activities include golf at the Knoll Country Club and hiking through Troy Meadows, a 3,100-acre wildlife preserve.\\n\\nThe Schools\\n\\nThe Parsippany-Troy Hills school district serves about 7,000 students from prekindergarten through 12th grade. The district has 10 elementary schools, two middle schools and two high schools, Parsippany High School and Parsippany Hills High School.\\n\\nAverage SAT scores for the two high schools in 2017-2018 were 583 in reading and writing and 598 in mathematics, compared with statewide averages of 542 and 543. About 90 percent of graduates go on to further education, and 75 percent attend four-year colleges.\\n\\nThe Commute\\n\\nParsippany is about 30 miles west of Times Square, in Manhattan. The Lakeland Bus Lines bus 46 takes about 60 to 65 minutes to get to the Port Authority Bus Terminal; the fare is $11.35 one way, or $95.45 for 10 trips.\\n\\nCommuters can also drive to train stations in neighboring Denville or Morris Plains, which have New Jersey Transit rail service to New York Penn Station. From Morris Plains, the trip takes about 70 minutes, and costs $15, or $436 for a monthly pass.\\n\\nAs Parsippany is crisscrossed by highways, commuters who drive have several options, including Interstate 80, Route 10 and Route 46, which run east-west across the township, and Interstate 287, which runs north-south. The drive to New York City can take an hour or two during rush hour, depending on traffic.\\n\\nThe History\\n\\nThe Arts and Crafts designer Gustav Stickley built a log house on the western edge of Parsippany in the early 20th century. The property, which he was forced to sell in 1917 after declaring bankruptcy, is now a 30-acre park and historic landmark known as the Stickley Museum at Craftsman Farms.\\n\\nFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]\\n\\nBROWNSVILLE, Tex. -- Homar Veloz lives in South Texas, but on the wrong side of the border wall -- separated from the rest of the United States by a long line of vertical steel bars standing up to 18 feet high.\\n\\nHis house on the 1600 block of Milpa Verde is located in an odd swath of Brownsville, Tex., that runs between the border wall and the Rio Grande -- a netherworld that is officially still America but which somehow got left on the Mexican side of the wall.\\n\\nVisitors often get confused, including Mr. Veloz\\'s daughter, who was nervous the first time she visited the house, and reminded him that she hadn\\'t brought her passport.\\n\\n\"She said, \\'Dad, don\\'t tell me we\\'re in Mexico,\\'\" he recalled. \"Because she\\'d gone past the fence.\"\\n\\nOne of his neighbors made a homemade billboard that she posted at the end of her driveway to make things clear: \"We\\'re Part of America.\"\\n\\nOn long stretches of the Southwest border, a clearly visible boundary separates the United States and Mexico. In parts of Southern California and in the Arizona desert, it takes the shape of a wall running right along the line, with one country on each side.\\n\\nBut in South Texas, things get fuzzy. The border there, by tradition and international treaty, is the Rio Grande, and no one has yet figured out how to build a border wall in the middle of a river. As a result, the fence that elsewhere would trace the southern edge of the United States can run, as it does in Mr. Veloz\\'s neighborhood, more than a mile north of the river.\\n\\nThat has created an oddly isolated zone of homes, ranchland, industrial sites and nature preserves that locals call a no man\\'s land, between the barrier and the border -- a place that dozens of Texans call home.\\n\\nPresident Trump\\'s border security plans call for miles of new border fencing in South Texas, much of it in the Rio Grande Valley, which has emerged as a key corridor for unauthorized migration into the United States. The border wall proposal has raised questions about cost and effectiveness across the country, but one of the biggest issues here in Texas is the way the plan would significantly add to the buffer zone, a bizarre region that has amused, angered and isolated the people who live and work there.\\n\\n\"It was a bunch of yo-yos up in D.C.,\" said Cuban A. Monsees Jr., 71, who lives north of the fence, not far from Mr. Veloz, but owns more than four acres on the south side. \"It should be closer to the river, No. 1,\" Mr. Monsees said of the fence. \"Where it should have been was within 150 feet of the river bank, rather than, in some cases, a mile and a half away.\"\\n\\nThis netherworld between the end of Mexico and the visible beginning of the United States is a subtly off-kilter place unlike any other in America.\\n\\nResidents, property owners and ranch hands in South Texas gain access through dozens of openings and gates, in many cases by punching in secret access codes on a keypad. One household south of the fence in Brownsville put its mailbox on the north side, presumably to make life easier for the letter carrier.\\n\\nThe pace is slow, the property cheap: Mr. Veloz rents his house for $350 a month. Another resident doesn\\'t have a mailbox because the mail never comes, and burns his trash because the refuse collector never shows up.\\n\\nThe fencing that created the netherworld went up during the George W. Bush administration, but limitations on where the fence could be constructed are much older.\\n\\nA treaty signed by the United States and Mexico in 1970, and later ratified under President Richard Nixon, to resolve some boundary disputes also prohibits construction of anything that would obstruct the normal flow of the Rio Grande. It applies not only to the river\\'s main channel, but also adjacent lands, hence the decision to keep the fencing well clear of the river.\\n\\nThe fencing was intended to help keep out drug smugglers and unauthorized migrants. But in some ways it has complicated the Trump administration\\'s attempts to halt the waves of migrant families from Central America who have been crossing the border recently. Those who cross in the Rio Grande Valley do not have to breach a border wall to claim asylum, because they reach United States soil and gain that right as soon as they have crossed the river. So for them, the situation is no different than it would be if there were no wall or fence at all.\\n\\nA number of legal battles have broken out between the Trump administration and property owners along the river, over the government\\'s plans for additional barriers north of the river that would cut off and fragment ranches, nature centers and historical landmarks.\\n\\nLife on the south side of the Bush-era fence has been difficult for the nonprofit Nature Conservancy. It owns the Southmost Preserve near Brownsville, a nesting habitat for rare birds and the site of one of the last two large stands of native sabal palm trees in the country. Most of the preserve -- 831 of its 1,014 acres -- is south of the fence.\\n\\nAt one time, a preserve manager lived in a house on the site, and many donors and researchers visited or even stayed overnight. But after the wall was built in 2009, slicing through the preserve, the live-in manager was moved out for safety reasons, and visits by donors and researchers dwindled. There have also been negative ecological impacts, including disruptions to the free movement of ocelots, an endangered species.\\n\\nThe federal government initially offered the Nature Conservancy roughly $100,000 for a right of way through the preserve, but the group sued and was awarded nearly $1 million -- less than one-third of the $3.1 million it spent to purchase the preserve.\\n\\n\"Visitation in general is not what it was,\" said Laura Huffman, the Nature Conservancy\\'s state director. \"It\\'s changed the story about the preserve. One hundred percent of the time now the conversation about Southmost Preserve is not about sabal palms and habitat protection for the ocelot. It\\'s about a border wall, and that\\'s not our conservation work.\"\\n\\nIn some ways, this region is not unlike other rural parts of Texas. There are vast, carefully maintained fields of corn and sugar cane, horse stalls, dirt roads, power lines and tail-swishing cattle. There are radio towers and quaint ponds and houses with swimming pools and unleashed dogs chasing passing vehicles.\\n\\nBrownsville officials say Mr. Veloz and his neighbors on Milpa Verde are provided the same municipal services as any other residents.\\n\\n\"Our response times are not affected,\" said Jarrett Sheldon, chief of the Brownsville Fire Department. \"People on the other side of the wall, they\\'re going to get the same response.\"\\n\\nResidents south of the fence don\\'t need to rely solely on Brownsville emergency responders for their security, in any case: They live in one of the most heavily patrolled communities in the country. Border Patrol agents come through regularly in vehicles and helicopters, along with sheriff\\'s deputies, constables and state troopers. Cameras are mounted high atop the fence, many of them aimed at the openings and gates, and residents have long grown accustomed to being photographed and filmed as they travel to and from their homes.\\n\\nMr. Veloz said it all makes him feel safer. Migrants and smugglers are a common sight. Years ago, he said, people used to knock on his door at night. \"I wouldn\\'t answer,\" he said, \"because I don\\'t know what their intentions are.\"\\n\\nBeing Texans, though, many of the people who live between the fence and the river say they don\\'t count exclusively on the government to keep them safe. One recent afternoon, a retired refrigerator repairman wearing camouflage clothing strolled south of the wall with a handgun in a holster on his hip. Mr. Monsees was even more heavily armed as he spoke outside his home while sitting in his pickup truck.\\n\\n\"This is a single-shot .410, and that\\'s a single-shot .22, and I keep the pistol between the seats,\" he said.\\n\\nIn another buffer-zone community along the river about 50 miles northwest of Brownsville, on a muddy dirt road outside the town of Donna, Arturo Munoz, 72, sat in the carport of his house just south of the border fence, sipping a Bud Light. His dog Max lay at his feet.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just about the same as on the north side,\" said Mr. Munoz, a retired welder and Vietnam veteran, though he conceded that he has no mail service, no landline telephone and no cable television.\\n\\nHe said he bought the property nearly 15 years ago because he grew up nearby and feels a connection to the area. When it came time to build the border fence, he said, the government made him an offer he could refuse, and he did. He stayed put, and the wall went up just north of his white-brick home, right behind a line of trees in his back yard.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lot safer than in town,\" he said. \"I lived in town. I was renting, and got broke into three times.\"\\n\\nHe described riding his bicycle near his house one day and seeing a few migrants walking along. He said he waved to them and pedaled on. They had crossed the river on their journey to America, and had found it.

Currently, Spring Fertility employs five different providers that include a first-generation immigrant from Vietnam, a Hispanic woman, an African-American man (Dr. Harris), an African-American woman, and a \"token white guy,\" as they put it with some humor. \"Our mission is to help everyone have the family of their dreams, irrespective of gender, race, or sexual orientation,\" Dr. Harris said.\\n\\nOther direct-to-consumer fertility startups are trying to expand who can access fertility services. This could help people in diverse demographics seek treatment earlier. Modern Fertility is one such startup that wants to help women get the same basic tests you would get at a fertility clinic without ever having to go to one. You simply go to the Modern Fertility website and purchase a test for $150. A doctor then reviews the order and assigns a personalized test you can take at home or at your local Quest Diagnostics lab. If you take it at home, you can send the test back via mail. Then, a doctor will review your results before posting them online. After that, you have access to a doctor and online community to discuss your results and the best next steps. The main thing the Modern Fertility test looks for is your AMH levels, which can give you an idea of how many eggs you have left. They\\'ll also provide a Fertility Measurement Index (FEMI), with the hope of giving you a better sense of your fertility than your age alone can.\\n\\n\"We think education is for everyone,\" explained Dr. Nataki Douglas MD, PhD, and chair of the Modern Fertility Medical Advisory Board. \"All women should be able to get access to this basic and important information about their body so they can be their own best personal health advocates,\" she said. By giving women a more personalized and specific look into their own fertility picture, Modern Fertility could help women avoid expensive fertility treatments down the road. For example, a woman in her late 20s who shows a low number of eggs for her age may decide to start trying to conceive naturally now.\\n\\nDadi is another company trying to remove barriers for fertility services, but for men. It\\'s created a $99 at-home male fertility test kit that is easier and cheaper than traditional options. For $99 more per year it will store your sperm, too. \"Since launch, we\\'ve shipped Dadi kits all throughout the US and we\\'re going to continue to spread awareness and education about male infertility,\" Dadi cofounder and CEO Tom Smith told me. Affordable tests like the ones offered by Modern Fertility and Dadi could reduce the barrier to entry for fertility treatment and help close the information and access gap.

His first target is health care. \"We\\'re going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump said at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday. \"And I said the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It\\'s good. It\\'s important.\"\\n\\nTo that end, Trump directed the Justice Department on Monday to seek the invalidation of the entire law, backing a federal district judge in Texas who declared it unconstitutional late last year.\\n\\nUnraveling the Affordable Care Act would deal a catastrophic blow to the safety net. The health exchanges and new insurance regulations? Gone. Medicaid expansion, which even in its truncated form has reached people in 36 states? Gone. The host of protections for people who get health care through jobs and private insurers? Gone. Republican elites might cheer this destruction, but soon enough they would face millions of voters who pulled levers in 2016 believing that Trump and the Republican Party would protect them.\\n\\nRemember, Trump did not run for president as an orthodox conservative Republican. He embraced social programs and so-called entitlements, rejecting the party\\'s boilerplate on government and the economy. \"I\\'m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I\\'m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\" he said during the campaign. Elaborating on health care, he told CBS News that \"everybody\\'s got to be covered,\" which he called an \"un-Republican thing\" to say. \"I am going to take care of everybody,\" he added. \"I don\\'t care if it costs me votes or not.\"\\n\\nThis rhetoric mattered. Trump\\'s victory hinged on a group of voters supportive of programs like Social Security and Medicare but hostile toward Hispanic immigrants, Muslims and black Americans. These voters were cross-pressured: They were both opposed to conservative anti-government ideology and repelled by racial and cultural liberalism.\\n\\nTrump relieved that pressure. He embraced the welfare state and demonized racial and religious minorities, attracting the most racially resentful whites from across the political spectrum. The substantial minority of Democrats who believed that \"discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and other minorities\" could back a Republican presidential candidate without sacrificing their support for signature Democratic programs. They could indulge their racial chauvinism without jeopardizing their other priorities.\\n\\nA disciplined Trump could have reshaped the Republican Party\\'s agenda to meet the economic concerns of its increasingly blue-collar base, sidelining the anti-government conservatism of figures like the former speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, or Senator Ted Cruz. There was a glimpse of this at the start of his term, from an Inaugural Address devoted to \"the forgotten men and women of our country\" to the promise of \"economic nationalism\" from Steve Bannon, then the president\\'s \"chief strategist.\"\\n\\nInstead, Trump ceded most of his domestic agenda to the most conservative Republicans, with Ryan and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell taking the lead in Congress and a cadre of ideologues shaping policy in and outside the White House. Out was Trump\\'s health care for everyone; in was an aggressive effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and unravel Medicaid. Out was a $1 trillion infrastructure project; in was a nearly $2 trillion tax cut weighted toward large corporations and wealthy individuals.\\n\\nKey officials have moved the administration even further to the right. As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney wrote proposals with deep, destructive cuts to the social safety net. Now working as White House chief of staff, he appears to be the driving force behind this new attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He persuaded Trump to join a lawsuit by Republican attorneys general to invalidate the law, reportedly over the objections of Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, and Attorney General William Barr, who will have to carry out the effort.\\n\\nBut while Trump\\'s decision to govern for conservatives has netted him high approval ratings with Republicans who remain loyal to him, it has also undermined the coalition that put him in the White House, threatening his prospects for re-election.\\n\\nWe saw some of this with the midterms. The drive to repeal Obamacare was a major reason Republicans lost their majority in the House of Representatives. The attempt made Trump\\'s approval rating plunge to the mid-30s, lower than that of other presidents at that point in their first term. Large majorities opposed the bill to repeal and replace the health care law, and 60 percent said it was a \"good thing\" it failed to pass. Forty-two percent of voters named health care as their top issue in the midterms, and 77 percent of them backed Democrats.\\n\\nIn 2016, Trump ran without the burden of a record. He could be everything to everyone -- he could say what people wanted to hear. And he used that to reach out to working-class whites as a moderate on the economy and a hard-line conservative on race and immigration.\\n\\nNow, as president, Trump is a standard-issue Republican with an almost total commitment to conservative economic policy. Those policies are unpopular. And they have created an opening for Democrats to win back some of the voters they\\'ve lost.\\n\\nSpeaking to The Washington Post, Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor who became an early Trump ally, summarized the conventional wisdom after Robert Mueller cleared the president of \"collusion\" and deferred on obstruction of justice. \"It lifts a cloud that was over the White House for the entire time he was there,\" he said.\\n\\nBut if you accept that voters will evaluate Trump like an ordinary president, then the greatest threat to his political future was never just scandal and investigation. Instead, it was the vast gap between what he promised on the trail and what he has delivered in the White House. If Americans reject him in 2020, it will be in part because he has lost many of the people he said he would help.\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

He was 87.\\n\\nHis death was confirmed by Gary King, a longtime friend, who found Mr. Albertson\\'s body.\\n\\nIn 1959, Mr. Albertson took what became an inadvertent first step to resurrecting Smith\\'s recordings, made between 1923 and 1933: He invited John Hammond, the celebrated Columbia Records producer who had supervised her last sessions, to his apartment in Philadelphia.\\n\\nMr. Albertson, who was then a disc jockey at a jazz station, wanted Mr. Hammond to listen to two veteran jazz musicians, the guitarist Lonnie Johnson and the banjo player Elmer Snowden, in the hope that he would sign them.\\n\\nWhile no deal was made, Mr. Hammond and Mr. Albertson stayed in touch over the next decade and spoke often about Bessie Smith. Mr. Albertson eventually persuaded Mr. Hammond to reissue her recordings, a cache of musical history that includes acknowledged classics like \"Downhearted Blues\" and \"T\\'ain\\'t Nobody\\'s Bizness if I Do.\" Her accompanists included Louis Armstrong on cornet and Fletcher Henderson on piano.\\n\\nIn 1968, Mr. Hammond agreed to the project, naming Mr. Albertson its producer and Larry Hiller its engineer. In \"Bessie\" (1972), his biography, Mr. Albertson described the process of listening to all 159 of Smith\\'s recorded songs as \"a remarkable experience that only the raw power and emotion of an artist like Bessie Smith could keep from becoming mind-numbing.\"\\n\\nIn all, 10 LPs of her work were released, in five two-disc sets. The first, \"Bessie Smith: The World\\'s Greatest Blues Singer\" (1970), earned Mr. Albertson a Grammy Award for best liner notes. The other four were released gradually through 1972.\\n\\nReviewing the first four two-album sets in The New Yorker in 1971, Whitney Balliett called the results \"a wonder.\"\\n\\n\"Columbia, with Chris Albertson heading up the project, has done a herculean job on the Bessie Smith reissues,\" he wrote, noting that the strong sales for the first four sets had shown that \"what started out as sort of a foundation altruistic project, a musical-archaeological dig into the works of a blues singer who died 34 years ago, has become a thriving investment.\"\\n\\nMr. Albertson\\'s work on those reissues quickly led to a contract with the publishing house Stein & Day to write Bessie Smith\\'s biography.\\n\\nOne of his goals in writing \"Bessie\" was to debunk the many myths about her.\\n\\nThey included the long-held belief -- spread early on by Mr. Hammond -- that after the auto accident in 1937 in Mississippi that would prove fatal to Smith, a white hospital refused to treat her. Mr. Albertson reconstructed the accident, which took place on a dark road when Smith\\'s lover, Richard Morgan, driving a Packard, hit the rear end of a truck.\\n\\nThe impact of the crash forced Smith onto the road and nearly severed her right arm.\\n\\nDr. Hugh Smith, who was white, told Mr. Albertson in an interview for the book that he had been driving to a fishing trip and stopped to treat her, but that soon after, another car, with a white couple in it, plowed into his. Eventually, two ambulances arrived; one of them took Smith to a black hospital, where she died. No white hospital was involved.\\n\\nDr. Smith was at first reluctant to speak to Mr. Albertson, and referred him to some new Columbia LPs of her music, Mr. Albertson recalled in an interview with Terry Gross on the NPR program \"Fresh Air\" in 2003, when a revised and expanded version of \"Bessie\" was published. \"Read those liner notes and you\\'ll find the closest thing to the truth,\" Dr. Smith said.\\n\\nMr. Albertson responded, \"\"I wrote the liner notes.\" The doctor agreed to talk.\\n\\n\"Bessie\" was quickly acknowledged as the definitive Bessie Smith biography. Reviewing it in The Los Angeles Times, the jazz critic Leonard Feather called it \"the most devastating, provocative and enlightening work of its kind ever contributed to the annals of jazz literature.\"\\n\\nChristiern Gunnar Albertson was born on Oct. 18, 1931, in Reykjavik, Iceland. His father abandoned him and his mother, Yvonne, before his first birthday; she would marry three more times.\\n\\nHe was living in Copenhagen in 1947 when he first heard Bessie Smith on a tiny radio speaker. Impressed by the sincerity of her voice, he borrowed books on African-American music from the United States Information Service library.\\n\\nNotable Deaths 2019: Music\\n\\nA memorial to those who lost their lives in 2019\\n\\nThe discoveries transformed him, as they transformed other young Danes who dreamed of going to New Orleans to hear its blues and jazz musicians.\\n\\n\"We found magic in such names as Kid Ory, King Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey,\" he wrote on his blog, Stomp Off, in 2010.\\n\\nBy 1955 he had moved back to his homeland and was a disc jockey for Armed Forces Radio in Keflavik, Iceland. Two years later he immigrated to the United States, where he found radio work in Philadelphia.\\n\\nIn the 1960s he moved to New York, where, as a producer for Riverside Records, he recorded the final sessions of the blues singer Ida Cox and the pianist Meade Lux Lewis and supervised the label\\'s \"Living Legends\" album series, which featured artists like Alberta Hunter, Sweet Emma Barrett and Louis Cottrell Jr.\\n\\nHe returned to radio in 1964, spending about a year as station manager of WBAI, the iconoclastic listener-supported New York FM station.\\n\\nBy then he had begun writing liner notes for jazz albums, and a few years later he started his long associations as a critic for Stereo Review magazine. He also contributed to DownBeat and other publications.\\n\\nInformation on Mr. Albertson\\'s survivors was not immediately available.\\n\\nIn \"Bessie,\" Mr. Albertson wrote about Smith\\'s final Columbia session, in 1933, at which she recorded \"Do Your Duty\" and \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer).\"\\n\\n\"Following Bessie\\'s session, the studio closed for the weekend,\" he wrote. \"But when it opened again, Monday morning, a nervous 18-year-old Bessie Smith-inspired singer named Billie Holiday made her debut.

The Justice Department said Mr. Ludke was convicted last year of conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. Mr. Padilla-Conde will be sentenced this summer.\\n\\n\"Padilla-Conde swore allegiance to an extremely violent terrorist organization and then traveled across the country in an attempt to join it,\" Mr. Krueger said in a second statement. \"This case underscores that homegrown violent extremism remains a very real threat.\"\\n\\nMs. Dais and Mr. Padilla-Conde each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, the Justice Department said.

He had been in \"purgatory\" since losing his immigration status after a criminal conviction because diplomatic tension with Cuba made him difficult to deport, Mr. Powell said.\\n\\n\"He did not intend to go to the Middle East,\" he said. \"My client was trying to get to Mexico to start over because he had no legal status here.\"\\n\\nSeamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said Ms. Dais\\'s case was the more significant of the two announced on Monday. He described Mr. Padilla-Conde\\'s case as run-of-the-mill.\\n\\nHe said Ms. Dais had been \"kind of a key voice online\" whose activities highlighted the importance of the Islamic State\\'s female supporters, especially those from the United States.\\n\\n\"American women supporters in general, but her in particular, tend to be the glue that hold different online spaces together,\" he said. Ms. Dais played an important role online because \"she wasn\\'t just a connector, she was providing some level of skill to individuals who otherwise wouldn\\'t have it,\" he said.\\n\\nProsecutors said she used Facebook accounts stolen from unwitting users for her ISIS activities because she thought it would make it harder for law enforcement to track her.\\n\\nOnce she had control of an account, she replaced the original users\\' friends with ISIS contacts and changed the display name to some variant of her online alias, Hind Salah Eddin, prosecutors said.\\n\\nMs. Dais, who has seven children, also changed the profile pictures to a publicly available image of a little girl that was taken as part of a project on the Yazidi religious minority in Northern Iraq. The Yazidi were forced to flee their homes en masse after ISIS occupied their territory in 2014, abducting thousands of women and girls to be used as sex slaves for jihadist fighters.\\n\\nMs. Dais wanted other ISIS supporters to be able to hack Facebook accounts, too, so she made a video that taught them how to do it, prosecutors said. She then used social media to share the video.\\n\\nMs. Dais used the stolen accounts to post how-to videos that provided step-by-step instructions on how to build explosives, including how to build an explosive belt worn by suicide bombers, the Justice Department said in a statement.\\n\\nShe also used Facebook to share a recipe for ricin, a deadly poison made from castor beans.

That has anyone even vaguely interested in Bond speculating about who should replace him, and a number of people -- including a Bond producer -- have suggested the character should be played by an actor of color or a woman.\\n\\nOn Friday, the actor Ralph Fiennes, who plays M in the latest Bond films, waded into the discussion during an interview on the BBC show Newsnight, saying: \"I\\'d like to see a great black actor inhabit a Bond-like persona, but necessarily have it be in the same franchise. I think we remake the idea of a Bond as a woman, or as an actor of any ethnicity in another vehicle.\"\\n\\nThe comments drew an almost immediate reaction on Twitter, where the audience seemed split: some people applauded the statement, while others pointed out that, uh, Ralph, you took over the role of M from Dame Judi Dench -- a woman -- who was playing a role originally written for a man.\\n\\nFiennes wasn\\'t the first actor last week to comment on the topic. Eva Green, who played Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, was asked the same question during the premiere of Dumbo. \"I\\'m for women, but I really think James Bond should remain a man. It doesn\\'t make sense for him to be a woman,\" she said. \"Women can play different types of characters, be in action movies and be superheroes, but James Bond should always be a man and not be Jane Bond. There is history with the character that should continue. He should be played by a man.\"\\n\\nNo one outside Eon Productions, the company that makes Bond films, knows who will inhabit 007 after Craig. Oddsmakers in Great Britain have narrowed the field to six men, only one of whom, Idris Elba, is not white. Elba, who has signaled that he isn\\'t really interested in the role anyway, ignited this conversation when, in 2018, he posed this question during an interview with Variety: \"Are we interested in having a Bond character other than being a male? It could be a woman -- could be a black woman, could be a white woman. Do something different with it. Why not?\"\\n\\nFiennes and Eva Green both make good points: People love to complain about the reboot culture in Hollywood, so why not build a new super-spy franchise around a woman or person of color? But this ignores (at least) three much larger points.\\n\\nHollywood studios love reboots and existing franchises because they\\'re bankable -- the risk of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in Bond, or Star Wars, or Marvel anything is far less than pouring money into something entirely new. If you want to see a woman or a person of color lead a major franchise, the surest way is to give them something that already exists.\\n\\nNo one is suggesting the next World War II drama recasts Winston Churchill as a woman and FDR as a Hispanic man. But James Bond is not a real person. He jumped from Ian Fleming\\'s imagination onto the pages of a book, then onto the big screen. Yes, Fleming imagined him as a straight white man -- real people Fleming knew did inspire Bond -- but his books were written in the middle of the 20th century. Plus, the movies have evolved beyond the source material. And anyway, Shakespeare is constantly restaged with characters of different gender, race, and ethnicity -- it has helped keep those plays vibrant.\\n\\nJames Bond is clever, tough, intelligent, reckless, suave, stylish, and sexy. He\\'s a national hero, who saves the day every time. Now imagine what it would be like for a first-generation African immigrant in the U.K. to see himself in the form of 007. Imagine women watching helpless men abandon their allegiances to the forces of evil because they cannot resist a female Bond. Imagine how complicated the world would be for James Bond if he was a gay man but his job entailed sleeping with female foreign agents. Imagine if James Bond developed a chronic illness, nothing that would force him to quit his high-risk job but enough to make life more challenging. In fact, one of the men that oddsmakers like for the role, James Norton, has Type 1 diabetes. What if he brought that to the role? For the millions of children with Type 1 Diabetes, seeing Bond as a diabetic would give them a larger-than-life role model and eliminate any lingering stigma around the condition.\\n\\nThe most foundational part of James Bond -- beyond the character\\'s immutable traits -- is the fact that he\\'s British. And that means anyone who\\'s British should be able to play the role, whether it\\'s someone with royal blood or a second-generation citizen of the Crown. (In fact, two non-British men -- George Lazenby, who\\'s Australian, and Pierce Brosnan, who\\'s Irish -- have played the role.)\\n\\nIntroducing a new Bond who isn\\'t white, male, or straight would require some rethinking from the screenwriters. According to the books and movies, Bond was born in Scotland. He\\'s orphaned. His family has an estate. He becomes a Naval officer. This narrative could stay in tact, more or less, with some adjustments that could make the franchise more interesting.\\n\\nWithout changing the race and gender of Bond, the character has already evolved over the years. For instance, Bond was a chainsmoker in the \\'50s and \\'60s. Today Craig -- who does enjoy a smoke here and there -- seems more comfortable in the gym than the smoking section. Fleming\\'s Bond also served in World War II. Craig\\'s Bond is born in 1968, twenty-three years after the war ended.\\n\\nAll this is to say the Bond character is forever changing and, if it\\'s to continue for generations to come, must grow and adjust itself.\\n\\nUltimately, I\\'m not advocating for the Bond producers to absolutely hand over the role to someone other than a straight white man. I do think Elba saying, \"Bond, James Bond,\" in his raspy purr would melt audiences and open an exciting new chapter for 007. I also think Tom Hardy would bring a refreshingly gritty side to Bond (even grittier than Craig\\'s portrayal). Hell, I\\'m even confident Tom Hiddleston -- who was great in The Night Manager and is currently the odds-on favorite for the role -- would make a perfectly fine James Bond. But fans of the franchise must consider how truly profound it would be for underrepresented people to see themselves in one of the world\\'s most iconic characters.\\n\\nHe/she can still drink a vodka martini, shaken, not stirred.', 'source': {'uri': 'esquire.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Esquire'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/presenter-idris-elba-poses-in-the-winners-room-at-the-house-news-photo-529207302-1552934261.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.757xh;0,0.0964xh&resize=640:*', 'eventUri': 'eng-4675521', 'sentiment': 0.1686274509803922, 'wgt': 256}\n",

The boycott began in December, when Carlson said on his show that immigrants make America \"poorer and dirtier,\" and ramped up once again earlier this month after Media Matters resurfaced recordings of Carlson making perverse, misogynistic, and racist statements in old radio appearances.\\n\\nThe Hollywood Reporter reviewed the ads on Carlson\\'s show and found that he\\'s lost more than two dozen advertisers in recent months. Before Carlson\\'s December 13th immigration comments, commercials for Fox shows accounted for less than 4 percent of Carlson\\'s ad spots. But since Media Matters published its report on March 10th, Fox ads have comprised nearly 35 percent of Carlson\\'s total spots.\\n\\nIn his December remarks, Carlson accused the left of arguing that the US has a \"moral obligation to admit the world\\'s poor...even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.\" In the immediate aftermath, he lost advertisers like insurer Pacific Life, Land Rover, IHOP, Just For Men, Red Lobster, and Bowflex.\\n\\nIn the recordings compiled by Media Matters, Carlson defended instances of statutory rape, called women \"extremely primitive,\" and said that Iraqi people are \"semiliterate primitive monkeys.\" In the wake of this latest scandal, he lost ads from drugmaker AstraZeneca and bedding producer Sheex. Since the Media Matters report broke, Carlson\\'s only major advertisers have been Nutrisystem and Progressive insurance. These days, alongside the now-copious advertising for Fox\\'s other programs, Carlson\\'s show is reliant on lower rent \"As Seen on TV-style\" direct response companies like online reputation manager ReputationDefender, gutter protector Leaf Filter, and Fox stalwart My Pillow.\\n\\nMy Pillow, at least, probably won\\'t be going anywhere. The company\\'s owner, Michael Lindell, is a staunch Trump supporter who spoke about the Fox New boycotts during his recent address to CPAC. \"What they do is their deal,\" he said of Fox. \"My Pillow is another thing. I sell pillows.\"\\n\\nBut don\\'t get too excited -- this is unlikely to mean the end of Carlson on Fox. THR pointed out that the network earns far more of its profits from cable subscription fees than it does from its advertisers. And even while he struggles to maintain big-name supporters, Carlson has experienced a ratings bump in the aftermath of the Media Matters tapes.\\n\\nPerversely, his show may profit from the fact that his string of controversies are taking place within a network that\\'s been a mess for years. Sean Hannity and Carlson both benefitted from the departures their colleagues Bill O\\'Reilly and Megan Kelly, each assuming those former anchors\\' respective timeslots. And it\\'s not as if Carlson\\'s current big-name Fox competitors are behaving significantly better than he is; Laura Ingraham is the subject of her own boycott and Jeanine Pirro is reportedly sitting out a weeks-long suspension after making Islamophobic comments about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. So as long as the rest of the network remains an unadulterated dumpster fire, Carlson will likely be sitting pretty, even if his only advertisers are pillows and Fox & Friends.', 'source': {'uri': 'esquire.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Esquire'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'gabrielle_bruney@esquire.com', 'name': 'Gabrielle Bruney', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tucker-carlson-speaks-onstage-during-politicon-2018-at-los-news-photo-1052722724-1552309073.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0745xh&resize=640:*', 'eventUri': 'eng-4680515', 'sentiment': -0.4117647058823529, 'wgt': 247}\n",

This extraordinary, much lauded youth soccer coach has worked with hundreds of young people throughout the DC area, many of whom find in Coach Fofo a source of stability and strength in their otherwise chaotic and turbulent lives.\\n\\nCoach Fofo founded the Elite Soccer Youth Development Academy for students ranging in age from 5-19. It is more than just a soccer program. Under Coach Fofo\\'s leadership, Elite Soccer mentors young people and helps guide them through what they have to face both in school and in the streets after school. As a former member of Togo\\'s national soccer team, Coach Fofo has credibility with his young players. As someone who has worked in the Prince George\\'s County public school system for 15 years, he knows how to reach students and change their lives beyond the soccer field.\\n\\nBut after living in the United States for almost 20 years, he is now facing deportation back to his native Togo. He has been informed that he needs to go in and see ICE on April 29. Coach Fofo has a 15-year-old son who is an American citizen and a wife who was granted asylum after fleeing violence in Togo. He could be ripped from his family and community. As Nick Katz, Legal Manager at CASA, which is helping him fight any potential deportation said to The Nation:\\n\\nFofo has devoted the last two decades to uniting and empowering a diverse group of kids -- teaching them the core principles of community through soccer, and focusing particularly on supporting those from low-income backgrounds and those with special needs. Fofo\\'s deportation would be a devastating blow to his community, depriving generations of young people of a mentor and community pillar.\\n\\nIt says a great deal that the community is rallying to his side and using sports to do so. A soccer match to raise support for Coach Fofo is taking place Thursday evening. A quickly produced online petition called Keep Coach Fofo in our community has garnered - as of this writing - 800 signatures. Clergy and community members rallied outside ICE\\'s Baltimore office when Coach Fofo went in to present his paper work in March. Political leaders in Montgomery County, including County Executive Mark Elrich and the nine-member County council have all signed on to letters to federal immigration officials. The council wrote, \"If he is deported it would be a staggering blow to not only his family but hundreds of hard-working families whose lives he has impacted in both Montgomery and Prince George\\'s counties.\"\\n\\nIn addition, Coach Fofo fears that he could be targeted for violence when he returns to Togo for supporting organizations critical of the government. The political situation in Togo is currently very dangerous for dissenters. In late 2017, anti-government protests erupted in the tiny nation of eight million people. The response was a brutal crackdown condemned by international human rights organizations and governments. This is the maelstrom to which Coach Fofo would be forced to return.\\n\\nThe horrific situation that Coach Fofo finds himself in is a product of Trump\\'s draconian immigration policy, pushed forward by his white nationalist advisor Stephen Miller. As The Washington Post reported, his \"potential deportation appears in line with the immigration priorities set over the last 26 months by President Trump\\'s administration. Longtime undocumented immigrants who, under previous policy, were permitted to stay if they checked in and avoided criminal behavior, have increasingly been targeted for deportation.\"\\n\\nICE is not commenting on why it would be such an extreme priority for them to upturn the lives of Coach Fofo and his family, put his life at risk, and strand hundreds of kids who depend upon him for mentorship in the sports world and beyond.\\n\\nThis entire case is a travesty. As one parent said to me, \"Coach Fofo is part of the fabric of our community. ICE seems to exist to tear at that fabric and tear our community apart.

Please do the same.

The f is fricative and percussive, much like DiFranco\\'s habit of thwacking the side of her acoustic guitar as she plays it. Then comes the vowel sound, which has a gentle lilt that mirrors the way DiFranco sings: in dulcet tones that sometimes give way to a guttural growl.\\n\\nWe\\'re sitting at a corner table in the Standard Hotel on Cooper Square. Geographically, we\\'re not far from where DiFranco, who is now 48, lived in the East Village for much of her late teens and early 20s, but spiritually the posh, Parisian-inspired café is basically as far away as you can get from her scene in the 1990s -- the decade when she was a vital component of the alternative feminist rock wave. In the summer of 1989, when DiFranco first moved to the city, she called herself an \"anti-capitalist punk\" and paid her rent by washing dishes in a sweaty Brooklyn kitchen and modeling nude for a figure-drawing class uptown. As she writes in her new memoir, No Walls and the Recurring Dream, \"The City seemed to be in the hands of immigrants and artists, punks and queers, and I felt drawn to it like iron to the center of the earth.\"\\n\\nDiFranco is in town both to promote the memoir and to see the Broadway premiere of Hadestown, a show written by the 38-year-old singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell, whom DiFranco mentored early on. In 2006, Mitchell created a theatrical production based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice called Hadestown. In 2010, DiFranco helped Mitchell develop the show\\'s songs into a concept folk album originally released on DiFranco\\'s label, Righteous Babe Records. She and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver both sang on the album, which eventually grew into a full-blown theatrical spectacle that has just been nominated for 14 Tony Awards. On the record, DiFranco sang the part of Persephone, the world-weary goddess of fertility married to Hades (the current Persephone, Amber Gray, is in the current crop of Tony nominations for the role). DiFranco is overjoyed to see the project make it to the Broadway stage. But she just didn\\'t realize there would be a whole red-carpet situation. \"Now I\\'m in a panic because I fucking ... I didn\\'t pack,\" she says. \"I\\'m going to be underdressed. I was going to do black jeans and a T-shirt.\"\\n\\nI told her that it would be very on-brand for her to stick to the original plan. Very lo-fi. She sighed. \"I hate dressing up. I do. But I\\'m thinking, This is the Broadway premiere of a show you helped get up off the ground. If you can\\'t dress up for this, Ani, then when can you? I mean, I wore a wife-beater to get married. So that\\'s where I\\'m at.\" (In the end, DiFranco walked the carpet wearing a white tuxedo jacket with tails, a squat brown bowler hat, and a red rose stuck into her lapel.)\\n\\nDiFranco came out of the era of Riot Grrrl, Hole, the Lilith Fair -- when being a queer, feminist folk star didn\\'t seem like such a dubious distinction. But she never fit neatly into any of those microscenes. She called her songs folk music, but they were often more spiritually akin to Bikini Kill than Indigo Girls (even if she was friends with the latter). She was the less glossy Alanis Morissette, a less yodel-happy Jewel (in a 1998 open letter to Ms. magazine, DiFranco referred to her poppier contemporaries collectively as \"Joan Jewelanis Morrisette\"). Her style -- confessional, syncopated lyrics, often tinged with insouciance and rage -- paved the way for intimate, diaristic weird-girl rock. She sang about abortion, rape, poverty, sexual violence, menstruation, killing insects with her bare hands until they \"left a puddle of pus on my wall.\" You can still hear her influence in contemporary indie rock, from Tune-Yards to Lana Del Rey to St. Vincent to FKA Twigs. And yet DiFranco and her music always seemed disconnected from the machinery of the music industry. She never signed to a major label, instead starting Righteous Babe at 20 years old, so, as she explains in her book, she would never have to take corporate money to make her music. She stuck to her independent guns long after no one gave a shit anymore about selling out, and she was sexually fluid before that was commonplace.\\n\\nDiFranco\\'s memoir is a deeply retrospective work, not only grappling with her own history but with the decade in which she was most famous, and it comes at a time when public discourse seems particularly eager to revisit the Clinton years. One of DiFranco\\'s 20 studio albums is called Revelling/Reckoning, which seems like an apt description of the way we think about the \\'90s: reveling in the prelapsarian era just before the internet took over our consciousness, when people still had to get off their couches in order to communicate and most interpersonal exchanges were ephemeral and therefore less subject to the fear of digital backlash. But we are also reckoning with that time -- the way the media mistreated women back then (see: Lorena Bobbitt, Monica Lewinsky, Tonya Harding, Anita Hill), and the way the era\\'s feminism was full of its own prejudices and blind spots.\\n\\nDiFranco had a front-row seat to those contradictions. There is a purity in the grittiness of her path -- for the first years of her career, she made a living by taking buses all over the eastern seaboard to play coffee houses and college dorm rooms -- but some of her stories and songs can feel so \\'90s, stuck in an era when rebellion was defined by liberally using the word cunt. She is a foremother, to be sure. But, as she herself acknowledges, her feminist awakening was situational. \"I think that all of us see the social movement we were part of as starting with us,\" she tells me. \"That\\'s the human experience, the world begins and ends with me. So I told the story of the feminist revolution which started in 1989, in New York, with me -- that\\'s one more very subjective take on the way of things.\"\\n\\nAfter a while, we leave the Standard for a memory tour of the East Village, heading toward her old stomping grounds of Alphabet City, which she jokingly refers to as her \"landscape of misdeeds.\"As DiFranco walks down Seventh Street, past manicured brownstones that were dilapidated when she lived in the neighborhood, she tells me that writing her memoir made her confront just how much of her New York life was one of constant danger. One of her first jobs was working the 3 a.m. shift at the UPS factory on the West Side Highway, and she would walk by herself, at 19, in the alleys near Port Authority in the middle of the night. Her stomach was so tight after rushing past dark recesses that she often lost her breath.\\n\\n\"One of the things I noticed when I had sort of written the damn book and it was in front of me was how much of it was about survival and safety,\" she says as we turn onto Avenue A. I mention a passage where she meets a strange man on the street in her early 20s and agrees to move into a spare room in his apartment just because the space is big enough for her to practice her music in. She later discovered that the man was sleeping in her bed while she was away on tour. \"I will never let my daughter read my book,\" she jokes. \"I just was sure of my own invincibility, which I think is an ingredient in youth, you know? ... I was already angry, and I was insistent that I was going to walk wherever the hell I wanted to walk, whatever the hell time I wanted to walk there. It took a lot of risk taking just to be free and a lot of gauging the odds.\"\\n\\nDiFranco\\'s desire to take risks, despite the odds, gained her a lot of fans, the kind who would order her early tapes from feminist catalogues like Goldenrod and Ladyslipper when she had no official distribution channels. She was constantly touring, eventually moving up from coffeehouses in college towns to venues like the Beacon Theatre in New York and the Newport Folk Festival. She performed on Late Night With Conan O\\'Brien more than once.\\n\\nIn her early years, much of DiFranco\\'s material grew out of her experience as a bisexual woman -- she still uses the term dyke to describe her younger self, and did more than once during our interview -- and many of her fans were queer women who were thrilled to find a singer speaking so plainly about her sexual experiences. They often looked to her for political guidance, which sometimes led to friction. Her \"mother mentors,\" as she puts it, were the women of the Second Wave, so insistent on breaking down the male-female binary that they did not always engage in fluid thinking about women\\'s liberation. Even if she embraced their spirit (and they hers), she wasn\\'t always comfortable with their rigidity. She played the long-running Michigan Womyn\\'s Music Festival, the women-only camping folk festival that inspired the Idyllwild Wimmin\\'s Music Festival episode on Transparent. But she only played it once, because, as she writes in her memoir, she felt its environment was far too inflexible. She arrived at the festival with a friend, who was asked to remove her band T-shirt because it had a picture of men on the front. The festival was DiFranco\\'s ideal fanbase -- if she was embraced fully by one group in the \\'90s, it was the sort of women who danced naked in the woods -- but she never felt fully a part of the groups that claimed her. (The festival ended in 2015 largely owing to criticism for its trans-exclusionary environment.) \"Everywhere we went,\" DiFranco writes, \"some woman seemed to be dedicating herself to protecting some other theoretical woman who might be triggered or feel tacitly oppressed by some tiny detail of the known universe ... the quest to make everyone seem happy all the time seemed to have led to a world of micromanagement.\"\\n\\nWhen she married her first husband, a male sound engineer named Andrew Gilchrist (whom she always called Goat, she writes, because \"to me he looked more like a goat than a person named Andrew\"), in 1998, some fans felt betrayed. \"I read somewhere that I\\'m trying to challenge my dyke following by sleeping with a man,\" DiFranco told The Advocate in 1997. \"God, I would never go to such extremes -- like there\\'s a straight girl from hell lurking within me.\" She\\'s still haunted by the messages from gay women who said they felt hurt and abandoned. \"There had really been no more backlash against my marriage than there had been to every other thing I\\'d ever done but, after a certain number of repetitions I doubted even the weight of my own experience,\" she writes in her memoir. \"All the cards and gifts and sweet messages of congratulations I\\'d received from listeners were eclipsed by the clamor of controversy.\" (She married for a second time, to the producer Mike Napolitano, in 2009, and now lives in New Orleans with him and their two kids.)\\n\\nEven her decision to start her own record label, Righteous Babe, to distribute her tapes so that she would never have to be beholden to \"the Man,\" stirred criticism, or at least caused misunderstandings. After a 1997 Ms. article praised DiFranco for making more per record than Hootie & the Blowfish, DiFranco wrote a blistering open letter to the magazine expressing her dismay that a feminist publication would focus on the financial aspects of her music and not the artistic qualities. She wanted to stand outside capitalism completely, not be praised for her ability to game the system. \"I mourn the commodification and homogenization of music by the music industry, and I fear the manufacture of consent by the corporately controlled media,\" she wrote. \"Last thing I want to do is feed the machine.\"\\n\\nAnd then came the plantation incident. In 2013, DiFranco planned a four-day artistic retreat at the Nottoway Plantation in Louisiana, a giant plot of land where, as a writer for Jezebel noted at the time, \"the horrors of slavery are totally sanitized and glossed over.\" After the event\\'s Facebook page was overrun by critics and a change.org petition to cancel the retreat earned 2,700 signatures, DiFranco canceled the retreat and issued a statement of apology. \"i did not imagine or understand that the setting of a plantation would trigger such collective outrage or result in so much high velocity bitterness,\" DiFranco wrote on her website. \"i imagined instead that the setting would become a participant in the event.\"\\n\\nDiFranco tells me that she found the entire retreat experience devastating. \"It put a level of fear into me that I had never felt. I could stand up to anybody, until it was my own tribe. I would not be taken down by anybody. But when it became my own tribe, I experienced a crisis ... I just think Goddess help all the young artists and writers who are trying to be intrepid and insist on being human and being able to make mistakes, because that\\'s part of evolution.\"\\n\\nDiFranco\\'s entire oeuvre is about being aggressively human -- what it feels like to take up space as a woman, the sheer fact of having a tactile, tangible body -- which is why she tells me that she shies away from social media now. She doesn\\'t have the stomach for it, and she wants to save her vulnerability for her songwriting and her live shows. \"I really feel like if I had grown up in the age of social media, that would have sincerely affected my journey,\" she says. \"I know that a lot of shit that I just decided to do, I decided to do in a moment because it existed in a moment. We were experiencing something together in a moment. If that moment was going to live forever online and be criticized by the whole world ... Would I have taken my shirt off? No. Would I have spoken so unfiltered? I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nNow if she wants to post to Instagram, she sends pictures to a friend, who posts for her. She never checks the comments. She also does not read articles about herself or album reviews. She doesn\\'t even listen to her own old records -- she tells me she only hears the mistakes she made. To mark the release of her memoir, she is putting out a best-of record called the No Walls Mixtape, and to create it, she had to go back and listen to some of her earliest recordings. All she could hear at first was the \"cheesy digital reverb\" available to her in 1990. But once she stripped the recordings down to just her singing, she learned to appreciate them. \"I was like, That sounds like a young person freeing their voice from their body,\" she says. \"I am glad that happened.\" I ask her how she feels, given her reluctance to listen to her past efforts, to be publishing a book that chronicles her most intimate thoughts and experiences. \"I guess lately I\\'ve been feeling acute dread,\" she says. \"This is a whole new level of oversharing for the oversharing queen. I just want it to be June. I just want to get to the other side.\"\\n\\nAnother thing that happened when Ani DiFranco said fuck in the café: Time and space sandwiched and I felt a pang somewhere deep beneath my breastbone. Suddenly I was 15 again. Listening to DiFranco\\'s music (at first on tapes, then on CDs) was my first real exposure to a woman cursing with conviction, with no filter between herself and her righteous indignation. DiFranco provided a welcoming, if not bombastic, gateway to feminism for the kind of girls who sang alone in their bedrooms and felt angry at the world but didn\\'t quite know why. The chorus of \"Untouchable Face,\" a song off her 1996 album Dilate that is one of her most streamed tracks on Spotify, [SG4] revolves around DiFranco cooing \"Fuck you\" in a measured, passive-aggressive singsong to an ex-lover who spurned her for someone new: \"Fuck you / and your untouchable face,\" she sings. \"Fuck you / for existing in the first place.\"\\n\\nThese lyrics are, looking back, almost cringeworthy -- flippant and impudent, like blowing a raspberry in public. And yet, when I first heard them, sometime during the summer between seventh and eighth grade, they imprinted themselves deep in my psyche as a kind of oracular truth. I sat in my room day after day, singing along with DiFranco\\'s enunciated rhymes, yelling to the void about untouchable faces when I had yet to touch anyone else\\'s face but my own.\\n\\nIn a 2015 post on the women\\'s site The Hairpin (RIP) called \"32 Feelings & Then Some: An Inquiry Into the Non-Legacy of Ani DiFranco,\" the writers Lola Pellegrino and Meredith Heil did a cheeky investigation into why DiFranco\\'s music does not seem to resonate with as many young people as it once did for the members of my microgeneration (young Gen-Xer/older millennials) who blasted \"Not a Pretty Girl\" in our cars. The authors came up with several hypotheses: The kids are all listening to Lana for their sad-girl feels (and now, perhaps, Billie Eilish), her earnest raging against capitalism may be less potent in the era of influencers and hypebeasts, or simply that the entire landscape of music has become more diverse, more queer, and more radical, and that as a woman with two children married to a man, she is no longer on the forefront of the fight.\\n\\nDiFranco, for her part, is content to be \"pushed into the gradual position of elder.\" The title of her memoir, No Walls and the Recurring Dream, is both reference to the open-plan house she grew up in, in Buffalo, New York, and a dream she keeps having in which she walks across the stage of an empty theater. \"The stillness is further charged by the wistfulness of my lonely exit,\" she writes of the dream. \"Such a time we had! Such an extravagance of love! Is this a dream? Or ... my deathbed?\"\\n\\nShe ends the book on this note, speaking as if she already feels the dream is evaporating. She tells me that her 12-year-old daughter has a more sophisticated understanding of gender than she ever had as a young person. \"She informs me that in the sixth grade it\\'s hip to be queer ... It\\'s another identity to try on. As it should be for young people. I mean see which hat fits me best, and what I feel most me in. What an amazing change.\" Then she adds: \"I hope this book feels antique.\"\\n\\nAs we swing back toward the hotel and walk past Odessa, the all-night greasy spoon where she tells me wrote one of her first songs, \"The Diner,\" she seems calm, turning her face into the sun. What she really learned, she says, while writing her book at her kitchen table during \"stolen mommy moments,\" was that even though she often posed as a tough girl, a tomboy with dirt stains on her knees and a switchblade up her sleeve, she was often not as strong on the inside as she fronted. \"I can be extremely manipulated and not in charge of shit in my actual life behind the scenes,\" she says. \"I mean I sort of have constructed this outward crusade of bravery and self-determination, but actually, it\\'s like ... whoa.\" She sees her story as a lesson in perseverance, in learning to stumble and get back up. \"Just follow your instincts,\" she says when I ask what she wants readers to take away from the book. \"Just don\\'t listen to the world of people naysaying what you think of as your path and what your perceptions are. And make your own mistakes. It\\'s okay.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'vulture.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Vulture'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'rachel_syme@vulture.com', 'name': 'Rachel Syme', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/05/03/03-ani-difranco.w1200.h630.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4773173', 'sentiment': 0.2313725490196079, 'wgt': 223}\n",

Five days later, they found 14 more tons in 474 bags in another container. The National Parks Board, Singapore Customs and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said in a statement Wednesday that the cargo was declared as cassia seeds. Both shipments were en route from Nigeria to Vietnam.\\n\\n\"The sheer size of these two latest seizures is unprecedented and will undoubtedly prove a major setback to the traffickers concerned,\" said Richard Thomas of monitoring network Traffic.\\n\\nHe warned that the seizures themselves won\\'t put the traffickers out of business. \"The quantities of pangolins involved point to sourcing, processing and distribution on an industrial scale,\" Thomas said.\\n\\nThe pangolin is said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world, and its scales are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine. The scales are made of keratin, the same material in human fingernails. Their meat is also considered a delicacy in China and other Asian countries.\\n\\nWildlife groups are concerned that the busts point to a jump in poaching of pangolins.\\n\\n\"The World Health Organization recently endorsed traditional medicine and the industry appears keen to grow this market, outside of China, Vietnam and beyond,\" said Neil D\\'Cruze, the global wildlife adviser at the World Animal Protection. \"This is an alarming move for some wildlife species such as pangolins, as it poses a real conservation and animal welfare threat.\"\\n\\nPangolins are an extremely lucrative catch, he said. In rural communities where they\\'re hunted, poachers can make up to the equivalent of a full year\\'s salary from catching just one pangolin. Feeding \"the insatiable demand\" are middlemen traffickers who also profit from the trade that\\'s reaching more remote communities to hunt the animal, he added.\\n\\nPaul Thomson, an official at the Pangolin Specialist Group, said it looks like the pangolin poaching has increased but figures were difficult to ascertain.\\n\\n\"The illegal trade in pangolin parts has been going on for decades. However, pangolins have typically been overlooked in terms of concerted conservation attention and action,\" Thomson told The Associated Press. \"This is changing thanks to growing awareness of pangolins. And this awareness has partly been driven by the high volumes of trafficking seen today.\"\\n\\nIn February, Malaysian officials seized 30 tons of pangolin and pangolin products. This included live and frozen pangolins and 795 pounds of their scales.\\n\\nEarlier that month, Hong Kong said it had seized ivory tusks and 8.3 tons of pangolin scales belonging to as many as 13,000 pangolins. The shipment, which originated in Nigeria, was bound for Vietnam.\\n\\nSingapore made two markedly smaller pangolin scale busts in 2015 and 2016 amounting to 970 pounds. Those found to have illegally imported, exported or re-exported wildlife, including their parts, face a maximum punishment of two years in prison and a fine of 500,000 Singapore dollars ($367,000).\\n\\n\"There has never been a more opportune moment for full and thorough international investigations and collaborations to take place to find out who has perpetrated these criminal acts and bring those behind them to face justice,\" Thomas said.', 'source': {'uri': 'nypost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'New York Post'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@nypost.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pang1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.03529411764705881, 'wgt': 216}\n",

The delays came after hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who manage the flow of commercial traffic were reassigned to help stem the flow of migrants seeking to enter the country.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Monday reallocated up to 750 officers, citing a \"growing security and humanitarian crisis at the border,\" and said that the reassignments might rise to more than 2,000 personnel, about one-eighth of the total on the Mexican frontier.\\n\\nDHS estimated that as many as 100,000 migrants sought to enter the U.S. at the border in March, levels not seen in over a decade.\\n\\n\"Security is more important to me than trade,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday.\\n\\nWhite House economic director Lawrence Kudlow said Wednesday the administration was discussing ways to keep freight lanes open if Mr. Trump decides to close the border. He didn\\'t elaborate.\\n\\nMarcelo Ebrard, Mexico\\'s foreign minister, said Tuesday that the reassignments had caused huge delays by removing agents who inspect cargo vehicles as they enter the U.S.\\n\\n\"If we don\\'t succeed in normalizing this very soon, it\\'s going to cost us economically, in both countries,\" Mr. Ebrard said.\\n\\nAn average of about $1 million in commercial goods and services flow across the U.S.-Mexico border every minute, according to Jon Barela, chief executive of the Borderplex Alliance, an advocacy group that represents businesses in and around El Paso, Texas, one of the busiest crossing points for goods.\\n\\nHe said delays, including the threat of a border shutdown, have caused tens of millions of dollar of losses, hitting the agricultural sector and the auto-manufacturing industry hardest. The North American auto sector is highly integrated, and relies on the constant flow of parts and components back and forth across the border.\\n\\n\"I\\'m getting calls from a number of businesspeople in the area and they\\'re concerned about orders on the back end of the manufacturing process. Their clients -- manufacturers and logistics companies -- are very concerned that orders will be curtailed or even stopped,\" Mr. Barela said. \"These two issues, commerce and migration, need to be separated. This won\\'t be the last migration crisis in this country.\"\\n\\nIn Ciudad Juárez, the Mexican city that sits just across the Rio Grande from El Paso, two-hour waits for cargo trucks have grown into five or six hour delays and 8-mile long queues, forcing truckers to make only one single round-trip journey per shift, down from two or three crossings per day under normal conditions.\\n\\nThis week, the delays spread to the Laredo crossing as well, according to Jorge Solis, director general of Xpress International, a logistics firm that manages about 400 trucks in northern Mexico. There are 40 trucks a day just of beer from a Heineken beer plant in Monterrey, Mr. Solis said. The delays have forced him to scramble to find available trucks to meet the demand.\\n\\n\"The trucks are waiting to cross the border, and at the same time the company is still pumping out beer in Monterrey that we need to pick up,\" Mr. Solis said. \"Everybody loses money, because they are not able to get their product on the shelf. Even if everything resolves tomorrow, we will still have several hundred trucks stranded in Mexico. This problem won\\'t go away for three weeks or so.\"\\n\\nThe United Fresh Produce Association, which represents the interests of hundreds of growers and fruit and vegetable processors in Washington, warned members of delays and partial closures in El Paso, Laredo, San Diego as well as Tucson and Nogales in Arizona. The slowdown would likely cause millions in economic losses and increase costs to consumers, the group said.\\n\\n\"Already, inspection delays are being felt from El Paso to San Diego costing farmers, truck drivers and companies of all sizes,\" the association said in a statement. \"The solution to our immigration problems is not closing the border or slowing commercial traffic, but for Congress and the Administration to work together on real immigration reform.\"\\n\\nWrite to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com', 'source': {'uri': 'wsj.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Wall Street Journal'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'robbie_whelan@wsj.com', 'name': 'Robbie Whelan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-64427/social', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': None, 'wgt': 211}\n",

Nina Roberts\\n\\nOn a busy corner in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Khalid Hamid and his wife Shelly Marshall can be found scooping ice cream for customers in their shop Island Pops. They specialize in frozen desserts, from ice pops to ice cream, which feature flavors from Trinidad, where they both grew up. Currently, their two most popular items are soursop ice cream, made from the creamy sweet fruit that grows in Trinidad and a pink sorbet made from sorrel flowers. The menu features other surprises including lemon nutmeg cookie and orange bitters ice creams, as well as lemon lime basil ice pops.\\n\\nUntil last summer, Hamid and Marshall made their frozen treats at a shared kitchen space and sold their colorful creations at parties and festivals. In July 2018, they transitioned to a brick and mortar shop on Nostrand Avenue, amid other West Indian businesses like Trinidadian bakeries pumping out sugary aromas and patty shops, as well as newer businesses that reflect the changing neighborhood, like a French Senegalese café, a tiki bar and coffee houses.\\n\\nSubscribe to Observer\\'s Business Newsletter\\n\\nOn a recent afternoon Hamid commandeered the shop singlehandedly, while Marshall stayed home to mind their two young children. A light breeze from one of spring\\'s first sunny and warm afternoons flowed through the corner shop\\'s large, wraparound windows.\\n\\nNeighborhood regulars and curious first time customers started to form a line out the door. Hamid, sometimes serving three customers at once, still made time to talk to kids, give ice cream samples, explain the flavors and greet friends warmly with occasional fist bumps. No one seemed to mind the wait.\\n\\nDuring a break from the afternoon rush, Hamid explained why he and Marshall, who he refers to as \"Wifey,\" first launched their business after he\\'d worked in the nonprofit sector, their West Indian flavors and transitioning to a brick and mortar shop.\\n\\nDid you always want to be an ice cream entrepreneur?\\n\\nNo, I came for school from Trinidad [and] Tobago in 2002 to study psychology. I ran vocational programs for mentally disabled individuals for about 15 years; there were about 70 individuals, 30 staff.\\n\\nAfter I got married, I thought, \"I\\'m working for nonprofit, I\\'m giving, helping everyone else. There\\'s not much left to give to the family and build something.\" That\\'s when I started to tinker with the idea of having a business of some sort.\\n\\nDid you randomly pick ice cream?\\n\\nWhat happened is that my wife had gotten really sick coming back from Trinidad; she had this ailment called chikungunya, from a mosquito bite. After a week of horrendous fever and body pains, she was craving soursop ice cream. I tried to make it, and it did not come out good.\\n\\nWe couldn\\'t find it anywhere at the standard that we are used to. No one was making high quality frozen desserts using West Indian flavors. We realized we have a niche here. So, Wifey did the famous ice cream course at Penn State University and taught me how to make it.\\n\\nHow did you get your first customers?\\n\\nWe have some friends who are party promoters. We made cocktail popsicles and handed them out at these parties. It was just promotional and an avenue for us to get our name into the West Indian community. Eventually, people started taking orders and it blossomed into a business.\\n\\nWhat gave us our first real boost was winning the PowerUP business plan writing competition at the Brooklyn Library in 2015. They guide a class through the steps of writing a business plan, and each business plan is entered into a competition at the end. We won $15,000, and that\\'s what we used to get licensing and basically our start.\\n\\nExplain some of your Trinidadian flavors.\\n\\nWe use a lot of soursop; it\\'s pure deliciousness! When you slice it open it looks like milk with seeds. In Trinidad, we use sorrel around Christmas time when the flowers start to bloom. We brew it as a tea, seasoned with cinnamon and cloves. We serve Guinness caramel ice cream; Guinness was brought by the English who were in Trinidad for a loooooong time. Guinness is one of our favorite pastimes [laughs].\\n\\nSoursop fruit is said to taste like a combination of pineapple and strawberry with a creamy texture, similar to a banana or coconut. Pixabay\\n\\nAfter working out of a shared kitchen space and selling desserts at festivals and parties, was it nerve-wracking to open a brick and mortar shop?\\n\\nWe were scared for a long time to have a brick and mortar. We were comfortable without one, you know, you can come and go as you please.\\n\\nBut we took two years to build a following, to get peoples\\' taste buds going and minds wondering when we\\'d finally have a shop -- people kept asking and asking. Then, we did it last year. It was a smooth transition. We made the right choice; we had a very warm reception in the community.\\n\\nI want to say finding this space was by chance, but it was more like a blessing. We were just walking along the street, wondering where would we put this shop. We happened to walk into the landlord, who is also Trinidadian, and he was gracious enough to give us the space for a wonderful price.\\n\\nDid you need financing?\\n\\nWe are bootstrappers! Until we had a brick and mortar, we had not taken out any loans or taken on any investors. We were just using our savings, the business was taking care of itself.\\n\\nThe Brooklyn Public Library has been awesome to us. Once we decided we wanted a brick and mortar, the library\\'s Small Business Services helped us find BCNA [the Business Center for New Americans], and they were wonderful enough to help with some financing. We also used a crowdfunding Kiva loan -- we had 30 days to raise the money; we did it in one day.\\n\\nBesides your unique flavors, is there anything else about being an immigrant from Trinidad that has impacted your business?\\n\\nWe are used to having very little and doing a lot with it. Stretching a dollar. Trying to use what I have and making it work is something I do everyday owning a business.\\n\\nThe islands also made who I am. I\\'m pretty relaxed and having a business with something going wrong every other day, you kind of need a relaxed attitude, it helps my temperament. Also, work ethic. In the Caribbean, we work very hard.\\n\\nHave you OD\\'ed on ice cream, do you still eat it?\\n\\nI\\'ve actually become lactose intolerant! [laughs] It happened within the last year, so I have the sorbets. Occasionally, I just say, \"Oh, the hell with it,\" and I mix the ice cream with the sorbet.\\n\\nDo you use any of your psychology training now?\\n\\nEveryday! [laughs] No one comes to an ice cream shop unhappy, but if they do, I try and let them leave happy. Sometimes I find myself sitting down and just listening to people. I look at myself providing a service, not just selling ice cream, more like wellness -- a full island experience.\\n\\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed for clarity.', 'source': {'uri': 'observer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Observer'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'nina_roberts@observer.com', 'name': 'Nina Roberts', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/dsc_5673.jpg?quality=80&crop=0px%2C281px%2C4496px%2C2248px&resize=876%2C438&strip', 'eventUri': 'eng-4740374', 'sentiment': 0.411764705882353, 'wgt': 206}\n",

Victor Mercado, a spokesman for the Sunnyside Independent School District, said the protest by about 120 students lasted for about four hours.\\n\\nThe district is predominantly made up of Hispanic students, he said. \"Issues of immigration are pretty sensitive,\" Mr. Mercado said. \"If they do not have a family member who is in that situation, they know of somebody somewhere whose documentation might have a different status.

He held a variety of positions at the border protection agency before becoming its deputy commissioner in 2014 under the Obama administration. He won the country\\'s highest civil service honor, the Presidential Rank Award, in 2015.\\n\\nMr. McAleenan became the acting commissioner of the agency in January 2017 and was formally sworn in as commissioner in March 2018. He focused on counterterrorism, border security and trade enforcement, oversaw about 60,000 employees and managed a budget of over $13 billion, according to the agency.\\n\\nAs the nation\\'s top border enforcement officer, Mr. McAleenan also helped implement the Trump administration\\'s \"zero tolerance\" policy to prosecute parents caught crossing the border illegally, which led to family separations. That policy was reversed, but the effects remain. In court documents filed on Friday, the government said it may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the border.\\n\\nIn an interview in August, Mr. McAleenan said that \"a better system would allow us to keep families together for the entirety of the immigration proceeding, which takes an average of 45 days.\"\\n\\nHe added that there should be a sanction for crossing the border illegally.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not a victimless crime,\" he said. \"Not only are the people at risk, so are our agents who need to apprehend or rescue them.

And in October, the foundation announced efforts to make its own operations more inclusive, with volunteer committees that better reflect the United States population, though it will most likely take some years for those changes to fully play out.\\n\\nThough there have been calls to strip Mr. Batali and other accused chefs of their medals, the foundation has not done so. For some, this calls into question the foundation\\'s new efforts, as well as the ability of any volunteer committee to assess a nominee\\'s moral values when the inequities of the restaurant business are so pervasive behind closed doors.\\n\\nThe foundation also honored food journalists and cookbook authors with awards on April 26 in New York City, where The Times was named Publication of the Year.

But a new chapter opened in October, when the markets dropped sharply, and Mr. Trump began making critical presidential decisions with an eye to pushing stock prices back up.\\n\\nAs soon as the markets turned downward, Mr. Trump softened his hard line on Chinese trade practices, trying to quiet market fears that his tariff threats against Beijing would start a global trade war. Then he started attacking the United States Federal Reserve, saying its interest rate policies were undermining stock prices, and followed with rants about firing the chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell.\\n\\nAnd last week, Axios quoted a source who had spoken to Mr. Trump as saying that the president had delayed his threat to close the Mexico border out of concern over how the markets would react.\\n\\nFor Mr. Trump to base serious decisions about trade, monetary policy and immigration on market mood swings ensures that the zany uncertainty of his tenure will continue to reach new heights.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s sudden moderation on China was particularly striking because, in an otherwise mercurial career, he had remained consistent on trade. Going back to the 1980s, Mr. Trump has been accusing Asian competitors in particular of using unfair trade deals to steal America\\'s lunch.\\n\\nMoreover, Mr. Trump has been drawing broad support for his hard line on trade with China, even among his critics in Congress and in Europe. Many of them agreed that China was using state power to dominate the global information technology industry, exclude American companies from its domestic market and steal intellectual property. They were openly rooting for Mr. Trump to win on this issue, and to cut a tough deal.\\n\\nYet when the markets fell on fear of a United States-China trade war, Mr. Trump began to retreat. After taking office, his tweets on China attacked it for militarism, currency manipulation and unfair trade practices right up until the markets dropped in October. Mr. Trump\\'s first conciliatory tweet came on Nov. 1, describing a pleasant chat about trade with President Xi Jinping, and he has been talking up their \"incredible relationship\" and progress in trade talks since.\\n\\nBy last month, amid reports that Trump advisers were calculating how big of a \"stock market pop\" they could expect from a trade deal, Washington insiders from both parties were worrying aloud that the president might accept any deal China would sign.\\n\\nMr. Trump, meanwhile, was executing a similar about-face on the Fed. As a candidate, he had attacked the central bank for keeping rates so low and inflating \"a big fat ugly bubble\" in the markets. Once he took office, Mr. Trump stopped tweeting attacks on the Fed, until November, when he began to blame the central bank for dampening market spirits with high interest rates. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has not only fulminated about replacing Mr. Powell, he has also started considering market-friendly loyalists for seats on the Fed board of governors.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s most recent market-driven U-turn appears to have come on immigration, another subject near and dear to him. So far, the stock markets have not reacted negatively to his aggressive efforts to secure funding for a border wall, including the government shutdown and the declaration of a national emergency. Nonetheless, when Mr. Trump backed off on his threat to close the southern border, the Axios source explained the president\\'s decision this way: \"It\\'s the markets. Closing the border, the markets would plummet.\"\\n\\nNo president has shown this kind of deference. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and both Bushes mentioned the stock markets rarely and cautiously. Bill Clinton counseled against responding to their gyrations. In early 2009, Barack Obama suggested it was a good time to buy battered American stocks and was proved right when the markets hit bottom a week later. But Mr. Obama was criticized for acting as \"stock picker in chief\" and did not talk about stock prices again as president.\\n\\nMr. Trump is not only reading the markets as a daily measure of his success, he is also shaping policy to keep prices high.

After Mr. Trump turned conciliatory on China, the Fed announced it was suspending further rate increases, and stocks began climbing back toward record highs.\\n\\nSo who\\'s in charge: Mr. Trump or the markets? One critical test is the United States-China trade talks, which are set to wrap up soon in a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi.

The prospect of once again fortifying it is seen by observers on all sides as a risk to the entire peace process.\\n\\nTo preserve the peace, EU negotiators initially proposed making Northern Ireland a special economic zone, which would remain inside Europe\\'s economic bloc with the rest of Ireland after Brexit. That proposal was popular with Northern Ireland\\'s business community -- and the majority of the region\\'s voters, who opposed Brexit in the 2016 referendum -- but was ultimately rejected by the British government.\\n\\nPrime Minister Theresa May, who depends on the support of a small party from Northern Ireland committed above all to maintaining the union with Great Britain, proposed instead that the whole of the U.K. would remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit if no other solution could be found to keeping the border open in Ireland. The catch, for those dreaming of a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S., is that countries that are in the European customs union are barred from striking their own independent trade deals with other nations.\\n\\nThat has led the most hardcore Brexit supporters in the British Parliament to propose simply leaving the EU without any special arrangement for Northern Ireland and taking U.S. President Donald Trump up on his offer of a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S.\\n\\nTrade deals, however, have to be approved by Congress, which has, for decades, been packed with influential Irish Americans of both parties. Among those traveling with Pelosi to London and Dublin this week is Rep. Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat who helped broker the Good Friday Agreement and is the current chair of the House Ways and Means committee, which oversees trade policy.\\n\\nNeal is also the co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland caucus with Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican. Another member of that caucus accompanying Pelosi, Rep. Brendan Boyle, told the Irish Times that the delegation had a heated exchange with members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, led by Conservative Member of Parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg, in London on Monday.\\n\\nBoyle, whose father was born in Ireland, said that the delegation attempted to provide \"a reality check\" to those in Rees-Mogg\\'s group who claimed \"that the border issue is \\'concocted\\'\" by a secret cabal of anti-Brexit politicians \"in London, Brussels, Dublin, and Washington, all in some sort of grand conspiracy to force them to do something that they don\\'t want to do.\"\\n\\n\"We very much attempted to disabuse them of that sort of conspiracy-type thinking,\" Boyle said.\\n\\nRees-Mogg\\'s group continues to insist that any border checks after Brexit could simply be handled by technology. The fact that no such technology appears to exist anywhere in the world has not deterred them.\\n\\nThe fanciful nature of that supposed solution was underlined on Tuesday by Karen Wheeler, the British customs agency\\'s senior official in charge of post-Brexit border planning. \"There is no technology solution which would mean that you could do customs controls and processes and not have a hard border,\" Wheeler told business leaders meeting on Tuesday night at a Belfast museum dedicated to the Titanic, which was built in the city. \"There is no magic solution that would make that go away. If there was, trust me, we would have found it.\"\\n\\nAs the Washington Post reported, Pelosi also confirmed that, during her delegation\\'s earlier stop in London, she delivered exactly the same message to both the British prime minister and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn. \"We made it clear to all that if there were any harm to Good Friday accords -- no treaty,\" Pelosi said. \"Don\\'t even think about that.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theintercept.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Intercept'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'robert_mackey@theintercept.com', 'name': 'Robert Mackey', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/04/041719_dublin-1555509595.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800', 'eventUri': 'eng-4729184', 'sentiment': 0.4431372549019608, 'wgt': 173}\n",

Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has avoided detailed policy proposals, saying he doesn\\'t want to \"drown people in minutiae\" at this point in the campaign.\\n\\nHere\\'s a quick guide to some of the biggest proposals so far.\\n\\nWho proposed it? Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont\\n\\nWhat is the issue? Some 27 million Americans were uninsured in 2017. The major reasons are that the costs of private insurance are too high, people aren\\'t covered through their jobs and/or they are ineligible for government assistance.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Sanders\\' plan? He has proposed a single-payer health care system where a government-run plan provides insurance coverage to all Americans. Employers would be barred from offering private coverage, and recipients of Medicare and Medicaid would be transitioned onto the new plan. The plan would cover everything from maternity care to vision and dental benefits. There would be no co-pays.\\n\\nHow would he pay for it? He doesn\\'t say exactly. The plan includes a list of options such as payroll taxes, expanding the estate tax, increasing taxes on capital gains and dividends, taxing big banks and repealing deductions that benefit the wealthy.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Trump\\'s position? Trump has long called for repealing the Affordable Care Act and his Administration has sought to undermine it in court. But efforts to replace it with Republican alternatives failed in Congress. He has pledged to offer a \"truly great HealthCare\" bill after the 2020 elections but not given specifics.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the issue? The number of students taking out college loans has dramatically increased in recent years, leaving about four-in-10 adults under the age of 30 with debt. The median outstanding student loan was $17,000 in 2016, and all Americans combined now owe more than $1.5 trillion in student loans.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Warren\\'s plan? Warren would allow people making less than $100,000 a year to get $50,000 in student debt forgiven, with a sliding scale for those making up to $250,000. She would also eliminate tuition and fees at every public two- and four-year college in partnership with states; and give historically black colleges $50 billion in aid. Her plan would cost $1.25 trillion over 10 years.\\n\\nHow would she pay for it? By levying what she calls the \"ultra-millionaire tax,\" which would affect only the richest 0.1% of Americans. Households with more than $50 million in wealth would pay a 2% tax on every dollar they own above $50 million, and a 3% tax on every dollar above $1 billion. She also argues that erasing student loan debt would boost the economy, offsetting the total cost of her plan.\\n\\nWhat is Trump\\'s position? In a 2016 interview, a Trump campaign official said \"unequivocally no\" to debt-free college proposals. As president, Trump has proposed streamlining student loan repayment options, capping the amount of federally subsidized student loans that parents can borrow; ending student loan forgiveness for public service; and offering more grants for low-income students in career training programs.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the issue? Scientists say that the world\\'s countries have about a decade to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from things like coal power plants, gas-powered cars and agriculture in order to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change.\\n\\nWhat\\'s O\\'Rourke\\'s plan? He has proposed rejoining the Paris climate deal; ending oil and gas leases on federal lands; creating some kind of tax, cap or \"price signal to the market\" on carbon; spending $5 trillion on clean energy research and extreme weather preparations over 10 years; and directing federal agencies to buy materials made in more environmentally friendly ways.\\n\\nHow would he pay for it? By cutting tax breaks for oil companies and increasing taxes on corporations and the rich.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the issue? Although some employers provide it voluntarily, the U.S. is the only developed nation without a national paid maternity leave requirement. Studies show paid leave improves worker retention and lowers the number of new parents on public assistance.\\n\\nWhat is Gillibrand\\'s plan? Her FAMILY Act, modeled after programs in states like California and New Jersey, would guarantee new parents and caregivers of family members who are ill and people with serious illnesses up to 12 weeks of paid leave. Workers on qualifying leave would receive 66% of their salaries.\\n\\nHow would she pay for it? With a 0.2 percent payroll tax, split between workers and their employers. Gillibrand says that would amount to just under $4 a week for the average worker.\\n\\nWhat is Trump\\'s position? In his campaign and a State of the Union address, Trump called for paid parental leave. A Republican bill drafted in part with ideas from his daughter Ivanka would allow parents to borrow from their future Social Security benefits to pay for their own paid leave, but the bill has not yet moved forward in Congress.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the issue? The U.S. has the highest rate of incarceration per 100,000 people in the world, with 2.2 million people in prisons and jails, according to the Sentencing Project. This has largely been driven by tough-on-crime laws and policy changes over the last four decades.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Klobuchar\\'s plan? Klobuchar would streamline the process for federal inmates asking the president for a pardon or commutation, setting up a diverse, bipartisan advisory board to vet requests. The board would primarily review the cases of inmates serving long sentences for nonviolent drug crimes, especially those who have shown rehabilitation while in prison.\\n\\nHow would she pay for it? The plan\\'s costs are unclear, but there would likely be minimal administrative expenses.\\n\\nWhat is Trump\\'s position? As president, Trump signed a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that shortened sentences for some federal inmates and expanded job training and other programs aimed at reducing recidivism in federal prisons. He\\'s issued only a handful of commutations and pardons as president, mostly for high-profile people such as controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.\\n\\nWhat is the issue? Teachers earn 18.7% less than comparable college-educated professionals, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. (Including benefits, like time off, the so-called teacher wage gap is closer to 11%.)\\n\\nWhat\\'s Harris\\' plan? She proposes giving the average teacher a $13,500 raise, equivalent to a 23% boost in pay. The federal government would provide some money upfront, then match every $1 that states contribute with $3 in federal money. Teachers in high-need schools that disproportionately serve students of color would get more of a raise. Her campaign estimates the plan would cost $315 billion over 10 years.\\n\\nHow would she pay for it? By expanding the estate tax and ending certain tax advantages enjoyed by the wealthy.\\n\\nWhat is Trump\\'s position? As president, Trump has proposed cutting the Department of Education budget, including federal grants for teacher training, and shifting spending to more grants for charter schools.\\n\\nWhat is the issue? Experts say the U.S. has a growing racial wealth gap on everything from retirement savings to student loan debt. One study found the average white family has $919,000 in wealth, compared to $140,000 for black families and $192,000 for Hispanic families.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Booker\\'s plan? He proposes giving all newborns savings accounts seeded with $1,000. Each year, children up to age 18 in low-income households would receive up to $2,000. The money would be kept in a low-risk savings account managed by the Treasury Department with a roughly 3% annual rate of return. Children could only withdraw the money after turning 18 for things like going to college or buying a home.\\n\\nHow would he pay for it? By lowering the threshold for the estate tax and taxes on capital gains from inherited stocks and property.\\n\\nWhat is Trump\\'s position? Trump has argued that his economic policies have helped reduce the black unemployment rate. Fact checkers say his frequent claims that it\\'s the lowest in history are inaccurate, the rate was decreasing before he came into office and it remains higher than for other ethnic groups.\\n\\nRead More: \"An exclusive look at Cory Booker\\'s plan to fight wealth inequality: give poor kids money,\" Vox. \"Study: Cory Booker\\'s baby bonds nearly close the racial wealth gap for young adults,\" Vox. \"Cory Booker wants \\'baby bonds\\' for every newborn.

Former San Antonio mayor and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro\\n\\nWhat is the issue? There were 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2016. While overall apprehensions of border crossers have dropped, a record number of families, many fleeing violence and economic problems in Central America, are now seeking asylum.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Castro\\'s plan? He would reverse Trump\\'s travel ban, provide a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally, and make illegal border crossings civil, rather than criminal, offenses. He would also end agreements that allow local police to perform immigration duties, overhaul Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and create a \"Marshall Plan\" to aid Central American countries, among other things.\\n\\nHow would he pay for it? He does not address costs in the plan.\\n\\nWhat is Trump\\'s position? As president, Trump enacted a travel ban on eight countries, nearly all of which are majority Muslim; reduced refugee admissions; attempted to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children; and ended Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan, among other things.\\n\\nRead More: \"Putting people first,\" Castro campaign on Medium. \"Julian Castro unveils immigration plan that rolls back Trump, Bush-era laws,\" CNN. \"Castro unveils immigration platform, laying an early marker in the 2020 presidential contest,\" Texas Tribune. \"Julián Castro wants to radically restrict immigration enforcement,\" Vox. \"2020 Democratic candidate Julián Castro just released the most detailed immigration plan of any contender and it would reshape the US system,\" Business Insider. \"Democratic candidate Julián Castro rolls out first detailed 2020 immigration plank,\" NBC News.\\n\\nWho proposed it? Silicon Valley entrepreneur Andrew Yang\\n\\nWhat is the issue? Estimates vary wildly, but experts agree that automation will cost more Americans their jobs, with one-fourth of U.S. jobs already considered at high risk. Meanwhile, America\\'s safety net is divided among multiple federal agencies and state governments.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Yang\\'s plan? He proposes a \"Freedom Dividend\" that would allocate $1,000 a month to every American adult from ages 18 to 64, a form of universal basic income that has been floated periodically over the years by Americans such as Martin Luther King and Richard Nixon and has been tried in countries such as Finland. There would be no restrictions, conditions or work requirements.\\n\\nHow would he pay for it? With a value-added tax, a consumption tax levied on goods at each stage of their production and eventually passed onto the consumer.\\n\\nWhat is Trump\\'s position? Trump has said he will bring back American manufacturing jobs by cutting regulations, lowering taxes and levying tariffs on foreign-made goods. As president, he has proposed budgets that would cut safety net programs like housing assistance, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and giving states block grants instead of targeted entitlements.', 'source': {'uri': 'time.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TIME'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'ryan_teague_beckwith@time.com', 'name': 'Ryan Teague Beckwith', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-2020-presidential-campaign.jpg?quality=85', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 163}\n",

ANDREW CULLEN -- AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Pentagon may face long-term negative effects by defying Congress to fund construction for a wall along the Mexican border, but Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is going ahead with it anyway.\\n\\nThe Defense Department notified Congress its intention to transfer $1 billion in funding to go toward building 57 miles of fencing, roads and other measures on the southwestern border.\\n\\nIt\\'s an unprecedented tactic to notify Congress about moving the money around, rather than request the transfer. The decision will likely cost the Pentagon its ability to \"reprogram\" money in the years ahead, which will hamper its ability to react quickly to military needs.\\n\\n\"By unilaterally reprogramming, it was going to affect our ability long-term to be able to do discretionary reprogramming that we had traditionally done in coordination,\" Shanahan told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. \"We understand the significant downsides of losing what amounts to a privilege.\"\\n\\nHe added that the Pentagon was simply executing a \"legal order from the commander-in-chief\" President Donald Trump, who declared a national emergency at the border in February.\\n\\nOn Monday night, Shanahan authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to spend up to $1 billion in support of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs & Border Patrol to build 18-foot-high pedestrian fencing, roads construction and lighting installation within the Yuma, Ariz. and El Paso, Texas sectors of the border.\\n\\nThe Pentagon\\'s decision drew fire from Democrats and Republicans, alike, which see the move as a way for the Trump Administration to sidestep Congressional power of the purse. Earlier this year, Congress gave Trump funding to build just 55 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but Trump declared a national emergency -- a move that may allow him to access billions in federal funding without receiving Congressional approval. That decision was widely seen as a last-ditch \"nuclear option\" that will likely spark multiple legal challenges and fundamentally shake the balance of power in the federal government.\\n\\nRep. Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, issued a formal letter to the Defense Department on Tuesday that \"denies\" the Pentagon request to transfer funding. However, it was symbolic because no request was made. Instead, the Pentagon told Congress what it was doing. \"DoD is attempting to circumvent Congress and the American people\\'s opposition to using taxpayer money for the construction of an unnecessary wall, and the military is paying the cost,\" Smith wrote.\\n\\nTo obtain the border funding, Pentagon officials played what amounts to a bureaucratic shell game. It took leftover money that was allocated for military personnel and transferred it into counter-drug account, which gives the military authority to measures to support federal law enforcement efforts to stop drug trafficking.\\n\\n\"To look at the Pentagon as sort of a piggy bank/slush fund, where you can simply go in and grab money for something when you need it, really undermines the credibility of the entire\" defense budget,\" Smith told Shanahan.\\n\\nThe Pentagon intends to take another $3.6 billion in military construction funds that have not yet been allocated to a specific contract. The military generally uses that money to fund construction projects, including family housing, building maintenance and infrastructure repair, both at home and abroad.\\n\\nBoth parties have lambasted that plan out of fears that projects in their home states will be targeted. At Congress\\'s request, the Pentagon sent a list of more than 400 military construction projects with a total cost of about $13 billion. Shanahan has said no military housing, barracks, or dormitory projects will be impacted. \"We are solely looking at projects with award dates after September 30, 2019,\" he said, adding: \"Military construction on the border will not come at the expense of our people, our readiness, or our modernization.\"\\n\\nThe military has been deeply involved in implementing Trump\\'s immigration policy in the past year. Since last fall, American forces have strung coils of razor wire atop southern border fences and points of entry with Mexico. The Pentagon now has about 6,000 troops, including 2,100 members of the National Guard, deployed on the current mission along the southwest border. The Pentagon is also on the hook to help shelter up to 5,000 migrant children crossing the U.S. southern border without a parent. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the federal agency responsible for migrant children until they can be given to an adult relative, currently holds about 11,500 migrant toddlers, children and teens at U.S. government detention and processing centers across the country.', 'source': {'uri': 'time.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TIME'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'w_j_hennigan@time.com', 'name': 'W.J.

The recording was made with that intention -- to spread. This, Facebook said, was among the reasons the company couldn\\'t quickly eliminate the footage from its platform, which the killer chose as his medium for his broadcast.\\n\\n\"In the first 24 hours we removed 1.5 million videos of the attack globally, of which over 1.2 million were blocked at upload,\" Facebook said publicly on March 16. On March 20, the company elaborated on its efforts, explaining that existing \"content matching\" systems and artificial intelligence hadn\\'t been able to stop the video\\'s spread because the content itself had morphed so many times. (The company also acknowledged criticism that it should have done a better job.)\\n\\nFacebook can explain why such a video isn\\'t welcome on its platform, and how they removed it. It can gesture blame, as it did, at \"coordination by bad actors\" who seek to re-share the video with as many people as possible. But its other explanations suggest the company was also thwarted by a much larger and less organized group: the Facebook users behind the rest of that 1.5 million -- the people who, as the company said, might have been \"filming the broadcasts on TV, capturing videos from websites, filming computer screens with their phones, or just re-sharing a clip they received.\"\\n\\nPeople wanted to see this. People wanted to share this.\\n\\nElsewhere online, other platforms were also scrambling. Reddit banned a community called WatchPeopleDie, which had been active for the last seven years and attracted more than 400 thousand subscribers, after some of its volunteer moderators, already under increased scrutiny, refused to take down copies of the Christchurch attack. Liveleak, a YouTube-style video site, compared the shooting video to the \"glossy promo videos for ISIS\" and said that it wouldn\\'t \"indulge\" the shooter by hosting his recording.\\n\\nLiveleak, however, was far more frank about its users\\' desires. \"We\\'ve received no small number of complaints regarding the fact we will not carry the video,\" the website said in a post. \"We fully understand some people will be very unhappy with this decision.\"\\n\\nLiveleak isn\\'t the sort of site where you just happen upon something horrific; horrific videos are what its users, dedicated or casual, come there to see. Since 2006, under the tagline \"Redefining the Media,\" the site has functioned as a smaller, grislier YouTube, with a stated emphasis on news-adjacent footage that depicts war, crime or terrorism. Now nearly 15 years old, it still gets between 16 and 20 million unique visitors a month, with surges accompanying a rare viral sensation (a video of a plane landing sideways in heavy wind) or, more often, a spasm of well-documented violence.\\n\\nIt positions itself as an unfiltered companion to the mainstream media, but Liveleak has its roots in the culture of \"shock\" or \"gore\" sites. Its launch corresponded with the shutdown of its predecessor, Ogrish, on Halloween of 2006, at site that had, along with sites like Rotten.com and Stile Project, openly reveled in the prurience of what it was sharing. Some shock sites presented photos and videos of death and violence in the manner of (and sometimes alongside) pornography. Rotten.com accompanied shocking imagery with morbid news, essays and a reference \"library\" of dark esoterica. In its early days, Ogrish hosted footage of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\\n\\nA \\'Desire\\' to Transmit Trauma\\n\\nWhat were viewers getting out of videos of death? Of murder and massacre? Of car crashes, medical mishaps and workplace accidents? In a 2008 study of the Ogrish forums, Sue Tait, a professor formerly at the University of Canterbury, in Christchurch, New Zealand, identified four different \"spectatorial positions\" for viewers. There were those for whom the suffering on display was a source of stimulation, for whom shock and horror amounted to a form of pleasure. There were viewers who expressed vulnerability, sadness or empathy. There were viewers who said they were watching to prepare themselves for something -- a deployment, a difficult job -- and thought they could usefully desensitize themselves. And finally, there were viewers who seemed to see what they were doing as necessary, as a courageous or somehow countercultural act -- against the media, against censorship -- or in the service of witnessing some sort of truth.\\n\\nIn an interview, Dr. Tait recalled how some users would judge videos in shallow aesthetic terms, and describe how they would get more of a \"rush\" from certain types of videos over others. \"We knew people could desensitize themselves over time,\" she said. \"But here we saw people doing that intentionally.\"\\n\\n\"Some people would talk about the way they enjoyed them, and how their enjoyment reduced over time,\" she said. \"But the things they were saying they enjoyed were symptoms of post-traumatic stress.\" They were describing anxiety. They were reexperiencing their time on the site, as one might after a trauma, but describing this with a sense of accomplishment. Further, Dr. Tait said, \"I noticed a desire to transmit that trauma to other people, so that you could have other people to talk about it with.\"\\n\\nThis called to mind recent conversations she\\'d had with fellow Christchurch residents, one of whom had told her in a brief encounter at the supermarket that he\\'d watched the shooter\\'s video twice. He spoke abstractly about how it hadn\\'t affected him as much as he had expected. \"It reminded me of people on Ogrish,\" Dr. Tait said. \"It felt to me that this guy who was watching it was a bit disappointed.\"\\n\\nExperts almost universally advise against casting the consumption of violent footage as a fringe phenomenon. Jennifer Malkowski, an assistant professor of film and media studies at Smith College, who uses they/them pronouns and is the author of \"Dying in Full Detail: Mortality and Digital Documentary,\" pointed out that Liveleak, which is just one of many sources for such footage, is ranked by the web tracking firm Alexa as the 695th biggest site in the world, right alongside The Onion, Jezebel, and Forever21. Mainstream internet platforms have thrown vast amounts of money and labor (much of it invisible) at removing nightmarish content, hiring thousands of content moderators to identify and remove often traumatic and illegal content. But \"they\\'re circulated by many many people,\" they said. \"I think when you see those numbers from Facebook, you\\'re confronted with that reality.\"\\n\\n\"You realize that these videos aren\\'t circulated by a few maladjusted individuals,\" they added.\\n\\n\"To be focusing on the tech platforms is kind of like an imported crisis,\" said Barbie Zelizer, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of \"About To Die: How News Images Move the Public.\" She said: \"You cant extricate one part of the media environment from the rest.\" Conversations and norms around representing death, violence and terrorism in media span generations and mediums. (She notes in her book that Google experienced an extended surge of search for footage of a 2004 beheading of an American in Iraq.) Norms about what should be shown on television and in newspapers -- which Dr. Zelizer says have become more conservative -- have given way to debates about tech platforms. \"There\\'s no question that images have impact,\" she said. \"But we don\\'t know what that impact is, not in a way that could propel some sort of reasoned set of responses.\"\\n\\nThe big tech platforms, in other words, are inheriting, with much else, a problem that was once understood as the media\\'s. But services like Facebook are far larger than any individual newspaper. Big social media platforms have inherited much of the rest of the web and it\\'s users -- including the ones who might have spent time on a site like Ogrish.\\n\\nViolence and More, Made for Sharing\\n\\nThere are still plenty of videos of viscerally awful things on Liveleak. There are also a lot of videos about immigration, about how the media is attacking Donald Trump, about \"political correctness\" and about Islam. It\\'s one of the few platforms that still hosts videos from Infowars, which was banned from YouTube and Facebook last year, although they do not appear garner many views.\\n\\nThe remaining founder, Hayden Hewitt, who made the decision not to host the Christchurch video, acknowledged that Liveleak\\'s audience leans right, and that a racist contingent has found a home on the site. \"Yes, people who want to see these things will be drawn to it,\" he said. \"It\\'s as plain as the nose on your face.\"\\n\\nHe described racism as \"the epitome of stupidity,\" but recited familiar complaints about the extremes of \"both sides.\" (\"If you criticize the Israeli government, some people will claim you\\'re anti-Semitic because of that. And if you criticize radical Islam, you\\'re often accused of being Islamophobic,\" he said.) He hosts an internet show called \"Trigger Warning,\" on which he laments the rise of political correctness. He told me he believes that conservative speech is being suppressed on larger internet platforms, and that as long as that\\'s true, its users will trend even further to the right.\\n\\nOn shock sites, extreme violence often pairs with extreme politics. Whether witnessing the worst breeds particular views or spaces catering to one taboo invite others is less obvious. But Dr. Tait remembers racism as central to the community on Ogrish, as well. \"One of the most popular threads was a thread about white supremacy,\" she remembered. \"It was a lengthy debate that was really trying to give a scientific basis for racism.\"\\n\\n\"A lot of people talked about the reason for watching beheading videos, for example, as really wanting to see what the enemy was capable of,\" she said. \"And it was very associated with the right, and with the hatred of Arabs.\"\\n\\nIn a 2017 article for Participations, a media studies journal, the writer Mike Alvarez wrote of BestGore, another large shock site: \"It is apparent from the data that BestGore users do not view all human lives as equal.\" Comments, often presented as jokes, \"betray a view of humanity in which the life of the \\'other\\' is deemed less valuable, if not valueless,\" he wrote. On many shock sites, videos portraying police interactions, including shootings that elsewhere have inspired activist movements and debates about racism in law enforcement, are viewed as a case of the victims getting what they deserve.\\n\\nAfter it was branded an alternative to mainstream news, Liveleak became popular with American soldiers deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, and accumulated a library of footage of violence unfolding in Middle East, often posted with minimal context. There is footage from drones; of the aftermath of firefights; of mangled bodies. There is a lot of footage of cartel violence, though, as common on such sites, attribution is sparse and often unreliable, and the dead are treated as interchangable sources of content. (The most popular post of all time on the site, according to Mr. Hewitt, was the cellphone video of the execution of Saddam Hussein.)\\n\\nIn 2008, when the anti-immigrant Dutch politician Geert Wilders wanted to distribute his short film, Fitna, which intercut gory footage of the aftermath of terrorist attacks with an anti-Islam polemic, he chose Liveleak. (\"I put my life in danger for a man I disagree with on every level,\" Mr. Hewitt said of his decision to host Mr. Wilders film.)\\n\\nBut if sites like Liveleak ever had a case to make for showing audiences what the rest of the media won\\'t, their argument has, in the last ten years, become more complicated. In 2019, videos of human suffering are recorded, like many videos, with a clear intention to share -- and with a specific plan to do so, outside of any sort of professional or shared ethical context. Shock imagery, and violent imagery, isn\\'t just sought out, it\\'s hurled at people as a tool of harassment or intimidation, in service of ideology or of misinformation. Today, Liveleak is less a wire service than a macabre aggregator. Rotten.com is offline, perhaps forever. On anonymous message boards such as 4chan -- or 8chan, where the Christchurch shooter shared his manifesto -- images of human death are deployed frequently, and easily, for shock value.\\n\\nAnd while millions of people still decide to go out of their ways to shock themselves, to \"bear witness\" or revel in the pain of others, it\\'s also true that recorded death and murder has new ways to find them. Contrary to suggestions that the Christchurch shooter enacted a sophisticated media plan based on some keen sense of how the internet works, what he really did was horribly much simpler: he opened the most popular app in the world, pressed a button and shared.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'john_herrman@nytimes.com', 'name': 'John Herrman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/23/style/23shocksites-1/23shocksites-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.3960784313725491, 'wgt': 151}\n",

The president vowed on Tuesday to make the GOP the \"party of health care\" and told Senate Republicans to lean into their own agenda on the issue as they head into next year\\'s election.\\n\\nThe moves could help Trump rally his conservative base as he celebrates Attorney General William Barr\\'s summary of special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s report that said there was no evidence that the president or his associates colluded with Russia in the 2016 campaign. But the push also poured political kerosene on an issue that many Democrats credit with powering their midterm election victories in November.\\n\\nTop Democrats, including presidential candidates, said health care is an issue that resonates with voters more than the Mueller investigation.\\n\\n\"This is something that Americans care deeply about,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a White House hopeful. \"I may not have been asked about the Mueller report at town hall meetings, but I was sure asked about health care.\"\\n\\nOther Democrats appeared to relish the chance to shift to health care. Asked if the Trump administration\\'s court filing allowed Democrats to turn the page on Mueller, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would have been talking about health care no matter what.\\n\\n\"We have been dealing with health care constantly,\" the California Democrat said. \"The public attention has been on the Mueller report, but we have been focused on health care.\"\\n\\nAnother 2020 contender, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, said if Trump \"wants to have a fight on health care, it\\'s a fight we\\'re willing to have. And it\\'s a fight he is going to lose.\"\\n\\nThat confidence is in part because health care was a big political winner for Democrats last year. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 115,000 midterm voters nationwide, nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care as the most important among a list of key issues including immigration, the economy and the environment. A Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday found 55 percent of Americans supporting the improvement and not the replacement of the nation\\'s health care system.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has twice upheld President Barack Obama\\'s health care law, known as \"Obamacare.\" Five justices -- a majority -- who upheld the law in 2012 are still on the bench.\\n\\nTrump\\'s effort to repeal Obamacare narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017. Nearly two years later, it\\'s unclear where the White House plans to focus its health care efforts. Trump\\'s most recent budget backs one piece of the legislation that stalled in the Senate.\\n\\nRepublicans gained Senate seats last fall, but there\\'s no indication that GOP senators want another fight over repealing Obamacare -- particularly not those up for re-election next year. The GOP also lost control of the House, which means any attempt to dismantle the law could not pass Congress.\\n\\nOne White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity to address still-early talks, said discussions are ongoing with Pelosi\\'s office on legislation to lower prescription drug prices, but no substantive path forward for a broader health care bill has emerged.\\n\\nAs the debate plays out on Capitol Hill, the White House made a surprising legal argument for eliminating the health care bill. In a Monday court filing, the administration said the entire health care law should be struck down as unconstitutional after Congress repealed fines on people who remain uninsured.\\n\\nThat\\'s at odds with previous statements by leading congressional Republicans who said they didn\\'t intend to repeal other parts of the law when they cut out its fines, effective this year. It\\'s also a departure from the administration\\'s earlier stance in a lower court, where it had argued that only federal safeguards for people with pre-existing medical conditions and limits on premiums charged to older, sicker people should be struck down.\\n\\nRepeal of Obamacare in its entirety would risk making more than 20 million people uninsured. That includes some 12 million low-income people covered through its Medicaid expansion and some 11 million purchasing subsidized private health insurance through HealthCare.gov and state-run insurance markets.\\n\\nSome Republicans say that wouldn\\'t happen because the Trump administration\\'s \"repeal and replace\" plan would send grants to states for them to run their own health insurance programs. However, during the 2017 congressional debate over repealing the health law, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the GOP replacement plans would result in steep coverage losses.\\n\\nSeveral GOP senators said Tuesday that Trump told them to ensure those with pre-existing conditions stayed protected as they work on an Obamacare replacement. Republicans appeared ready to back up the president on health care for now.\\n\\nTrump is \"thinking that\\'s the issue that defines us as conservatives,\" Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters after the president addressed a closed-door meeting of GOP senators.\\n\\nRep. Steve Scalise, the House minority whip, said Democrats have \"misled\" voters about the benefits of Obamacare.\\n\\n\"They were misled about collusion with Russia,\" said Scalise, R-La. \"The same people that have been misleading on all those other issues want to try to mislead people on health care costs.\"\\n\\nThe sudden focus on the health care law comes as Democratic presidential candidates have embraced a move toward a single-payer health care system known as \"Medicare for All.\" The momentum for that effort could wane if congressional Democrats instead have to focus on defending Obamacare.\\n\\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday unveiled legislation to shore up the Affordable Care Act and expand enrollment to millions more people.\\n\\n\"For (Trump) to bring this back up is traumatic, and it shines a real light on what the contrast is going to be between him and whoever the Democratic nominee is,\" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Democratic group American Bridge.

Big ones.\\n\\nBy Manny Fernandez in Los Indios, Tex.\\n\\nThe border wall doesn\\'t get any shorter or stranger than this -- giant, pointy-topped steel pillars that would seem imposing, if only there were more of them.\\n\\nThis border fence has exactly 36 burgundy-colored beams. They stand alone on a grassy island in South Texas where two dirt roads intersect. It\\'s open on the left and open on the right. You can walk around the whole thing at a fast clip in 17.36 seconds, a quick lap around a pocket-sized piece of America\\'s border security.\\n\\nThe line that is the border wall here is dotted. It zigs. It zags. It stops. It starts. It stops again. It has corners where it mimics the twists and turns of the Rio Grande. And it has doors. Sometimes, these doors are gates that open when a code is entered on a keypad. Sometimes, these doors are full-fledged openings -- a road cuts into the fence, leaving a gap that essentially gives the Border Patrol one more thing to worry about.\\n\\nThe mini-wall is the unusual product of two such openings. The fence line in the Texas border town of Los Indios spreads out north of the Los Indios International Bridge, about 20 miles northwest of Brownsville. The steel-slat wall traces a path parallel to Robertson Street, in a flat rural landscape of corn and grain sorghum fields. But at the point where Robertson Street intersects with Rio Grande Avenue, the border wall takes a hard left and flows to the west along Rio Grande Avenue.\\n\\nThe fence designers created an opening on Robertson but also put another one at Rio Grande. So as the fence turns at this intersection, the two openings create a leftover morsel of wall in the middle: a lonely, taxpayer-funded gothic median.\\n\\nPresident Trump lamented the various doors in the border wall last week, during a border-security roundtable in Calexico, Calif. He talked about a stretch of fence along the Rio Grande that had been erected under previous administrations, saying it was \"not a good-looking wall\" because it had \"36 doors that you can drive a truck through.\"\\n\\n\"So now we\\'re filling up those big, those big gaping wounds in this wall and it\\'s going to have a big effect,\" Mr. Trump said.\\n\\nBut it\\'s unclear if the president was aware of this Los Indios patch, which was built around 2009. Local and federal officials said the funding dried up to close the openings and install gates that would connect the grassy island with the rest of the fencing.\\n\\nRepresentative Filemon B. Vela Jr., a Democrat who represents Brownsville in Congress and whose district includes Los Indios, said the little piece of fence illustrated the pointlessness of a border wall, regardless of which administration built it.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve voted against every single piece of border wall funding that\\'s ever come up, and I\\'m going to continue to do so,\" Mr. Vela said. \"Decisions are being made in Washington in terms of where to put fencing that don\\'t make any sense.\"\\n\\nAs the president suggested, this strange little spot\\'s days appear to be numbered. A Border Patrol official who oversees the Los Indios area, Henry Leo, the patrol agent in charge of the agency\\'s station in Harlingen, Tex., said plans are in the works to finally install the necessary gates in the next one to three years.\\n\\n\"We did request additional fencing and gates in that area, so what you see right now is not the complete picture,\" Mr. Leo said. \"The plan is to connect to that piece of fencing and make it a continuous fence with gates.\"\\n\\nBoth Mr. Leo and the mayor of Los Indios, Rick Cavazos, defended the fence in the area, including the stand-alone section, saying that overall the fencing had helped decrease illegal crossings. \"I saw a dramatic decline in crossings and apprehensions as a result of the barrier,\" said Mr. Cavazos, who is a retired Border Patrol agent. \"In 2004, 2005, 2006, this was a high crossing area. People would come up from the river. The numbers went down.\"\\n\\nOn a hot April afternoon, it was all quiet at the fence island. The loudest sound was the soil: the dry brush, dirt and grass crunches underfoot. The pillars of the fence are as rough as sandpaper, and leave little red flakes on your fingertips that resemble chili powder.\\n\\nAdding to the head-scratching quality of this fence is its location.\\n\\nOn one side of the fence is America. But the other side is America, too. The fence runs inland, far from the river, the middle of which is the official boundary between Mexico and the United States. That means this 36-beam fence in one sense divides the country itself. In that sense, the openings in the fence are necessary: They allow property owners and ranchers to access their land that is north of the river but south of the fence, a region locals call a \"no man\\'s land.\"\\n\\nHere, as much as anywhere, the Border Patrol is watching. Walk around the spot, and it\\'s only a matter of minutes before two agents drive up in marked and unmarked vehicles.\\n\\nManny is one of a team of New York Times journalists reporting on the border.

Shear, Miriam Jordan and Manny Fernandez explores years of warnings that the U.S. immigration system is broken, or on the verge of breaking, and how it got there:\\n\\nIn recent days, officials have grasped for ever-more-dire ways to describe the situation: \"operational emergency\"; \"unsustainable\"; \"systemwide meltdown.\"\\n\\nOne top official said simply: \"The system is on fire.\"\\n\\nRead the full story here.\\n\\nAn intense week for border news\\n\\nBy Caitlin Dickerson, New York Times national immigration reporter\\n\\nFirst came the news that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had resigned, likely at the request of President Trump. Then, at least two other high ranking agency officials were pegged for dismissal -- all of it happening days after the president had pulled back on his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with Mr. Trump telling reporters that he had decided to go in a \"tougher direction.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s been a whirlwind week on the immigration front, with all signs suggesting that the president plans to triple down on his goal of securing the border. The unusually large number of heads rolling around Washington seemed to indicate that anyone with misgivings about the administration\\'s plans will be asked -- if not forced -- to leave.\\n\\nMr. Trump is operating under mounting pressure from unauthorized border crossings that are steadily increasing. And he\\'s contending with the painful reality that after 14 months of harsh policies designed to discourage immigration, he, the president who was elected on a promise to crack down on border crossings, has not made a meaningful dent in them.\\n\\nTo the contrary, whoever fills the now-open jobs in his administration will have to contend with record numbers of Central American families seeking asylum, all of whom are being processed through a decades-old system that is not equipped to handle them. And their efforts will be frustrated by the same set of laws and court settlements that have blocked many of the administration\\'s attempts thus far from going into effect.\\n\\nIt was those laws that led to the downfall of Ms. Nielsen, who lost her job because the president felt that she was not hawkish enough. Though she became known during her tenure as the public face of many of Mr. Trump\\'s most controversial immigration policies, including family separation, in private, the two had often clashed when she cautioned him about the legal and logistical constraints that rendered his policy ideas untenable.\\n\\nRead earlier installments of Crossing the Border here.

Maybe if he wasn\\'t so meticulously private and the band released albums more frequently than once every half-decade, their size and scope wouldn\\'t be so hard to pin down. What\\'s much less ambiguous is that Streetlight Mainfesto just plain matters.\\n\\nWithout a studio release since 2013\\'s The Hands That Thieve, the brass-inflected seven-piece has been able to take its panoramic ska-punk on big theater tours and play to a couple thousand fans per night, while diehards pore over every bread crumb towards long-rumored new music. There\\'s good reason to: Hands is such a thunderous call-to-arms of an album, you could make a good case for it as Kalnoky\\'s most memorable since 1998\\'s Keasbey Nights, his first band Catch 22\\'s debut and a sealed-in-time classic within the genre. Even less ambiguous? Kalnoky will very soon be leading a band that\\'s literally very big.\\n\\nBandits Of the Acoustic Revolution, the enigmatic folk-punk collective he founded in 2001, will play New York\\'s Radio City Music Hall on Saturday (May 4), backed by a 45-piece orchestra. Bandits released only one recorded project -- 2001\\'s A Call To Arms EP -- then lied relatively dormant until last year, when they reconvened to play New York\\'s Beacon Theatre and Los Angeles\\' Orpheum Theatre. Keep in mind Streetlight hadn\\'t released anything since 2013, so while the diehards pined for a new album from Kalnoky\\'s much more famous band, the singer-guitarist hit them with an insurmountably ambitious live project from a group with only five recorded songs to its name.\\n\\nPromoters were understandably hesitant to take such an obscure project to such prestigious venues, but Streetlight\\'s touring credentials convinced them; selling out those dates got them coming back for more. This year\\'s Bandits docket (which also hits Chicago May 11 and L.A. May 18) figures to include orchestral renditions from the Bandits and Streetlight catalogs, ahead of another batch of recently-announced shows from the latter.\\n\\nAnd about new Streetlight Manifesto music -- Kalnoky isn\\'t giving any dates, but he insists it\\'s a very real thing that\\'s being worked on now. When it does arrive, it will be the first Streetlight music self-released through Kalnoky\\'s own imprint, Pentimento Music Company. Following The Hands That Thieve, the band was released from a long, unhappy relationship with Victory Records, Kalnoky\\'s label since Keaseby Nights. \"I can\\'t wait to actually have something to put out,\" Kalnoky says. \"This is gonna be the first time we get to put something out on our own terms, on our own label, with no one else being involved.\"\\n\\nKalnoky has been chasing true independence for much of his life. Now that he can finally taste it, what\\'s he going to do with it? Billboard recently chatted with him about exactly that.\\n\\nSo how did you guys wind up playing Radio City Music Hall?\\n\\nLast year was the first year we did the orchestral thing, with the Bandits Of the Acoustic Revolution, and it was actually difficult to find a venue at all. Bandits Of the Acoustic Revolution is not really a band; it was more of a side recording project I put together 15 or 16 years -- shit, almost 20 years ago -- in my basement. So there was no history of the band.\\n\\nStreetlight obviously had a history of 15 years of touring, playing larger and larger places. None of the promoters wanted to take on this weirdly-named project with a full orchestra, so we had to put the Streetlight name behind it [along with] the clout of a booking agent to get us a venue that could even physically fit what we wanted to do on the stage and still have a seated area for the crowd, as opposed to general admission. None of the places we normally play could host an orchestra.\\n\\nLast year we got the Beacon Theater and that sold out so fast, which gave us some currency with promoters. We were not expecting Radio City, but we got to choose from three venues and as soon as we saw Radio City on the list, we were like, hell yeah, we gotta do that. IF for no other reason than New Jersey and Tri-State area bragging rights.\\n\\nWhat\\'s it like organizing and arranging an orchestral show around these songs?\\n\\nWe\\'ve been playing for a million years with seven instruments -- electric instruments, amps, drums, and whatnot. And now we have essentially about 60 wooden instruments onstage with a microphone for each one... I think it\\'s just as daunting, humbling, exhausting, excruciating, and painful as you would imagine. I haven\\'t slept properly in probably the last month or so.\\n\\nI\\'m interested where the drive for a project this ambitious comes from. You mentioned these orchestral versions have been in your head for years -- how do you think they get there?\\n\\nI think for everyone, every musician, there\\'s music that\\'s always playing in the background when they\\'re growing up. For me in my house it was classical music -- a lot of Eastern European folk music -- but primarily there was always a radio station or CD player playing classical music. My brother [Achilles Kalnoky] is a violinist, and he\\'s also in the Acoustic Bandits orchestra for these shows.\\n\\nWas your family\\'s interest in classical music linked to growing up in Czechoslovakia?\\n\\nNo. Well... Maybe there is a little more emphasis on classical music in Europe, not particularly Eastern Europe.\\n\\nIt was a typical immigrant story, where I was supposed to play piano and be an engineer, and my brother was supposed to be the doctor and play violin. When you\\'re small and malleable your parents can get you started on these paths, but once puberty kicks in, you rebel. So I rebelled and quit piano and decided I didn\\'t want to be an engineer -- but my brother stuck with it. They would drag me to his classical concerts and I would hang out in the parking lot, a lot of times skateboarding.\\n\\nYour family came to the United States when you were five, right? What made your folks want to come over?\\n\\nThe general awfulness of communism... My parents decided, more for the kids, that they were gonna get out and head to America. So they put a very complicated escape plan into motion, which I won\\'t get into the details of now. They managed to escape with their kids to America to get a better life for everyone. I went ahead and played music instead of staying in school. [Laughs.]\\n\\nI grew up going to the Stone Pony [in Asbury Park, NJ], cutting my teeth in the punk rock scene... I started college at Rutgers [in New Brunswick, NJ]. My first band Catch 22 was the Rutgers years. I was actually studying engineering but I decided to leave and go to art school. I was 19 or 20 when I left for [Savannah College of Art and Design]... I\\'d just quit Catch 22, so I wanted to get away from everything. I didn\\'t go to any shows, just ignored it for a couple years. I spent six or seven years doing the whole college thing, just taking my time with it -- that\\'s where I got my degree in graphic design.\\n\\nStreetlight Manifesto was born then. I would finish classes on Friday afternoon and drive the 12 hours back up to New Jersey. I built a... you can\\'t even call it a recording studio. It was essentially a two-human-sized box. I had egg crates in there and whatnot in my parents\\' basement. I would invite buddies from the New Jersey punk rock scene in the Catch 22 years over to record stuff. That\\'s how the Bandits Of the Acoustic Revolution got its start. It was more of a recording project than a live band at the time.\\n\\nSo you were regularly driving back and forth from Georgia to New Jersey?!?\\n\\nYeah, driving for some reason has been almost a form of therapy for me. I can drive for a day straight. I\\'ve done a lot of cross-country driving in my life. I think my longest drive was 21 hours straight, with bathroom and gas station breaks, in a 20-foot U-Haul with all our gear in the back. It\\'s funny because we\\'ll play a show, wrap up, go out the back door, and usually our contingent of hardcore fans is there to say hello, get autographs or selfies. And then they watch me walk over to this massive truck, get in there by myself, and drive away. [Laughs.]\\n\\nI think Streetlight Manifesto is one of the biggest small bands, or one of the smallest big bands -- I\\'m not sure which one. People don\\'t realize how, to this day, we\\'re about as DIY as it gets. Just the fact i\\'m talking to you now... you\\'re the first interview I\\'ve done in over 10 years. We don\\'t necessarily partake in all the traditions of a band of this size. We never read the manual on how to do it, never followed other artists.\\n\\nI think that has contributed to the fact we\\'re still around while we\\'ve seen so many bands come and go. Bands that we\\'ve taken on the road, that have opened for us... a year later they\\'re massive and then two or three years later they\\'ve imploded or got into fights, bad management, this and that. It\\'s the charm of Streetlight but it\\'s also an unspoken secret as to why we\\'ve been around so long -- doing it ourselves and doing it our own way.\\n\\nYou recently announced some new Streetlight tour dates to come after the Bandits shows. What can fans expect?\\n\\nWe\\'re just coming off of two years of doing the [Everything Goes Numb 15-year] anniversary tours. We got to play a bunch of songs we normally don\\'t play and hadn\\'t played in years. This year is a nice catharsis where we get to relax and play exactly what we want to play. We\\'re also going to be adding a lot of songs we\\'ve never or rarely played before -- the band favorites, as opposed to fan favorites. We see requests for some of these songs too, but it\\'s not going to be the most obvious songs we\\'re playing this year.\\n\\nWhat about new songs?\\n\\nWe might have some snippets... That\\'s probably the most requested thing we get right now. And by requested, I know people are people are mad at me for taking so long to put out new music. I was speaking to my mother a week or two ago and she came at me about it: \"When are you gonna do a new album? It\\'s been so long since the last one!\" Like, geez mom...\\n\\nI think the older I get, the more critical I am of myself. I\\'m constantly playing guitar and I\\'m constantly writing music. But there\\'s the innate fear of repeating myself. It\\'s not an insecurity per se, but at this point there\\'s so much expectation that I want to make sure when it\\'s time for a new album, it\\'s not just a new album for the sake of having a new album -- that it\\'s something I can stand behind. For every album I do, the recording process takes months, if not years, because I\\'m so unfortunately meticulous. By the time the album is wrapping up, I\\'m about as close as a human can get to a nervous breakdown without having one. And I\\'m pretty much convinced: This is the last record I can put out; I can\\'t possibly write songs better than the ones I just wrapped up; I\\'m spent; I\\'m done. And of course I put together another album years later.\\n\\nSo I think I\\'m in that phase now where I\\'m starting to put together songs and sketch out what a new album is gonna look like. I\\'ve got a couple ideas that are definitely non-traditional. I think I\\'m gonna pursue those. It\\'s gonna be a little bit of a stretch, a little bit longer.\\n\\nI learned over the years not to talk about release dates and things I\\'m working on because I don\\'t want to make any more promises I end up not keeping. If there\\'s any sort of question about it, we absolutely are working on new music, I\\'ve got a couple non-traditional ideas I\\'m fleshing out now but I cannot -- for the sake of everyone\\' sanity -- give out any dates. Because of my history with dates.\\n\\nDoes being free of Victory Records make it easier for you to move forward with new music?\\n\\nI don\\'t know because we haven\\'t released anything since we left Victory... since the lawsuit that wrapped up... We all work on new stuff so when that stuff does come out, it\\'s gonna be a whole new ballgame for us because we\\'re gonna be behind every aspect of it, in terms of distribution and the release process. We got what we always wanted, which is absolute freedom -- not just from Victory -- but from everyone.\\n\\nNow, as of two years ago, Streetlight is completely independent. We owe nothing to anyone. No one takes a cut. No one pressures us to put out a new record, et cetera... We\\'ll see what it\\'s like to release a record without a record label when we do it soon... soon-ish! Shit, I sort of just gave the timeline.\\n\\nYes. [Victory] sued us. I\\'m not sure how much I can talk about. I\\'m not gonna say anything bad about Victory; I have no intention to... And that\\'s not because of the lawsuit. That\\'s more because of the way I look at life. I couldn\\'t stand them. Without naming names, they were my mortal enemies for 18 years of my life. They made my life excruciatingly difficult. On the other hand, I\\'m sure I made their lives difficult too.\\n\\nThinking of some of the people who just work there, who were expecting, for example, me to fulfill a date, and [I wasn\\'t able to] able to meet it. It was a very antagonistic relationship and I\\'m sure the blame falls on both sides. But once it was over, one of my few talents is the ability to walk away from things and never worry of think about them again.\\n\\nFrom interviews over the years, I\\'ve learned it wasn\\'t just Victory -- other established labels in that punk scene would use their allure to take advantage of young bands with terrible contracts.\\n\\nEspecially back before digital distribution and whatnot, you did need a record label to have any sort of success, or to make a career of music. Over the years that\\'s changed so much. As sad as it is for anyone\\'s business to go under... the saddest part is a lot of the people that work at the labels lost their jobs.\\n\\nBut I\\'d be lying if I said part of me wasn\\'t watching the whole label system, that whole ship sink, with glee to a degree. They got to do whatever they wanted for so long and always got the upper hand over bands. Then file sharing kicked in, digital distribution kicked in, the whole democratization of the music business kind of killed all of these companies who were really just bastards. A lot of these labels which called themselves \"punk rock labels,\" \"indie labels\" or whatever were worse [than major labels] from my observations.\\n\\nI only had experience with one label, but from my estimation a lot of these indies that hold up the, \"I\\'m your mom and pop record label\" flag were worse than the majors because they could hide behind that supposed innocence. A lot of them were shitting on their bands more than the major labels because with the majors, there was some sort of accountability. It wasn\\'t just some guy cooking the numbers in the backroom, where it could be that with a small label. I\\'m not saying that about all small labels -- there are definitely tons of altruistic independent record labels -- but I don\\'t think it\\'s enough to be like, \"We\\'re independent so you should just assume we do right by our bands.\"\\n\\nI really appreciate you doing this interview after doing so few in the past. So I gotta ask -- why have you avoided interviews for the past 10 years?\\n\\nOh man... You got another hour to talk about it? [Laughs.] I have a set of really peculiar beliefs about music and I\\'m clearly going against everything I\\'m about to tell you, everything I\\'ve believed for the last 15, 20 years.\\n\\nI believe in musicians making music. I don\\'t believe that because someone\\'s in a mildly successful band that they have the right to have access to some sort of celebrity. People tend to idolize people in bands and I\\'ve known enough people in bands, been backstage at a million festivals, and a lot of these bands that we grew up idolizing are crummy people. Or at the very least, they\\'re massively egotistical. I\\'m not saying I\\'m not a crummy person -- I\\'m not here to judge that about myself -- but I wanted to remove any sort of personal aspect.\\n\\nOn a very basic level, I don\\'t know people and people don\\'t know me. I\\'m a stranger to them and I don\\'t want them to think they know me through my songs. I wanted to remove anyone in the band\\'s personality from the larger picture. That\\'s the exact opposite of what everyone does these days on social media, over-sharing stuff. We don\\'t post pictures of our breakfast and vacations; we don\\'t talk about our religious or political beliefs.

U.S. immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the Attorney General can rule in cases to set legal precedent.\\n\\nBarr\\'s ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration. This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts, a policy which has been challenged with a lawsuit.\\n\\nSeveral top officials at the Department of Homeland Security were forced out this month over Trump\\'s frustrations with an influx of migrants seeking refuge at the U.S. southern border.\\n\\nBarr\\'s decision applies to migrants who crossed illegally into the United States.\\n\\nTypically, those migrants are placed in \"expedited removal\" proceedings - a faster form of deportation reserved for people who illegally entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles (160 km) of a land border. Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond.\\n\\nBut before Barr\\'s ruling, those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond, once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution.\\n\\n\"I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,\" Barr wrote.\\n\\nBarr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude, or if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decides to release them by granting them \"parole.\" DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons.\\n\\nBarr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days \"so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions.\"\\n\\nThe decision\\'s full impact is not yet clear, because it will in large part depend on DHS\\' ability to expand detention, said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.\\n\\n\"The number of asylum seekers who will remain in potentially indefinite detention pending disposition of their cases will be almost entirely a question of DHS\\'s detention capacity, and not whether the individual circumstances of individual cases warrant release or detention,\" Vladeck said.\\n\\nDHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. The agency had written in a brief in the case arguing that eliminating bond hearings for the asylum seekers would have \"an immediate and significant impact on...detention operations.\"\\n\\nIn early March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the DHS agency responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants in the country illegally, said the average daily population of immigrants in detention topped 46,000 for the 2019 fiscal year, the highest level since the agency was created in 2003. Last year, Reuters reported that ICE had modified a tool officers have been using since 2013 when deciding whether an immigrant should be detained or released on bond, making the process more restrictive.\\n\\nThe decision will have no impact on unaccompanied migrant children, who are exempt from expedited removal. Most families are also paroled because of a lack of facilities to hold parents and children together.\\n\\nMichael Tan, from the American Civil Liberties Union, said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision, and immigrant advocates decried the decision.\\n\\nBarr\\'s decision came after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to review the case in October. Sessions resigned from his position in November, leaving the case to Barr to decide.\\n\\n(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York and Kristina Cooke in San Francisco; additional reporting by Yeganeh Torbati in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)', 'source': {'uri': 'aol.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'AOL.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'kristina_cooke@aol.com', 'name': 'Kristina Cooke', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'mica_rosenberg@aol.com', 'name': 'Mica Rosenberg', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/4525x2368+0+0/resize/600x314!/format/jpg/quality/85/https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-images%2F2019-04%2F745815c0-60f3-11e9-b54f-e2a43dc296e7', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.03529411764705881, 'wgt': 139}\n",

The disaster accounted for nearly a fifth of the estimated 3,665 migrant deaths in the sea that year, as tallied by the International Organization for Migration.\\n\\nThe Tunisian captain of the fishing vessel was later sentenced to 18 years in prison after being found guilty of charges including multiple manslaughter and human trafficking.\\n\\nAt the time of the disaster, Mr. Büchel was working on a project for the 56th Venice Biennale: a working mosque inside a disused Venetian church that officials closed not long after its inauguration, citing security concerns.\\n\\nMr. Büchel made fresh headlines last year when he created an online petition to preserve and have designated as national monuments eight prototypes for President Trump\\'s proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico.\\n\\nThe Biennale piece seeks to be equally thought-provoking.\\n\\nIn June 2016, the wreck of the fishing vessel was recovered from the seabed and taken to a NATO base on Sicily, where teams of forensic scientists and experts began the difficult task of identifying the corpses that had been trapped in the hull.\\n\\nThe wreck\\'s symbolic power was immediately apparent, and various proposals were put forward regarding its future use. Italian news media reported in 2016 that the movie director Alejandro González Iñárritu wanted to display the boat in front of the Gothic cathedral in Milan to coincide with a visit by Pope Francis.\\n\\nBut Cettina Saraceno, a spokeswoman for the Comitato 18 Aprile, an association established to preserve the memory of the tragedy, said that Mr. Büchel had been the first artist to ask to use the vessel.\\n\\n\"It seemed to us like a valid project,\" Ms. Saraceno said in a telephone interview. The wreck has been entrusted to the Sicilian city of Augusta, which is working with the committee to find a space for it at the heart of what Ms. Saraceno said would be a \"garden of memory.\" The vessel will return to Augusta after the Biennale.\\n\\n\"It is the right moment\" for the Biennale project and for the garden, Ms. Saraceno said.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'elisabetta_povoledo@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Elisabetta Povoledo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/06/arts/06venice-boat-item1/06venice-boat-item1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.0980392156862745, 'wgt': 138}\n",

Americans continue to rely on Chinese-made products in their homes, at their offices, and in their pockets. If you live near a university, you can still bump into one of the 340,000 Chinese studying in the US. You can still take a Beijing-sponsored Chinese-language class at any of the 104 Confucius Institutes in 46 states.1\\n\\nEven if you\\'re not among the 114,000 Americans who work in the 2,400 Chinese-owned companies in this country, your livelihood still depends on China. As America\\'s largest trading partner and the largest foreign holder of US debt, China keeps the American economy afloat. Economically, the two nations are joined at the hip.2\\n\\nBut in virtually every other way, China and the United States are drifting apart, and this growing rift could have catastrophic consequences.3\\n\\n\"We are at war with China on at least two fronts: technology and trade,\" says Michael Klare, a military analyst and defense correspondent for The Nation. \"This is not peacetime in the way we once understood it. So the questions are when, and how, and if this war will enter new realms.\"4\\n\\nWashington and Beijing are currently battling over who will build the world\\'s next generation of digital infrastructure, with the United States trying to freeze out Chinese telecom giants like Huawei. The United States is afraid that if allies use Chinese technology, it could pose a security risk. Meanwhile, a trade war of escalating tariffs between the world\\'s two largest economies threatens to send global markets into a tailspin.5\\n\\nAnd in a significant departure from its predecessor\\'s version, the Trump administration\\'s National Security Strategy portrays China as a \"revisionist\" power that wants to \"shape a world antithetical to US values and interests.\" This document \"suggests that wherever China is active, the United States should push back,\" explains Melanie Hart, a China expert at the Center for American Progress. \"Wherever China is developing cooperation with other nations, that adds up to a threat to the United States. The National Security Strategy paints that in dire terms.\"6\\n\\nSimilarly, the foreign-policy elite in the United States has shifted away from compromise. Whereas a lively debate among China watchers once pitted those who favor engagement against those who champion containment -- the \"panda huggers\" versus the \"dragon slayers\" -- the consensus has now moved in a more combative direction.7\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen people who were generally positive about US-China relations all shifting a little more hawkish,\" observes Jennifer Turner, an expert on China and the environment at the Wilson Center. \"The general atmosphere in DC is that it\\'s not going well.\"8\\n\\nThis change in elite consensus, which extends to Congress as well, has been extraordinary in its pace and impact. Although it precedes the divisive efforts of the current administration, the more uncompromising stance on China of the expert class has ensured that Trump\\'s China initiatives have not generated the kind of pushback associated with the president\\'s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal or his cozier relationship with Saudi Arabia.9\\n\\nAs in the early stages of a divorce discussion, the two sides are trading accusations across every facet of the relationship: trade, security, human rights, technology. Both sides also recognize how costly this conflict could be. So, for the time being, they have settled into a tense cohabitation punctuated by raised voices and intemperate threats.10\\n\\nDivorce is not inevitable. But with China expected to overtake the United States in total economic output in the next decade -- and with bilateral competition sharpening over markets, resources, and geopolitical advantage -- Beijing and Washington may yet succumb to irreconcilable differences.11\\n\\nEven if the conflict doesn\\'t devolve into a shooting war, a sharp downturn in US-China relations could mean a global economic crisis, the unraveling of the multilateral order, the failure of the last best effort to stop climate change -- or a perfect storm of all three. The two largest economies in the world, with by far the two largest carbon footprints, have different views on how the world should be structured. If they can\\'t reach agreement on trade, the environment, and the global rules of the road, the divorce will tear apart what remains of the international community.12\\n\\nThe initial warming in US-China relations had a very public starting point: the visit by a team of American ping-pong players to China in April 1971, followed by President Richard Nixon\\'s groundbreaking trip the following February. For the next several decades, the United States applied two principles to its relations with Beijing. The US government, the business community, and the NGO sector made various pacific overtures to China. At the same time, the Pentagon consistently attempted to contain China\\'s reach and influence.13\\n\\nThe decline of this \"congagement\" approach is more difficult to pinpoint. The Obama administration certainly attempted to tweak the model with its \"Pacific pivot,\" an effort to refocus the Pentagon away from the Middle East to East Asia. However, the war in Syria and the rise of ISIS largely prevented this military reorientation. The economic component of the pivot gained greater traction: Obama brokered a free-trade agreement for the region, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), that pointedly excluded China.14\\n\\nAfter Donald Trump unexpectedly won the 2016 election, he adopted a far more aggressive approach toward China, beginning with his staff. Former top adviser Steve Bannon urged preparations for a coming war between the United States and an \"expansionist\" China in the South China Sea. \"The kinds of people that have taken senior positions on trade and national security are China hawks more eager to confront China,\" says Dennis Wilder, who served as the National Security Council\\'s director for China from 2004 to 2005.15\\n\\nOn trade, Trump complained about an undervalued yuan, barriers to entry into Chinese markets, and the theft of intellectual-property rights. But on the third day of his presidency, Trump withdrew from the TPP. Whatever the pluses and minuses of this agreement, US withdrawal provided China an opportunity to further deepen its economic ties in the region.16\\n\\nMore often than not, Trump\\'s obsession with destroying agreements brokered by the Obama administration has brought Washington into conflict with Beijing -- over the Iran nuclear deal, for instance, or on climate change. Nonetheless, Trump\\'s actions on China have elicited a surprising amount of praise from people who don\\'t ordinarily have anything nice to say about the president. As Thea Lee, the president of the progressive Economic Policy Institute, acknowledges, \"The one thing that the tariff actions have shown: Leverage works. They\\'ve gotten the attention of the Chinese government.\" (Though it should be acknowledged that Lee\\'s recommendations for how to use that leverage -- to advocate for stronger labor rights in China to build a middle class -- are not exactly the Trump administration\\'s priorities.)17\\n\\n\"Trump is a madman, but I want to give him and his administration their due,\" admits Orville Schell, a journalist who has covered China for decades and now directs the Center on US-China Relations at the Asia Society. \"We can\\'t keep playing on an unlevel playing field and take promises that are never delivered on. It\\'s really China\\'s turn to respond, and it\\'s long overdue.\"18\\n\\nTrump is presiding over Washington\\'s most assertive challenge to China in decades, and it\\'s a bipartisan confrontation. But what the United States says and does is only part of the story.19\\n\\nUntil relatively recently, China was outwardly content with being a junior partner -- or, occasionally, a junior adversary -- of the United States. In the 2000s, Chinese officials spoke of the country\\'s \"peaceful rise,\" as if it were interested only in getting along by going along.20\\n\\nThat has changed with Xi Jinping. The first Chinese president born after the 1949 revolution, Xi has steered the country in a different direction since he took over in 2012. After using an anti-corruption campaign to eliminate his rivals, Xi embarked on a set of reforms that consolidated his power, modernized the military, and reemphasized state control of the economy. In so doing, he has remade the very concept of leadership -- his own in China, and his country\\'s in the world.21\\n\\n\"In terms of the direction that Xi has taken the Chinese government, it is a change -- and a pretty dramatic one -- from the Deng Xiaoping reform and opening-up policies,\" Wilder observes. \"And not just reform and opening up, but also keeping the low profile of Deng\\'s two successors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin. Xi is a different kind of leader: He is more autocratic, and he believes in the reassertion of the [Communist] Party into all aspects of Chinese society and life.\"22\\n\\nThe most striking departure from that previous \"low-profile approach\" has been China\\'s greater assertiveness in the South China Sea. Beijing has declared ownership over just about everything that lies beyond the territorial waters of the surrounding countries. This is no minor waterway: One-third of global shipping passes through the South China Sea.23\\n\\nUnder Xi, China has begun to build artificial islands there, essentially creating 3,000 new acres of Chinese territory to cement its claims. Other countries have pushed back, particularly the Philippines, which brought suit against China in an international maritime court. In 2016, the UN-created court ruled against China, a decision that Beijing roundly criticized as \"destined to come to naught.\"24\\n\\n\"More than anything, what shifted, at least in terms of expert opinion, was China\\'s build-out of artificial islands in the South China Sea and the flouting of the permanent court of arbitration about that,\" observes Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center\\'s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States.25\\n\\nThen too, at the 19th Communist Party Congress in 2017, Xi \"took a highly nationalist approach, essentially defining Western influences as the enemy,\" says J. Stapleton Roy, a former US ambassador to China. Xi instructed the party \"to look into and provide guidance on everything -- politics, economics, math, philosophy, think tanks. All of these and more have to have Chinese characteristics.\"26\\n\\nActually, Xi may be even more ambitious: If successful, his efforts would ensure that the whole of the Asia Pacific region has Chinese characteristics. His Belt and Road Initiative is a grand infrastructure program that aspires to reconnect China with the Middle East and Europe via a new Silk Road, along with a maritime program that builds up the capacities of Beijing\\'s littoral neighbors. The project involves some 70 countries and as much as $1 trillion in funding (though it may not reach that figure for another few years). Xi has also created economic structures, like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to finance regional growth. These structures could one day serve as the center of an alternative global economy. After all, Chinese development loans already rival those of the World Bank.27\\n\\nAt the same time, China\\'s economic miracle, which has pulled an unprecedented number of people out of poverty, is slowing. The country\\'s economic growth has dropped to a low of between 6 and 6.6 percent this year -- and it could fall even further. \"There\\'s a huge private and public debt of around $34 trillion,\" points out sociologist Walden Bello, a human-rights activist and former member of the Philippine Congress. Among other things, the Belt and Road Initiative is a huge gamble aimed at priming the region\\'s economic pump and reinflating Chinese growth.28\\n\\nXi\\'s greater assertiveness -- his \"China dream\" of a \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\" -- has generated a reciprocal response from a number of other countries, but particularly the United States, with Trump\\'s own dream of a national resurgence. In what is perhaps the best-case scenario, two increasingly nationalistic superpowers with immense militaries and overextended economies might be content to maintain their own spheres of influence. But China wants to expand its sphere, and the United States is reluctant to give up either its Pacific presence or its global ambitions.29\\n\\nThere is another source of conflict. The United States doesn\\'t just want to box in China; it also wants to change China from within.30\\n\\nDuring the \"congagement\" years, a basic assumption lurked behind many US analyses of Chinese behavior: By introducing market capitalism and gradually liberalizing its politics and culture, China would become more Western. During the debate over China\\'s accession to the World Trade Organization, then-President Bill Clinton argued that the agreement \"will move China in the right direction. It will advance the goals America has worked for in China for the past three decades.... By joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products; it is agreeing to import one of democracy\\'s most cherished values: economic freedom.\"31\\n\\nAs Kurt Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Ely Ratner, a former State Department official, put it in an influential essay in Foreign Affairs last year: \"The assumption that deepening commercial, diplomatic, and cultural ties would transform China\\'s internal development and external behavior has been a bedrock of U.S. strategy. Even those in U.S. policy circles who were skeptical of China\\'s intentions still shared the underlying belief that U.S. power and hegemony could readily mold China to the United States\\' liking.\" When China proved to be not quite so pliable, American observers started to question the virtues of engagement.32\\n\\nThe Chinese, too, held certain basic assumptions about the stability and coherence of US policy, and Trump\\'s erratic conduct has thrown them for a loop. But even before Trump or Xi, the global financial crisis of 2008 was a wake-up call. \"They were true believers that we were the masters of the financial universe,\" Roy says. \"They were disillusioned by the international financial crisis.\"33\\n\\nAs Jian Yong, director of the Center for Economic Security Studies of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, wrote at the time: \"The worsening US subprime crisis puts China\\'s enormous US dollar assets and its opening financial market at tremendous risk. It also makes more Chinese people think about ways to prevent financial crises from spreading across the world amid globalization.\"34\\n\\nFor the Chinese economy to continue growing, in other words, Beijing could no longer safely assume a well-functioning global system. It could no longer sit comfortably in the passenger seat and expect a smooth ride. With its Belt and Road Initiative, its alternative financing structures, its environmental initiatives, and its efforts to become a global leader in technology, China has seized the wheel. More to the point, Beijing is using its newfound power to change the rules of the road.35\\n\\nThis emerging Chinese economic alternative, with its emphasis on the role of the state, \"is positive as a sort of counterweight to the neoliberal institutions, with all their conditionalities about how countries should develop along Western market lines,\" Bello says. \"However, these institutions and Chinese lending have also had drawbacks of their own.\"36\\n\\nOne of those drawbacks are the high rates on some of China\\'s loans, as Sri Lanka recently discovered. At the end of 2017, unable to repay its various debts, the Sri Lankan government gave Beijing a 99-year lease to the Hambantota port, which was built with Chinese financing. It\\'s a commercial port, but it could be used for military purposes with Sri Lanka\\'s consent.37\\n\\nIn the security realm, China increased its military spending by double digits for many years, though it has fallen to 7.5 percent for 2019. \"Clearly, the Chinese leadership intends for China to be a great power, to command respect, to bury the century of humiliation that they\\'re still quite sensitive to,\" says historian Andrew Bacevich. \"But does it follow that they want to take over the world and create a global empire?\"38\\n\\nLyle Goldstein, who teaches at the US Naval War College, challenges the notion of \"Chinese aggression.\" He says that China might push around smaller countries, but it has generally showed considerable restraint. \"If there\\'s one thing that China has done that\\'s so horrible over the last 10 years, that has shocked people in the national-security realm, it would be its behavior in the South China Sea,\" Goldstein says. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s so threatening to the United States. I don\\'t think it\\'s that threatening to countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. What does it show? Chinese engineering prowess. A concern about their sea lanes. They haven\\'t killed anyone, resorting for the most part to deploying coast-guard cutters with water cannons. That\\'s a decent record of moderation for a great power.\"39\\n\\nThe one area where China has unquestionably become a leader is on the environment, especially given the steps backward that the Trump administration has taken. \"China is becoming much more of a truly global player,\" Turner says. \"Ten or 15 years ago, at a lot of these environmental conferences, they just said no. At the fisheries conference, they said, \\'No, we need to fish.\\' What China wants to do these days is set the norms.\"40\\n\\nBarbara Finamore, Asia senior strategic director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, acknowledges that China still has a ways to go to wean itself off dirty energy and \"green\" its overseas development projects. But China has largely kept to the clean-energy path, she argues, \"because it\\'s in its own self-interest to do so. The reason for its transformation from a climate foot-dragger to an advocate of global climate governance is because it sees action on clean energy and the environment as fundamental to succeeding economically and putting its economy on a sustainable path moving forward.\"41\\n\\nUnwilling to wait for the \"invisible hand\" of the market to allocate resources to clean energy, the Chinese government has, for instance, invested huge sums in solar- and wind-power production. As a result, Chinese companies have cornered the global market on solar-cell production, and China has more wind-power capacity than anywhere else in the world.42\\n\\nIn other realms of global governance, China\\'s impatience with the rules of the liberal world order has less salutary implications. \"If you look deeply at Xi\\'s calls for China to lead reform of the global system, what they are saying is terrifying,\" argues Hart of the Center for American Progress. \"They want to make the world system more authoritarian so that China can integrate without facing political concerns.\"43\\n\\nHart points to China\\'s preference for states to define Internet freedom within their own borders. Similarly, Beijing wants to define what human rights mean inside China and rewrite rather than accede to global laws and regulations. Beijing is largely deaf to the global outcry over the situation in Xinjiang, where authorities have placed as many as 1.5 million Muslim Uighurs in \"reeducation camps\" and expanded an intrusive household-surveillance system. \"Tibet has served as a brutal testing ground for social control for decades,\" says Marin Ping, co-founder of Re:Public, a progressive foreign-policy collective, \"and the concentration camps in Xinjiang may constitute the single greatest crime against humanity currently being orchestrated and executed by state actors.\"44\\n\\nChina is not alone in its insistence on a rather 19th-century understanding of sovereignty, especially in terms of human rights. Donald Trump in the United States, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, and Vladimir Putin in Russia are all dismissive of the international community\\'s \"interference.\" \"China is beginning to feel and act in a way that reflects a sense that things are blowing its way when it comes to this area of human rights,\" Bello concludes.45\\n\\nThe United States is no longer the world\\'s sole superpower. The anxiety that accompanies Americans\\' realization of the relative decline of US global influence has produced a number of symptoms: the election of Trump, a preoccupation with borders and immigration, bipartisan support in Congress for greater military spending -- and a fixation on China\\'s growing power.46\\n\\n\"As liberal-minded Americans despair at what is happening to their own country and its political system, China\\'s rise under Xi\\'s authoritarian grip induces a fear and anxiety that is as much about the United States as it is about China,\" John Delury, a historian of modern China at Yonsei University, points out by e-mail.47\\n\\nSusan Shirk, former deputy assistant secretary of state during the Clinton administration, warns against inflating these fears and imposing self-defeating restrictions on Chinese people and businesses coming to the United States. \"It could lead to an anti-Chinese version of the Red Scare,\" she notes.48\\n\\nMeanwhile, the United States has launched a potentially budget-busting effort to maintain military supremacy over China (and everyone else on the planet). The Trump administration wants to increase the Pentagon\\'s budget to $750 billion a year, with much of that focused on China: the nearly 5 percent increase in the Navy\\'s budget, the modernization of the US nuclear force, the resurrection of fighter-jet production. As acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan reminded Pentagon staffers on his first day on the job: \"China, China, China.\"49\\n\\nThat way lies insolvency, Klare argues: \"Overmatching ISIS will never bankrupt us. Overmatching Russia and China will.\"50\\n\\nGiven this new reality, there are two kinds of options for a progressive rethinking of US-China relations. The minimum approach, which acknowledges that the US government and the foreign-policy community have become leery of large-scale engagement, offers only case-by-case cooperation. \"Our policy should be cooperative partnership that engages China on every level as we seek to work with China to solve problems,\" argues the US Naval War College\\'s Goldstein. \"They are a status-quo power that we can work with on various fronts: North Korea, Myanmar, pandemics, Belt and Road, climate change.\"51\\n\\nThat engagement can even extend to difficult issues like human rights. \"You do stand on your principles on questions of human rights, but you realize your limitations, since it\\'s not possible for outside states to engineer the situation inside China,\" says Rajan Menon, who teaches at the City University of New York. \"It\\'s a delicate balance between standing up for what progressives believe in, but also guarding against those issues being used for confrontation against China.\"52\\n\\nThis minimum approach falls somewhere between the \"congagement\" strategy of the past and the creation of distinct spheres of influence. It\\'s neither a divorce nor a renewal of the wedding vows; it\\'s more like the Chinese adage of \"same bed, different dreams.\" There\\'s room for cooperation, but also for considerable conflict.53\\n\\nThe maximum approach, meanwhile, would be a heavier lift. It requires the United States and China to discuss the underlying tension in their relationship over two different views of global governance. A similar debate took place in 1945 between the capitalist and communist worlds, and it produced the compromises of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today, the discussion would cover the balance of state and market in economic development, the tension between national sovereignty and universal human rights, and the restructuring of international institutions to better reflect the new balance of global power. The People\\'s Republic of China, which didn\\'t exist in 1945 but has now graduated to superpower status, expects to play the same role in reshaping the international system that the United States did after World War II.54\\n\\nInstead of engaging China in a conversation about such a transformation -- or even just cooperating with it on an ad-hoc basis, as the Obama administration did -- the Trump administration is simultaneously challenging Beijing and shrugging off the burdens of global leadership. Such a mixed message is straining the marriage of convenience between Washington and Beijing that has dominated the world order since the end of the Cold War.55\\n\\nSince it touches on the global economy, the environment, military conflict, and the latest technologies, the US-China relationship should be at the front and center of public debate. Yet no one in Washington or among the 2020 presidential candidates is discussing new ways to engage with China. The stakes, however, couldn\\'t be higher: If this marriage dissolves, we can say goodbye to a world order that has come to depend on a measure of US-Chinese amity.56', 'source': {'uri': 'thenation.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Nation'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'john_feffer@thenation.com', 'name': 'John Feffer', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/China-Feffer-ftr_img.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4713435', 'sentiment': -0.1294117647058823, 'wgt': 134}\n",

Now Pay Back Your Travel Loans', 'body': 'A few years ago, when Rana Safieh learned that the United States had given her family refugee status, she was overjoyed.\\n\\nIn 2012, Ms. Safieh fled Syria with her four children after their house was bombed. Since then, Ms. Safieh, who had been an elementary schoolteacher in Damascus, had been living with her mother outside of Cairo. The money she\\'d saved from selling off her jewelry had run out, and she could find only part-time work. Ms. Safieh\\'s children were unable to attend Egyptian schools because of their immigration status.\\n\\nIn December 2016, as the family finally prepared to leave Egypt for the United States, Ms. Safieh signed a promissory note to repay a travel loan, offered by the International Organization for Migration on behalf of the State Department, which would cover their airline tickets.\\n\\n\"I was so happy I didn\\'t pay attention to how much they would charge me,\" Ms. Safieh said in Arabic over the phone from Albany, where she now lives. \"I just wanted to leave.\"\\n\\nAbout seven months later, Ms. Safieh started getting notices in the mail about paying back the $5,356 loan.\\n\\n\"I almost had a heart attack,\" she said.\\n\\nFor decades, the State Department has funded interest-free travel loans to refugees who, like Ms. Safieh, cannot afford the cost of relocating here. Six months after their arrival, borrowers are expected to start repaying the loans to one of nine private nonprofits, known as resettlement agencies, which are involved in helping refugees start their new lives here. When refugees make their travel plans, they are assigned one of these resettlement agencies through the International Organization for Migration, which administers the travel loans.\\n\\nThe average loan per person is $1,100, and that amount can quickly increase when considering a full family. Meanwhile the resettlement agencies, including World Relief, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the International Rescue Committee, all of which collect the travel loan payments but have nothing to do with granting them to begin with, retain up to 25 percent of the total payments.\\n\\nAccording to the most recent data from the State Department, in 2017, refugees made over $66 million in loan repayments. Of that amount, a bit over $14 million went to the resettlement agencies.\\n\\nSome advocates think that these agencies should not be taking money from those they are trying to help. The nonprofits involved claim that these fees go toward their administration costs and programming, all of which is focused on giving refugees long-term financial security.\\n\\nAfter coming to Rochester from Kenya, Sadiya Omar, 52, is finally enjoying some stability. She immigrated in 2002 with her three children, following a decade of living in a Somali refugee camp. Her travel loan was more than $3,000. Repaying it became a four-year ordeal.\\n\\n\"I worked two low-paid jobs, seven days a week,\" said Ms. Omar, whose monthly payments of $70 came on top of bills, rent, child-care costs and the money she wired to her parents back in Kenya.\\n\\nToday, Ms. Omar\\'s children are almost done with college. She is now the vice-president and co-founder of Refugees Helping Refugees, a Rochester-based nonprofit that, among other services, helps Western New York refugees renegotiate the terms of their loans with billing agencies.\\n\\n\"I spoke English before I came here, which is why I was able to get a job after two months,\" she recalled. Ms. Omar said that those who have to learn the language often struggle to find work in time for their first repayment.\\n\\nThis is what happened to Baydaa Majeed. Her family had relocated from Baghdad to Brooklyn in late 2015. When the newcomers were asked to start repaying their loan of almost $5,800, they were all still unemployed.\\n\\n\"It was really stressful,\" said Ms. Majeed, a college graduate who, because of the language barrier, had failed to land even entry-level positions in retail.\\n\\nThe Majeeds were granted a three-month deferral of payments, but when the bills started coming again at the end of that period, Ms. Majeed and her relatives still hadn\\'t found work. Eventually, the family heard of an initiative by the Arab-American Family Support Center, a New York-based nonprofit, which would ultimately settle their debt.\\n\\nRawaa Nancy Albilal, president and chief executive of the Support Center, said that travel loans put refugee families under incommensurable stress. She questions whether resettlement agencies should be taking a commission on repayments, as the practice, she said, \"defeats the purpose of their mission.\"\\n\\nEskinder Negash, the president and chief executive of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the agency assigned to collect payments from both Ms. Safieh and the Majeeds, argues that the fee is fair; if the State Department requires refugees to pay back their loans, his nonprofit should be allowed to recoup its costs, which include paying three full-time employees who coordinate the repayments.\\n\\n\"The question is whether we should charge refugees for their transportation to begin with,\" Mr. Negash said.\\n\\nAccording to a spokeswoman for the State Department, which, it must be said, takes a loss in the travel loan transactions, having refugees pay for their travel expenses helps defray resettlement costs and can strengthen the newcomers\\' resolve for a successful migration.\\n\\nThe department maintains that the loans are designed to encourage repayments without placing undue hardship on refugees, as interest-free deferments and reduced monthly payments are easily granted to struggling debtors. In the process, newcomers are given an opportunity to become financially literate and build up their credit history.\\n\\nThe opposite is also true, however, as missed payments can affect credit scores.\\n\\nTo date, slightly over 18 percent of all the loans issued to refugees in 2016 did not receive a single payment, according to data from the State Department. These missed payments were reported to credit agencies. For a while, Ms. Safieh, who ultimately found a part-time job as an Arabic teacher, was nearly $800 behind on loan payments. She still needs to repay over $3,500.\\n\\n\"When you don\\'t have much, it\\'s hard to pay for anything,\" Ms. Safieh said. \"Frankly, I don\\'t know what to do.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'fabrice_robinet@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Fabrice Robinet', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/17/nyregion/17refugeeloan/15refugeeloan-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 127}\n",

It has put this technique to use with Asean, the Southeast Asian association, using bilateral deals to divide members. Judging by the tone of President Xi Jinping\\'s visit to Italy and France over the past week, China has adopted the same approach in Europe -- this time pitting the Italian government, which is anti-European Union, against the pro-E.U. French government of Emmanuel Macron, among others.\\n\\nAs expected, Italy signed a wide-ranging memorandum of understanding, or M.O.U., with China, becoming the first major Western economy to endorse Beijing\\'s colossal and controversial \"One Belt, One Road\" infrastructure initiative. Most contentious, perhaps, was the Italian government\\'s decision to grant a Chinese state-owned company access to two ports, including one used by the United States Navy that is just 100 kilometers from NATO\\'s largest air base in the Mediterranean region.\\n\\nBut did Mr. Xi really get out of Italy what he came for?\\n\\nSince June 2018, when the awkward motley coalition formed by the populist Five Star Movement and the extreme-right, anti-immigration League came to power, the Italian government has been as triumphalist as its politics have been amateurish and confused. The same goes for its recent dealings with Mr. Xi.\\n\\nEssential terms of the M.O.U. -- and of the 29 contracts signed along with it, which range from the frivolous to the reckless -- are exceedingly vague. In fact, some commitments are inherently noncommittal.\\n\\nSicilian blood oranges are to be flown to China for distribution by the e-commerce giant Alibaba. The cities of Verona and Hangzhou have been twinned, as have the region of Langhe with its vineyards and that of Yunnan province and its rice terraces. New media partnerships, including with Chinese state news outlets, were announced -- even as, on the margins of a meeting Friday between Mr. Xi and the Italian president at the presidential palace in Rome, a member of the Chinese embassy\\'s staff told an Italian journalist to stop \"writing critically about China.\" The M.O.U. mentions \"synergies,\" \"reciprocal interests\" and \"collaboration\" -- notably regarding infrastructure, energy and telecommunications -- while skipping over crucial details. (So, Chinese 5G technology or not?)\\n\\nThe risks for Italy seem plain, but there are pitfalls for China, too. A provision in the M.O.U. stipulates that either party can back out of the agreement by giving just three months\\' notice. Another section states that the deal is not legally binding.\\n\\nChina, which is eager to sell more of its products in more markets, is urging the Italian government to finally push through a plan for a high-speed rail link between Turin, Italy, and Lyon, France. That project has been a bane of Italian politicians for two decades, repeatedly blocked by activists opposing its costs and its possible environmental impact. It remains an issue today, notably for a part of the Five Star Movement\\'s core constituency. China\\'s global ambitions will also have to contend with local politics.\\n\\nFor all the pomp surrounding Mr. Xi\\'s welcome last week -- royal honors, mounted guards, a soul-rending performance by the tenor Andrea Bocelli -- Matteo Salvini, one of Italy\\'s two deputy prime ministers and its interior minister, skipped the festivities altogether.\\n\\nAs Mr. Xi was arriving in Rome on Thursday evening, Mr. Salvini, who heads the League, left the city to campaign for regional elections in Basilicata, in the southeast. On Saturday, the day the M.O.U. was signed, he attended an industrial forum in Lombardia, his home province, where he said: \"Do not tell me that China is a free market. Italy loses 60 billion euros a year to Chinese counterfeits.\" As Mr. Xi was wrapping up his visit Sunday morning, Mr. Salvini posed with a cow and tweeted the picture with a kiss emoji saying \"Happy Sunday from us.\"\\n\\nHere is Italy\\'s most popular politician spurning his own government\\'s most important international agreement to date. Why? Does Mr. Salvini want to claim plausible deniability should any of the deals Italy has signed with China go sour or displease voters?\\n\\nIf nothing else, his snubs and provocations suggest major divisions, or at least deep confusion, within the Italian government. It should concern China to have such a partner.\\n\\nAfter the general elections last year, Italy struggled for several months to form a government, and the void allowed political novices to find their way to important positions. Among these is Michele Geraci, a former economics professor and trader who spent a decade in China. Today he is the main force behind Italy\\'s participation in One Belt, One Road, and under secretary of state at the Ministry of Economic Development, where he oversees international trade and heads a new China task force. Since assuming that post, he has said, \"we are all Sino-Italians.\" He has also asked his staff to forgo WhatsApp in favor of WeChat, a Chinese messaging app riddled with security loopholes.\\n\\nMr. Geraci\\'s Sinophilia couldn\\'t stand in starker contrast to Mr. Salvini\\'s \"Italians first\" slogan, yet both men are prominent League members.\\n\\nThat divergence is only one example of the messiness of Italian politics today. Against that backdrop, Mr. Xi may have come out of his visit to Italy looking like the only adult in the room. But that doesn\\'t mean he is in control or will get what he wants. If the Italian government is an unreliable partner for its own constituents, other Europeans and NATO, it may be for China as well.\\n\\nIlaria Maria Sala is an Italian journalist based in Hong Kong.\\n\\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

With lawmakers hoping to wrap up this year\\'s session by Wednesday, the sponsor of the measure said it\\'s dead.\\n\\nThe Arkansas Municipal League, which opposed the measure, has said it doesn\\'t know of any sanctuary cities in the state or any cities moving toward adopting such policies. The Republican proponents of the bill said the measure was needed to ensure cities comply with federal law.\\n\\n\"This is not a solution looking for a problem,\" Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, the bill\\'s sponsor, told the panel before the vote. \"This is to ward off what is happening all over our country.\"\\n\\nRepublicans in several states have enacted bans on sanctuary cities, which have been targeted by President Donald Trump. Virginia\\'s Democratic governor last month vetoed a similar bill, and another bill is pending before Florida lawmakers.\\n\\nUnder Arkansas\\' bill, a city would have been ineligible for discretionary funds administered by the state if the attorney general found it was a sanctuary city. The bill also would have prohibited cities from preventing local law enforcement from asking people about their citizenship or immigration status.\\n\\nGov. Asa Hutchinson said earlier Monday he was generally supportive of the measure and opposed sanctuary cities. But Hutchinson said he\\'d asked the bill\\'s sponsor to amend the measure to require probable cause before law enforcement asked about citizenship or immigration status.\\n\\n\"Without this amendment, there is too much opportunity for racial profiling,\" Hutchinson said in a statement released by his office. Stubblefield, however, didn\\'t change the measure and said he believed it had sufficient protections against profiling.\\n\\nAdvocates in Arkansas said the defeated bill would have created mistrust between the immigrant community and law enforcement.\\n\\n\"Laws like this, because they are broad, they are vague and they are not clear, only exposes us to lawsuits, only exposes us to continued stereotypes of Arkansas being racist and only is going to hurt what really could be an opportunity for Arkansas to achieve a greater potential,\" Mireya Reith, founding executive director of Arkansas United, an immigrant advocacy group, told the panel before the vote.', 'source': {'uri': 'nypost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'New York Post'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@nypost.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/190409-ice-agent.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200', 'eventUri': 'eng-4714426', 'sentiment': -0.1529411764705882, 'wgt': 117}\n",

Yes. And No.\", 'body': 'There are 8.4 million people in the Naked City. This is the story of 40,000 of them -- the number of people the Census Bureau estimates that New York City lost last year.\\n\\nThe loss suggests that New York\\'s robust post-recession expansion since 2010 has finally slowed, halting what the city\\'s leading demographer had called a \"remarkable growth story.\"\\n\\nBut city officials disputed the Census Bureau\\'s findings, calling them \"tenuous\" at best. They said New York\\'s population may not have fallen, and suggested that the census numbers may be skewed, in part, because of a change in the survey\\'s methodology.\\n\\n\"Our team is very much questioning those results and the methodology that was used,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \"Every indicator we have seen in recent years is of steady growth.\"\\n\\nAt stake is more than simply bragging rights: Next year\\'s decennial census, which is supposed to count everyone in the country, will determine the size of the New York congressional delegation and the distribution of billions of dollars in federal aid. The city is projected to lose two seats in the House of Representatives after the 2020 count.\\n\\nThe estimated decline, to 8,398,748 from a record 8.4 million in 2017, covers the year ending on July 1, 2018. It amounts to 39,523 New Yorkers, or fewer than live in Co-op City in the Bronx.\\n\\nThe loss breaks down to 18,000 in Queens, 13,500 in Brooklyn, 7,500 in the Bronx and 1,000 in Manhattan. Staten Island recorded a gain of 663.\\n\\nThe latest figures suggest that population shifts in New York reverted to what had been a conventional pattern: Typically, more New Yorkers move to other parts of the United States than come from elsewhere in the country. But immigration from abroad usually makes up that loss, and tends to push the city\\'s population higher.\\n\\nThis time, 137,000 more New Yorkers left the city for other parts of the country -- retiring or moving to less expensive cities in the Sun Belt -- than arrived from someplace else in the United States. The net increase in international migration was only about 49,000.\\n\\nJoseph J. Salvo, the chief demographer for the Department of City Planning, acknowledged that the rate of population growth in the city has slackened, but challenged the latest estimate\\'s bottom line.\\n\\n\"There is a very real possibility that the population did not decline,\" he said on Thursday. \"We think the population is higher than 8.4 million.\"\\n\\nOne reason, he said, is the change in methodology meant to make one of the American Community Survey questions less ambiguous. Instead of asking people born abroad when they arrived in the United States, the bureau based its latest count on a more specific question: It asked where they lived a year ago.\\n\\n\"Our feeling is that the number for net international migration is likely too low because the new method tends to produce a lower figure,\" Dr. Salvo said.\\n\\nHe said the new method, while more conservative, may prove to be more accurate.\\n\\n\"The estimation methodology for net international migration has changed significantly, resulting in a revised 2010-2017 international migration estimate that is 31 percent lower than the previous vintage,\" a Planning Department analysis said.\\n\\n\"While the previous vintage estimated international net migration for the city at 624,000,\" the analysis added, \"the latest vintage provides a lower estimate of 431,000 over the same period, which are likely too low.\"\\n\\n\"The Census Bureau\\'s methodology is not robust enough to precisely quantify the magnitude of these year-to-year changes,\" the City Planning Department\\'s analysis of the latest estimate said.\\n\\nIn the year ending July 1, 2017, every borough recorded growth. The Bronx recorded the largest increase of any New York State county, up 6.2 percent.\\n\\nEven under the adjusted method, since the 2010 census the city gained 223,000 residents, or 2.7 percent -- about 27,000 people annually.\\n\\nA net loss of 768,000 through domestic migration was offset by a net gain of 480,000 immigrants from abroad and by more births than deaths.\\n\\n\"I would say to all New Yorkers that what we see with our own eyes appears to be the real truth -- that our population has been steadily growing,\" the mayor said. \"I\\'m sure there\\'s some outflow, but from everything I\\'m seeing it\\'s being more than made up for by the inflow.\"\\n\\nThe New York metropolitan area, which includes parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, remained the nation\\'s most populous. It recorded a slight decline to 19,979,000 people.\\n\\nAn analysis by William H. Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\\'s Metropolitan Policy Program, found that population losses in the region were driven by the decline in the city, as New Yorkers moved away from the metropolitan area entirely.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'sam_roberts@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Sam Roberts', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/18/nyregion/18nycensus/18nycensus-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4734810', 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 117}\n",

But it is a lifeline for its regulars.\\n\\nNew York City has thousands of buses that trek across the city -- often in slow motion -- on routes that stretch up to nearly 20 miles. Along the way, they make dozens of stops.\\n\\nThen there is the B39. It goes all of 1.8 miles and makes just three stops.\\n\\nThis little-known bus travels from one side of the Williamsburg Bridge to the other before circling back, like a windup toy stuck on an endless loop between the edges of Brooklyn and Manhattan.\\n\\nRound and round it goes. It crosses the East River 58 times a day, less often in bad traffic.\\n\\nOnly about 220 people ride the bus on a weekday, the city\\'s lowest daily bus ridership. It is a money loser for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\\n\\nBut for its regular riders the bus is a lifeline. It carries those in wheelchairs, a vital option when the elevator at the closest subway station is not working. It allows the frail, the old and the sick to rest their feet. (Getting a seat is never a problem.) It is an alternative, and an escape, from the crowded subway lines, walkway and bike path that also cross the bridge.\\n\\n\"This bus is very important to a lot of us,\" said Herbert King, 75, whose walker was parked next to his bus seat. \"If it weren\\'t for this bus, we\\'d all be in trouble because what are we going to depend on?\"\\n\\nEven as cities across the country overhaul outdated bus systems to become more efficient, there are some distinctive bus routes that add a bit of character to the public transit experience.\\n\\nThey may be short -- barely going anywhere. They may draw relatively few riders. They can seem unnecessary especially when there are other, faster transit options. Some are downright quirky.\\n\\nIn Houston, Route 311 runs only on the first Tuesday of every month to take potential bidders about a mile from a transit center to a public auction where county officials sell off real estate properties with unpaid tax bills. There have been four to 113 riders a day, depending on what is for sale.\\n\\nDenver has a fleet of free electric buses that only run along a single downtown street, making 18 stops in one mile, or on nearly every block, to provide door-to-door service to local businesses. In sprawling Los Angeles, the 601 bus goes a mere 2.7 miles in a loop that connects a transit hub with an office park, a shopping mall and a medical center in the San Fernando Valley.\\n\\nIn Seattle, three buses serving routes 118 and 119 actually roll on to a ferry from downtown to Vashon Island in Puget Sound. \"This may be one of the only places in the world where an in-service bus travels on a ferry,\" said Jeff Switzer, a spokesman for the transit authority.\\n\\nNew York\\'s B39 is all that remains of the trolley car system across the Williamsburg Bridge, which opened in 1903, and carried many immigrants from the tenements of the Lower East Side to Brooklyn and beyond.\\n\\nThere was a \"living connection between the two sides\" of the East River as families crossed back and forth to work, visited relatives and friends, worshiped at synagogues and even took English lessons, said David Favaloro, the director of curatorial affairs for the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side.\\n\\nThe trolleys were replaced in 1948 by buses. A New York Times article noted that \"no ceremony marked the changeover to bus service with the first of 27 new streamlined vehicles.\"\\n\\nToday, the B39 fleet has shrunk to just a single bus that runs every half-hour from about 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. It is the second shortest of the M.T.A.\\'s more than 300 bus routes. The shortest is the 1.3-mile B42 route that connects Canarsie, Brooklyn, to a subway station and bus transfer hub. The longest is the S78\\'s 19.5-mile trip across Staten Island with 117 stops. The average route is six miles.\\n\\nThe transportation authority spends $565,000 annually to operate the B39. With a total of 74,000 passengers in all of 2018 -- down from 104,000 in 2014 -- it would have collected only $203,500 if everyone paid the full fare of $2.75. (Of course, the authority loses money on many bus routes).\\n\\nThe B39 was supposed to be suspended as part of the shutdown of the L line, which links Brooklyn and Manhattan. The plan was to replace it temporarily with expanded bus service to carry displaced L train riders. But like many commuters, the B39 received a reprieve when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo intervened at the last minute to avert a full shutdown.\\n\\nIt was the second close call for the B39. In 2010, the bus route was eliminated in sweeping budget cuts. But riders rose up in protest, the authority relented and the bus was restored in 2013.\\n\\nJoseph P. Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University in Chicago who has studied urban bus systems, said that such little-used routes can be \"alarmingly expensive.\" Cities often hang on to them even when they no longer make economic sense to avoid backlash from a small number of loyal riders, he said.\\n\\n\"In a city like New York, in which congestion is acute and transportation needs are enormous, there is generally little justification for maintaining bus lines that move only a handful of people per trip,\" he said.\\n\\nThe B39 starts in Brooklyn at the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza, at the foot of the bridge, and then crosses the river and makes two stops on the Lower East Side. Then it swings around and stops twice to pick up passengers as it heads back to the bridge plaza.\\n\\n\"The B39 provides a critical connection between Brooklyn and Manhattan for customers who need additional accessibility options,\" said Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the transportation authority, pointing out that the bus also allows riders to make Manhattan connections to the Financial District or to the Upper East Side.\\n\\nPete Lopez, 63, a retired teacher in Williamsburg who has been riding the B39 for decades, said he has come to rely on it because he has trouble walking -- \"my feet gave up on me\" -- and does not want to attempt the stairs at subway stations. \"It\\'s my buddy,\" he said. \"I need this bus, and as I get older, I need it more.\"\\n\\nOther regulars said that hopping onto the B39 is far more pleasant than squeezing onto the subway. \"You don\\'t have to wait with a lot of people,\" said Anna Marte, 62, a Lower East Side resident who takes the bus at least once a week. \"Nobody pushes you.\"\\n\\nBut Ms. Marte does have to wait. With only one bus running, there can be long delays if it gets trapped in traffic on the bridge. After waiting 40 minutes the other day, Ms. Marte finally gave up and headed to the subway. It would be another 10 minutes before the B39 turned up. By then, no one was at the stop.\\n\\nAngel Arroyo, who was behind the wheel of the B39, recalled that a cement truck broke down on the bridge a few months ago and had to be towed. He was delayed by nearly an hour. \"No one else was on the bus -- that was a good thing, otherwise, it would have been, \\'Let me off, I\\'ll swim,\\'\" he said. \"You can\\'t do anything about it. You just have to sit there and wait it out.\\'\\'\\n\\nMr. Arroyo, 52, said he does not mind driving in circles. Where else, he said, would he have panoramic river views at his feet? \"Sometimes you want to get away from the hustle and bustle,\" he said. \"For me, this is peace of mind.\"\\n\\nThe bus ride is comforting, as well, for many of Mr. Arroyo\\'s regulars. Most are over 50, including a 94-year-old man who takes the bus to church every Sunday. Some stand up in front with him after swiping their fare cards to talk.\\n\\n\"We\\'re like a family on the bus -- everybody knows everybody,\" said Jeffrey Brown, 61, as he rolled onto the bus in a wheelchair.\\n\\nRead more about New York City\\'s busesAs Subway Crisis Takes Up \\'So Much Oxygen,\\' the Buses Drag AlongMarch 8, 2018This Commuter Bus Took Nearly 3 Hours to Get to Manhattan.

The sting nabbed more than 600 people, mostly Indian citizens.\\n\\nICE created the fake university in 2015, though it mostly existed online in the form of a fake website. An indictment filed in January shows the government claimed enrolling students knew the school was fake, and wanted to use it to maintain their visa status. But in February, the Detroit Free Press reported on emails that showed how the fake university lured and seemingly deceived enrolling students.\\n\\nAt the time Amer Zahr, a University of Detroit-Mercy adjunct law professor and a spokesperson for the detained enrollees told the Free Press that the emails showed ICE was going after legitimate students. \"It seems quite clear the scheme was set up by the government not to go after legitimate offenders, but to create fear in our immigration system,\" Zahr told the Free Press. \"This is who they\\'re choosing to go after? It\\'s really disturbing.\"\\n\\nThe Guardian\\'s investigation reportedly uncovered a new element of the scheme: fake Facebook profiles created by ICE. The newspaper reports that in a network of unusual accounts associated with the fake university, it found a profile for the alleged college president Ali \"AJ\" Milani. The Guardian also found that someone listed as Carey Ferrante used three stock photos for their profile images and interacted with people interested in the school. Those two accounts were friends with several other apparently fake accounts.\\n\\nEdward Bajoka, an attorney for one of the people criminally indicted from the University of Farmington sting confirmed to The Guardian that the accounts for Ali \"AJ\" Milani and Carey Ferrante were owned by the government.\\n\\nICE did not respond to a Gizmodo request for comment.

They were detained on April 16 for trying to cross the border near Sunland Park, N.M. The woman filming, who identifies herself as Debbie Collins Farnsworth, was there alongside the United Constitutional Patriots, a collection of armed Americans who took it upon themselves to hold the migrants until Border Patrol officers arrived.\\n\\nThe group had an encampment on land owned by the Union Pacific Railroad and had been working, reportedly, alongside the Border Patrol. (Some members also wore badges resembling law enforcement badges. If immigrants \"can\\'t tell the difference,\" the group\\'s \"commander\" told Buzzfeed, \"that\\'s their problem.\") The Border Patrol denies it tacitly supports the group, but in the video, one of its agents appears to exchange friendly conversation with Farnsworth about how the migrants are all coughing. \"Really sick,\" a voice says. In the 41-minute video, Farnsworth comments on the migrants\\' health several times, as though they constitute an infectious mass. In the background, at one point, you can hear a man broadcasting a separate livestream: \"How do you define an invasion?\" he asks. \"How many people have to come through the border?\"\\n\\nThe video streaming from Sunland Park on April 16 didn\\'t just draw attention to the arrival of migrants; it also drew attention to the presence of armed civilian militias at the border, trying to detain those migrants. The ACLU in New Mexico wrote a letter to the governor and the state attorney general describing the group\\'s actions as kidnapping. The United Constitutional Patriots\\' GoFundMe page was shut down, and the group was notified that it would be evicted from its camp. One member, Larry Mitchell Hopkins, was arrested by the F.B.I. on an outstanding weapons charge, while another, identified only as Viper, got emotional for The El Paso Times: \"\\u2009\\'I gave everything to my country and this is how they repay me,\\' he said as his eyes welled with tears.\" It\\'s very likely none of this would have happened if not for the livestreams. \"We have not had any complaints whatsoever,\" the police chief in Sunland Park said of the militia -- until the videos circulated.\\n\\nThe goal of these videos, obviously, is to maximize a sense of threat -- to broadcast to the nation that, in Farnsworth\\'s words, \"Yes, it is real; yes, it is happening; yes, it is in our backyard.\" She presents herself as an intrepid reporter working under cover of night, revealing a hard truth that the rest of the country denies or refuses to reckon with. In this sense, she\\'s working in a classic genre, one that spans from conspiracy theorists breathlessly dissecting evidence to documentarians playing ominous music over hidden-camera footage to the continuous coverage, in conservative media, of a migrant \"caravan\" moving through Mexico last fall. The tone is something like the moment in a thriller when evidence of a plot is uncovered; the videos manufacture an emotional reaction and then call that reaction the revelation of a shocking truth.\\n\\nFarnsworth\\'s overblown language -- the references to invasion, the invocation of disease, the mood of threat -- prods Americans toward identifying a problem and embracing a solution. \"Sorry if I\\'m a little shaky, guys,\" she says, referring to her camera work. \"This one got me kinda riled up.\" At more than one point, though, her video seems specially addressed to an audience of one: \"Share this to the president, share it to the White House, share it to anybody that you can.\"\\n\\n[Read about the long history of border militias.]\\n\\nAs the video comes to a close, she stands on a ridge, looking down on a file of migrants and monitoring them with her flashlight and camera. The expectation, obviously, is that Americans will join her in this perspective, surveying the scene and seeing a vexing problem -- if not a moral one, then at least a logistical one. Her video shows you hundreds of people, somewhere in the desert, and pushes you to ask: What do we do about this? For the militias, the first answer is to round up the migrants and force them to sit on the ground until actual authorities arrive. It\\'s almost as though the desert is a theater in the round and the migrants a crowd of silent theatergoers. The performance itself is dissonant; the militia members have to convey to viewers that they feel threatened and invaded, while at the same time showing their dominance. They have to telegraph that finding hundreds of displaced people in the darkness is no surprise to them, while at the same time marveling at its shocking importance. They have to convince the viewer that what\\'s happening is both quotidian and terrifying.\\n\\nThe risk of trying to create alarming videos isn\\'t just that the viewer might not share your alarm but also that you might call attention to the wrong things. At one point Farnsworth trains her camera on a woman in hot-pink pants, possibly pregnant, walking slightly apart from the others. She worries that the woman might try to escape and that she may not be pregnant but instead be carrying something in her hoodie. The more frightening woman, for many, will be Farnsworth; the urgent problem that announces itself will not be that migrants are crossing the border but that clutches of American extremists are confronting them with guns in hand. Instead of recoiling over the scale of migration, you might recoil instead from the types of control, intimidation and violence dedicated to preventing it and the conditions apparently condoned by authorities to facilitate that control -- just as the family-separation policy that had these people clutching children\\'s wrists made many Americans wonder about not the porousness of the border but what level of cruelty was an acceptable means of dissuading people from crossing it.\\n\\nThe fear and discomfort visible in these migrants -- a fear to which they\\'re clearly accustomed -- helps reveal how inauthentic the performance of fear in the militias is. Farnsworth\\'s alarm doesn\\'t feel believable, and that disbelief can be clarifying. No matter how astounded they purport to be about what they\\'ve discovered, it\\'s the people holding the guns who present the immediate danger. It feels wrong to say the migrants in this video pose a threat -- even a hypothetical one. Barely any of them look into the camera. Most are completely silent, as lunatics circle them, pointing flashlights into their eyes and screaming into cellphones.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'nausicaa_renner@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Nausicaa Renner', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/magazine/12mag-screenland/bacf115f25b4431b9636381461f72140-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'wgt': 112}\n",

Much like Biden supporters, the people who would be satisfied with Sanders as nominee are unique in that they are very cool on other Democrats. Let\\'s compare people who like Sanders as nominee with the general set of Democratic primary voters.

We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\\n\\nRead more about how we\\'re polling this here.\\n\\nWhat are Bernie Sanders\\' political positions? On healthcare: Sanders is leading the charge for universal healthcare, which has become popularly known as \"Medicare-for-all\" and is being embraced by most 2020 Democrats. He sponsored a bill pushing for this in 2017. Under Sanders\\' plan, every American would be provided with health insurance through Medicare and private insurers would be eliminated. \"The goal of health care must be to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way, not tens of billions in profits for the insurance companies and outrageous compensation packages for CEOs,\" Sanders said in a campaign speech in California in late March. On immigration: Sanders, who has referred to President Donald Trump\\'s immigration policies as \"heartless,\" wants to offer a pathway to citizenship to most undocumented immigrants and supports comprehensive immigration reform. One of Sanders\\' top 2020 staffers is an undocumented immigrant living in the US under protections via Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). His campaign has defended this choice against criticism from conservatives. Sanders has called for restructuring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), stating, \"We must not be about tearing small children away from their families.\" On climate change: Sanders is a co-sponsor of a resolution known as the \"Green New Deal,\" which is a plan to transition the US to 100% clean and renewable energy within the next decade. The Vermont senator has been vocal on environmental issues for decades and has criticized the media for not focusing enough on climate change. Sanders frequently rails against the fossil fuel industry and has vowed to stop allowing it to \"destroy our planet for profit\" if he wins the election. On campaign finance: Sanders has zeroed-in on campaign finance reform for years. Sanders gained popularity in 2016 by refusing corporate donations and looking to small donors to fund his presidential campaign. He\\'s continuing with this policy in 2020. He\\'s pushed for a constitutional amendment that would \"effectively prevent corporations from bankrolling election campaigns, and would give Congress and the states explicit authority to regulate campaign finances.\" Sanders has referred to Citizens United as \"one of the worst decisions ever brought about by the Supreme Court of this country.\" On abortion: Sanders has said \"abortion is health care\" and \"the decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman and her doctor to make, not the government.\" He believes abortion should be legal and in 2018 voted against a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks. \"We must stand up and fight any and all attempts to undercut Roe v. Wade,\" Sanders said in a November 2018 tweet. \"We must protect and expand a woman\\'s right to abortion and reproductive health care services.\" On LGBTQ rights: Sanders has long been a supporter of the LGBTQ community. In 1983, as mayor of Vermont, he signed a Gay Pride Day proclamation. He voted against Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell in 1993 and supported civil unions in Vermont in 2000. He was one of 67 members in the House to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. He spoke out in favor of gay marriage as early as 2009. Sanders opposes laws that prevent transgender people from using bathrooms of their choice, declaring that \"transgender discrimination has no place in the world.\" Sanders also opposes Trump\\'s ban on transgender people serving in the US military. On education: Sanders supports making public college and universities tuition-free for undergraduate students. Unders Sanders\\' College for All Act, the federal government would cover 67% of this cost, while the states would be responsible for the remaining 33% of the cost. Sanders has also pushed for drastically lowering student loan interest rates, stating it\\'s \"revolting\" the federal government makes \"billions in profits off of student loans each year.\" On Supreme Court and congressional issues: While other 2020 Democrats have expressed support for increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court, Sanders has not been particularly outspoken about this. Sanders biggest concern with the Supreme Court is appointing a justice who would support overturning Citizens United. Sanders has expressed reservations about eliminating the legislative filibuster, which other 2020 Democrats have said they\\'re open to discussion. \"I\\'m not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster,\" Sanders said in February. On guns: Sanders has called for banning assault weapons and supports universal background checks. Sanders has faced attacks from some Democrats in the past for not always supporting more restrictive gun control measures. He\\'s from a state with a large rural population and a fairly high percentage of gun owners. On criminal justice reform: Sanders has been outspoken on mass incarceration for many years, but did vote for a 1994 crime bill that many critics feel made the problem worse. Sanders has repeatedly said the US should invest more in jobs and education than incarcerating people. He\\'s called for an end to the war on drugs, and is in favor of legalizing marijuana at the federal level. The senator wants to end private prisons and cash bail. Sanders has described America\\'s criminal justice system as \"racist,\" stating that \"far too many of our black brothers and sisters end up dead at the hands of law enforcement.\" On trade: Sanders opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump withdrew the US from in 2017. Sanders has pushed for trade policy that \"is fair to American workers, not just large multi-national corporations.\" He routinely speaks out against the exploitation of low-wage workers in foreign countries, and the impact this has on the job market in the US. Sanders is against Trump\\'s tariffs against Canada and the European Union, but has expressed support for imposing \"stiff penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to prevent them from illegally dumping steel and aluminum into the US and throughout the world.\" Sanders has said Trump is right about the problem with trade with countries like China but has called for a more \"comprehensive approach.\" \"We need to fundamentally rethink our trade policies and move to fair trade rather than just unfettered free trade,\" Sanders said in March 2018. On foreign policy: Sanders voted against the 2003 Iraq War, which he often points to as a defining moment in his career. He\\'s generally against US intervention, and only supports war as a last resort. Sanders is strongly in favor of a foreign policy that involves working with the international community to solve global crises. He also wants to drastically cut US defense spending. He opposed Trump\\'s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. Sanders led the charge in the Senate for the US to end support the Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict. Sanders has been critical of Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians, but still supports the historic US-Israel partnership. Sanders has faced criticism for praising dictatorial socialist regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Soviet Union in the 1980s. More recently, he has caught flak for not being more forceful in condemning Venezuela\\'s Nicolas Maduro. Sanders opposes \"endless\" wars and wants to see conflicts like the Afghanistan War come to a conclusion. On taxes: Sanders is strongly in favor of taxing the wealthy to address inequality, calling on millionaires and billionaires to \"pay their fair share.\" He\\'s proposed a plan that would implement a 77 percent rate on billionaires\\' estates. Sanders would tax the estates of those who inherit more than $3.5 million, Sanders has railed against major companies like Amazon, Netflix, and GM paying \"nothing\" in federal income taxes. Sanders has also pledged to target offshore tax havens. What are Bernie Sanders\\' political successes? Sanders\\' key policy positions, once considered radical, were made mainstream via the popularity of his 2016 campaign. In 2016, the Democratic Party adopted the most progressive platform in its history. Today, many Democratic candidates are running on ideas popularized by Sanders. Sanders has helped energize young voters, gaining more of the youth vote in 2016 than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined. Sanders is the longest serving independent in the history of the US Congress, and the first Jewish politician to win a presidential nominating contest. How much money has Bernie Sanders raised? Just 10 hours after he announced, Sanders had already raised more than $4 million from nearly 150,000 individual donors. He raised $6 million in the 24 hours after joining the 2020 presidential race. Less than a week after announcing, Sanders is estimated to have collected $10 million from nearly 360,000 donors. The average donation has been around $27. Could Bernie Sanders beat President Trump?\\n\\nReferring back to INSIDER\\'s recurring poll, Bernie Sanders overall is believed to be a strong candidate in a general election against Donald Trump compared to your typical Democrat. For a typical candidate, the majority of respondents are undecided about how they think they\\'d perform, but not Sanders: 49% of people who say they\\'ll vote in the Democratic primary think he\\'d beat Trump, and 10% think he\\'d lose. That winning percentage is about 13 points higher than typical, which is rather good among the 2020 contenders.\\n\\nRead more of our best stories on Bernie Sanders: Bernie Sanders\\' 2020 campaign slogan is a direct rebuke of Trump\\'s 2016 message of \\'I alone can fix\\' America First-time voters for Bernie Sanders don\\'t care about his age, say he speaks to what matters to them and would\\'ve voted for him in 2016 Bernie Sanders draws in huge, young, diverse crowd for first 2020 rally on a snowy day in Brooklyn Here\\'s the difference between a \\'socialist\\' and a \\'Democratic socialist\\'', 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'john_haltiwanger@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'John Haltiwanger', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c9bf7dcffcb271daf672744-2732-1366.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1372549019607843, 'wgt': 109}\n",

He was to appear in court on Saturday for a hearing, but has not been identified because he has not been charged.\\n\\nThe apparent scale of the crime has shocked this country of just over a million people, where multiple killings are rare. The police chief, Zacharias Chrysostomou, told reporters last week, \"This is a form of crime unprecedented for the norms of Cyprus.\"\\n\\nHundreds of people held a vigil on Friday outside Cyprus\\' presidential palace to mourn the dead. The organizer used a bullhorn to read out the victims\\' names as well as those of other missing women, as others shouted, \"Where are they?\" Some participants held placards decrying \"sexist, misogynist and racist\" attitudes about women who work as housekeepers or in low-paying service jobs.\\n\\nThe discovery of a Filipino woman\\'s body in an abandoned mine shaft triggered the investigation that led to the captain\\'s arrest. The police identified her as Mary Rose Tiburcio, 38. Ms. Tiburcio and her 6-year-old daughter had been missing since May last year. Investigators say they believe that the missing 6-year-old was also killed.\\n\\nInvestigators zeroed in on the captain as a suspect and arrested him after scouring Ms. Tiburcio\\'s online messages. In court hearings, the police said the army officer was suspected of having approached women on an online dating site.\\n\\nCyprus has a sizable Filipino population. At the vigil, a group of tearful Filipino women held lighted candles and bowed their heads in prayer for the Filipino victims.\\n\\n\"I felt obliged to do something for these women, all the missing women, all the killed women,\" the protest organizer, Maria Mappouridou, said. \"I think deep down, all that we want, what everybody wants, is justice.\"\\n\\nEster Beatty, the chairwoman of the Federation of Filipino Organizations in Cyprus, said she hoped the event, and the tragedy of the deaths, raised public awareness about migrant workers. \"Right now, it\\'s really difficult for us to accept what has happened, what is going on,\" Ms. Beatty said. \"We still need a lot of answers.\"\\n\\nCampaigners say the police had ignored fears expressed for the safety of Ms. Tiburcio and her child when they went missing last year. One campaigner, Louis Koutroukides, said the police had questioned his motives and suggested that the missing woman and her child might have moved to the north of the divided island.\\n\\n\"If they believed me when I went to the police things would have turned out differently,\" he told state TV.\\n\\nWhile investigating Ms. Tiburcio\\'s death and searching for her daughter, the police found another body in the flooded mine shaft 20 miles west of the capital, Nicosia. The Cypriot news media have identified that victim as Arian Palanas Lozano, 28, also from the Philippines.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the suspect told the police about four more victims and gave them directions to a military firing range. The body of another woman, who according to the suspect was of Nepalese or Indian descent, was found buried there.\\n\\nThe suspect\\'s statements and other information have led the Cypriot police to believe that a 31-year-old Filipino woman who has been missing since December 2017, Maricar Valtez Arquiola, and a Romanian mother and daughter -- identified by news outlets as Livia Florentina Bunea, 36, and Elena Natalia Bunea, 8 -- are also among the victims in this case. They have been missing since September 2016.\\n\\nPresident Nicos Anastasiades said on Friday that he shared the public\\'s revulsion at \"murders that appear to have selectively targeted foreign women who are in our country to work.\"\\n\\n\"Such instincts are contrary to our culture\\'s traditions and values,\" Mr. Anastasiades added in a statement from China, where he was on an official visit.\\n\\nThe police in Cyprus have faced criticism from immigrant rights activists who said they did not act quickly enough to find the victims. The country has 80 unsolved missing-persons cases dating to 1990.\\n\\nA police spokesman, Andreas Angelides, on Friday defended the force\\'s tactics in dealing with missing-persons reports. He said investigations would have been more effective if lawmakers had taken the department\\'s recommendation to give law enforcement agencies the legal authority to gain access to a missing person\\'s personal data, phone records and emails.\\n\\nChief Chrysostomou said that a three-member panel had been assigned to review whether officers followed correct procedures in handling of recent killings.\\n\\nInvestigators have intensified the search for bodies of victims at the firing range, the reservoir and a man-made lake near the abandoned copper pyrite mine.

The seeding choices we make rank our naminees in the most ideal fashion we can envision. Were all of the higher seeds to conquer all of the lower seeds, it might be a boring tournament, but the result would validate our line of thinking and our carefully-constructed onomastic order.\\n\\nAs you\\'ve no doubt figured out by now, the actual Name of the Year voting rarely plays out the way we intend. Over the first few rounds, we learned which names we overseeded (hardly knew ye, Happy Kampire) and which ones deserved more love than we provided (sorry, Storm Duck fans.) If our voters pay any attention to our seedings, it doesn\\'t seem to much affect your personal preferences. And why should you? There is no reason to let the one-percenters of the Name of the Year community dictate your own opinions.\\n\\nNo name better exemplifies the annual upheaval of our rankings than Pope Thrower. His is a name meant for overthrowing the global establishment, and it would be a bitchin\\' metal band too: The heresy of God Dethroned meets the high fantasy of Bolt Thrower.\\n\\nIn our bracket, Pope Thrower is living his name\\'s proletariat dreams. After setting him as the 11-seed in the Sithole, we had low expectations. We thought the people, like us, would still be experiencing some Pope fatigue three years after both Pope McCorkle III and Taco Pope made the Final Four, with the former of the two papas coming away with the crown. But the people have had other ideas. Thrower has darted like a baseball pass into the Elite Eight, toppling higher seeds every step of the way, and he shows no signs of slowing down. Our gracious hosts seem to think he\\'s destined for a date in the finals, which would be quite the feat for someone we initially pegged as an underdog.\\n\\nBut there\\'s one part of Pope Thrower that doesn\\'t live up to the fight-the-power promise of his name. In his professional life, Thrower helps uphold one of the greatest symbols of American global hegemony. He is the press attaché for the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Vietnam, making him a mouthpiece for our affairs in a nation we\\'ve been neo-colonizing for more than 50 years. When an American citizen was detained for joining a protest in Ho Chi Minh City last June, Thrower was ready with the State Department\\'s statement. Two months later, when two U.S. nationals were detained in Hanoi in connection to a bomb plot, Thrower reiterated his government\\'s pledge to ensure \"the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad.\"\\n\\nFor Thrower, a State Department job is a way of embracing the new reality he sees in the world. \"Globalization is here, and it\\'s not turning back,\" he said during an address to students at his alma mater, Florida State University\\'s Panama City campus, back in 2016 \"There\\'s a good chance you will work with someone from another country.\" He sees American influence abroad as something to be celebrated, not overturned. \"We matter. America absolutely matters overseas,\" he said. \"Not just as a government or political force but what we stand for ... We have something special in America. Everyone wants to emulate it. That\\'s why you have people waiting 10, 15 years for immigration visas.\"\\n\\nThrower has certainly seen some of the world on his way to this year\\'s NOTY Elite Eight. His biggest upset so far saw him hurl Sithole three-seed Precious Orji, a Nigerian weightlifter, out of the tournament. Now he\\'s back in the U.S. of A to face author Alpha Omega Nickelberry III for a spot in the Final Four. Will the Pope Thrower revolution continue, or will Nickelberry take it home in honor of all the high seeds lost along the way?

I had invited him to see the performance, and now he was digesting it over a vodka martini.\\n\\nWhen a black screen at the Park Avenue Armory rose to reveal a stark glass box, a stripped-down version of Lehman\\'s emptied offices hours before the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Russo let out a gasp: \"Oh, my God.\"\\n\\n\"It was the feeling,\" he said later, explaining his visceral reaction to the scene. Mr. Russo said he had ended up quarterbacking that fateful Sunday board meeting at the suggestion of Lehman\\'s chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., \"because he, and pretty much everybody in the room, was in total disbelief.\"\\n\\nAs it turns out, the firm\\'s actual disbandment occupies just a few minutes of the script. The central story focuses on the original Lehman brothers -- three immigrants from Bavaria who came to this \"magical music box called America\" in the mid-19th century -- and their offspring.\\n\\nAfter opening a tiny fabric store in Montgomery, Ala., the men turned to brokering cotton between the slave-producing plantations in the South and industrial manufacturers in the North. After the Civil War, they expanded to other commodities before concentrating on financial services and later metamorphosing into the nation\\'s fourth-largest investment bank. Along the way the firm invested in tobacco and the Panama Canal, Hollywood\\'s original \"King Kong\" and Intel microprocessors.\\n\\nThe play follows the ferocious and glittering financial locomotive they rode through American capitalism for more than a century and a half before being roughly dumped off. But that momentous collapse serves as the story\\'s frame, bracketing its start and its finish.\\n\\nEchoes of 1929\\n\\nThe play\\'s narrative arc makes Lehman Brothers\\' hubristic fall seem inevitable. Mr. Russo, though, emphasizes that he always thought the investment firm\\'s bankruptcy was avoidable and that the Federal Reserve erred in not saving the bank.\\n\\nSo for him, a goose-bump moment came during a scene depicting a previous crisis, the 1929 crash, which Lehman Brothers managed to survive.\\n\\n\"The state will let the first banks fail, won\\'t lift a finger,\" Bobbie, a Lehman grandson, explains in the play, standing in the same glass cube of an office that serves as a stage for the 21st-century action. \"They need to look like they aren\\'t helping.\"\\n\\nHe continues: \"That\\'s why we shouldn\\'t help the other banks in crisis: If they ask for loans, we should say no. The state will do the same. After that first moment, the state will need strong banks and they\\'ll help us. If we can survive the first month, they won\\'t let us fail.\"\\n\\nAfterward, Mr. Russo talked about that calamitous 2008 weekend. \"It was exactly what happened in the play,\" he said. \"Everyone was more interested in protecting themselves than honoring commitments.\"\\n\\nWhen Fed officials asked the heads of competing major banks if they could survive a Lehman bankruptcy, they replied yes, Mr. Russo said. \"That probably had a significant impact on the decision to let Lehman go,\" he maintained. Soon, those institutions, which had similar problems, were receiving the same kind of government assistance denied to Lehman.\\n\\nThere were other echoes. Regulation and forced diversification would be the response to Wall Street\\'s excesses, Bobbie Lehman says. And \"the economy will stop growing, unemployment will rise and the whole system will go into paralysis.\"\\n\\n\"Bobbie\\'s talk was very much 2008 as it was 1929,\" Mr. Russo said.\\n\\nA Family Pilgrimage\\n\\nThe \"Trilogy\" will head to London\\'s West End after it finishes its four-week run on Saturday. This production, directed by Sam Mendes, was adapted from the original, which was written in Italian by Stefano Massini and ran five hours.\\n\\nPartly reflecting the high-altitude ticket prices ($425 for premium seats), New York audiences have included outsize numbers of financiers, as well as Lehman progeny who went to see the replay of a catastrophic downfall.\\n\\nWendy Lehman Lash, great-granddaughter of Mayer Lehman, the youngest of the three brothers, served as a conduit for tickets. \"I would say over 100 Lehman offspring have seen it,\" she said.\\n\\nMs. Lash\\'s paternal grandfather, Herbert Lehman, spent most of his career in politics, and served as New York\\'s governor and as a senator. Despite her Lehman roots, \"I didn\\'t know this story, how they reinvented themselves,\" Ms. Lash said of the founding patriarchs after seeing the play. \"How Lehman had to go from cotton to banking.\"\\n\\nJohn L. Loeb Jr., an 88-year-old family scion who researched the family history for a self-published memoir, has seen the show three times. \"It\\'s wonderful theater, but it\\'s largely the imagination of the author,\" Mr. Loeb said. \"It doesn\\'t quite tell the truth.\"\\n\\nEver since 2008, Mr. Loeb has chafed against the public\\'s equating the Lehman family itself with the financial crisis. Bobbie Lehman, who died in 1969, was the last family member to lead the firm. And as Mr. Loeb pointed out, American Express bought the company in 1984. A decade later, it spun off Lehman Brothers\\' financial service operations through a public stock offering, and Mr. Fuld became chairman and chief executive.\\n\\n\"I\\'m affected by the fact that our name is identified with one of the greatest crashes in history, and the Lehmans weren\\'t really like that,\" Mr. Loeb said. \"Mr. Fuld was a person I don\\'t think would have ever become a partner of the Lehman Brothers I knew.\" Mr. Fuld started as a summer intern at Lehman in 1966 and was named a partner in 1978.\\n\\n\\'Accurate, but It Is One Side\\'\\n\\nMr. Loeb\\'s comments reflect the hostile divide depicted in \"Trilogy\\'s\" third act between the bone-crunching aggressiveness of the traders who brought in unimagined earnings and the old-style bankers, with their \"velvet and cuff links,\" who loved the profits but disdained the ways it was acquired.\\n\\nFor Mr. Russo, the third act gave him an opportunity to contrast his own impressions of characters he knew, like Mr. Fuld, with their depiction onstage.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve spent more time with Dick probably than anybody else,\" said Mr. Russo, who for years had an office next door to Mr. Fuld\\'s, and recently had lunch with his friend. After the bankruptcy, Mr. Fuld, who presided over Lehman\\'s demise, was cast as an archvillain. In \"Trilogy,\" he is referred to by his nickname, the Gorilla, a man who \"carved his way through Wall Street,\" but Mr. Russo insisted, \"Basically he\\'s an extraordinarily moral person.\"\\n\\nMr. Russo also recalled Lewis Glucksman, a legendary trader who was later chief executive. Described in the play as a tough guy with a big belly who \"looks like he wants to kick the world\\'s ass with an ax,\" Mr. Glucksman was the person who hired Mr. Russo in the early 1990s.\\n\\n\"The side that is portrayed was accurate, but it is one side,\" Mr. Russo said of his former boss, who died in 2006. \"He was also very generous and giving.\"\\n\\nAfter \"Trilogy\" ended, Mr. Russo made his way down the audience bleachers. He especially appreciated the play\\'s recounting of the company\\'s sweeping legacy and its role in America\\'s transformation into an economic powerhouse.\\n\\nNow, what Lehman Brothers is best known for is its collapse.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'patricia_cohen@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Patricia Cohen', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/15/business/00lehman4/00lehman4-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4737016', 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'wgt': 94}\n",

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.\\n\\nGreg Ip, an economics columnist at The Wall Street Journal whom I admire, recently wrote a column lamenting the Democratic Party\\'s newfound hostility toward market economics.\\n\\n\"Where [Bill] Clin\\xadton once champi\\xadoned wel\\xadfare to work and an expanded earned-in\\xadcome tax credit to help the work\\xading poor, party activists want the fed\\xaderal government to guar\\xadan\\xadtee every\\xadone a job, a $15 min\\xadi\\xadmum wage and to tax com\\xadpa\\xadnies whose em\\xadployees earn so lit\\xadtle they need food stamps and Medicaid,\" Ip wrote. \"Where [Barack] Obama backed a cap on car\\xadbon-diox\\xadide emis\\xadsions and trad\\xadable per\\xadmits, party ac\\xadtivists want to force the coun\\xadtry off al\\xadmost all fos\\xadsil fu\\xadels in a decade via a Green New Deal.\"\\n\\nIp concluded: \"Yet be\\xadfore De\\xadmoc\\xadrats conclude mar\\xadkets are a fail\\xadure, they should rec\\xadog\\xadnize that mar\\xadket-based mech\\xada\\xadnisms have in many cases not even been given a chance.\"\\n\\nThe United States doesn\\'t have a meaningful cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, he pointed out. The private insurance markets in Obamacare have been undermined by President Trump and other Republicans. The Earned Income Tax Credit isn\\'t nearly as large as it could be.\\n\\nAll of this is true. But the main reason that Democrats -- including many centrist Democrats -- are moving away from market-based programs is not that they have had a change of heart. It\\'s that they are coming to terms with political reality.\\n\\nReality check\\n\\nThere are two big problems with market-based policies today.\\n\\nThe first is that most Republican politicians aren\\'t interested. They oppose almost any ambitious government policy, market-based or otherwise. Today\\'s Republican Party is adamantly opposed to fighting climate change, expanding health insurance or to reducing income inequality.\\n\\nAnd if Republicans are going to fight or undermine them, market-based programs probably aren\\'t going to happen. Such programs are often designed to be a compromise between the two parties -- policies that essentially use the market to correct a market failure. I realize that some people would argue that Democrats should still promote market-based programs even if Republicans won\\'t.\\n\\nBut that brings us to the second problem.\\n\\nThese programs tend to be more technocratic and complex than direct government programs. As a result, they also tend to be less popular with voters. Medicare is more popular than the Obamacare insurance exchanges. The basic idea of a Green New Deal -- subsidizing clean energy -- is more popular than a carbon tax. A higher minimum wage is more popular than an intricate series of tax credits for job retraining.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that Democrats would be foolish to push for complicated market-based policies when Republicans are hostile and voters are skeptical. Yes, these policies have the potential to be more efficient than direct government benefits (which is why policy wonks like me and Ip like them). Sometimes, though, market-based programs are more efficient only in a theoretical world where politics doesn\\'t intrude. To take Obamacare as an example, the direct expansion of government health insurance -- through Medicaid -- has worked better than the private markets.\\n\\nWhen there are government expansions that can strengthen the country, Democrats should pursue them, without apology. And when Republicans are again willing to consider market-based programs, Democrats should remain open to compromise.\\n\\nUntil then, the Democrats\\' newfound skepticism of market-based policies is the only rational response to a radicalized Republican Party.\\n\\nRelated: My recent Magazine piece delves further into this subject, with a focus on climate policy.\\n\\nThe Argument, live\\n\\nRoss Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and I had a great time taping our podcast, \"The Argument,\" before a live audience in New York last week.

They said they waited two days to cross the river, paying the equivalent of $5 each to cross over in a raft.\\n\\n\"We\\'re so relieved to be here,\" said Julie Guadelupe Duran, 25, explaining that she traveled on foot and by bus with her 2-year-old daughter Marjorie and her 11-year-old niece.\\n\\nDuran said she left her home in San Salvador on March 9 after she received numerous death threats from the Calle 18 gang, a rival of MS-13.\\n\\nDuran had gone to police to tell them that the father of one of the gang members sexually assaulted her niece, who lives with her. Gang members soon paid her family a visit, and \"said if we didn\\'t take back our testimony, they would kill us,\" Duran told The Post, adding that she hopes to join family members in Houston after she is processed by Border Patrol agents.\\n\\nEighty-three miles north, in Falfurrias, a city of just under 5,000 surrounded by a rugged terrain cut by brush and cactus dotted with blue barrels of water that local volunteers leave for migrants, Elias Pompa, 42, puts in 16-hour shifts patrolling an area of more than 1,000 square miles.\\n\\nHe is one of five deputies who goes on patrol alone.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t afford to have more than one deputy patrol at a time,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Brooks County Sheriff\\'s Deputy has been involved in 250 vehicle pursuits in his 10 years on the beat.\\n\\nHis fellow cops have christened him \"Chicken Hawk\" for his sharp-eyed observations that have led to seizures of drugs and migrants.\\n\\nHe watches for new footprints on the sandy terrain and ranch fences that are slightly bent where migrants and traffickers have crossed into the brush on the sprawling ranches that surround both sides of Highway 281.\\n\\nThe area, known as \"Death Valley,\" is the site where more than 600 migrants have been found dead in the past 10 years, their grisly remains picked up by the Brooks County Sheriff\\'s Office and sent to the medical examiner\\'s office in Hidalgo County.\\n\\n\"It\\'s always the little details that give them away,\" Pompa told The Post sipping on a large cardboard McDonald\\'s coffee cup.\\n\\nPompa once apprehended a work truck because he noticed there was no ladder on the back. There were 21 migrants stuffed into the back, and when the truck came to a screeching halt, the migrants scrambled in \"a bail-out.\"\\n\\nSome of them were only able to try to crawl away because their legs and feet were so numb from being cramped up in the truck, he said.\\n\\n\"I have a real curious mind,\" Pompa told The Post when asked how he is able to spot smugglers so well.\\n\\nFor example, he said he noticed that most traffickers modify the rear suspension of their vehicles so that they don\\'t sag under the weight of the many people they are cramming in.\\n\\nHe often seizes trucks that have no rear passenger seats, which allows them to accommodate dozens of migrants lying on top of each other. He once captured a Dodge Neon with only the driver\\'s seat intact and several migrants crammed in the back.\\n\\n\"They keep doing this over and over again,\" he said of the drugs and human smugglers who modify cars and trucks in order to spirit drugs and people across the Texas frontier.\\n\\nAmong the trucks he has seized at the Brooks County Sheriff\\'s evidence lot are brand-new pick-up trucks that retail for more than $70,000.\\n\\n\"It shows you how much money these traffickers have when they can afford to lose one of these trucks,\" Pompa said.\\n\\nAnother time, he noticed a pick-up truck with a young couple in the front. It was the middle of winter, but the windows were open. When he pulled them over, several migrants ran out, and he later found a wig in the passenger seat, indicating that one of the migrants was posing as a woman.\\n\\nIn another chase in 2016, it was the rear windshield wipers that gave the bad guys away. There was no rain, yet the distracted driver of the pick-up he was monitoring had the wipers on. When he stopped them, 12 migrants bailed out.\\n\\nThree years earlier, in 2013, a Suburban smuggling migrants crashed through a house, killing an elderly woman who was asleep in her bed.\\n\\nIn 2015, the driver of a Chevy Trailblazer hit a tree at 90 mph, killing the seven of nine migrants who were in his vehicle. The 19-year-old driver, who survived the crash, was illegal, said Pompa, who often finds pocket Bibles in Spanish in the trucks along with 10-pound bundles of marijuana and knives that migrants carry with them. He once found a pile of women\\'s underwear in one truck, he said.\\n\\n\"We have generations of smugglers here,\" he said, surveying the scrub. \"We deal with their criminal mischief everyday, and we need help.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nypost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'New York Post'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'isabel_vincent@nypost.com', 'name': 'Isabel Vincent', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/life-at-ground-zero-of-us-border-crisis-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 90}\n",

Some filmgoers prefer the classic 1941 version, also from Disney. Yet indisputably, the story for both originated in a book published in 1939 by Helen Aberson (1907-1999), a Syracuse-born writer of Ukrainian Jewish origin.\\n\\nAfter paying a mere 1000 dollars as flat fee for all rights, Disney has since reaped untold profits, which in merchandising alone must add up to hundreds of millions of dollars. All Disney theme parks, including Shanghai Disneyland, boast a Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride and sell Dumbo chotchkes.\\n\\nHelen Aberson, a cigar maker\\'s daughter, never imagined such rewards. She just enjoyed penning children\\'s stories inspired by her life and family, the rest of which remain unpublished. One was \"Sim, the Seal,\" named after her brother Sim, a Syracuse druggist.\\n\\nAberson\\'s original story explored emotions linked to be being physically different from others. Her tale of exceptionalism was well timed for the era of Fascist takeover in Europe, which was accompanied by lethal caricatures of Jews. Links between Jews and elephants, while not explicit in Aberson\\'s text, were also part of the times. Harley Erdman\\'s \"Staging the Jew\" cites the Jewish actor David Warfield (born Wohlfelt) who said that when he was asked to play a Jewish role, he added so much putty to his face that onstage, his \"nose began to elongate, until it was like the trunk of a baby elephant -- lengthy beyond my wildest dreams of what a Jew\\'s nose should be.\"\\n\\nIn those days, Jews were mocked even by other Jews, if their noses were too prominent. Cécile Kahn Brunschvicg, the wife of the French philosopher Léon Brunschvicg, was known as \"la trompe\" (elephant\\'s trunk) because of her proboscis, as her friend the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs admitted. Jews were even linked to elephants in literature. One year before Aberson\\'s book appeared, \"The Duchess and the Jeweller,\" (1938) a story by Virginia Woolf, offered this description of a jeweler:\\n\\n\"His nose, which was long and flexible, like an elephant\\'s trunk, seemed to say by its curious quiver at the nostrils (but it seemed as if the whole nose quivered, not only the nostrils) that he was not satisfied yet; still smelt something under the ground a little further off.\"\\n\\nThe Disney studio could also be overly conscious of Jewish noses, according to the American Jewish animator David Hilberman, who worked there. The biographer Neal Gabler quotes Hilberman that Zach Schwartz, a fellow Disney animator, was fired at a time when employees attempted to unionize: \"[Schwartz] wasn\\'t a troublemaker, he was a good artist and didn\\'t give anybody a hard time. What he did was have was the last name of Schwartz and a big nose.\"\\n\\nHelen Aberson had no clue about this seething nasal-related atmosphere when she was told that Disney wanted to buy the rights for her book. \"Dumbo\" was first brought to Disney\\'s attention by Herman \"Kay\" Kamen (born Kominetzky, of Russian Jewish origin), a marketing whiz. By the early 1930s, Kamen\\'s merchandizing efforts led to Mickey Mouse sweatshirts, underwear, and watches outgrossing the studio\\'s films. Kamen also pooh-poohed those who claimed to see occasional anti-Semitism in Disney\\'s films and business practices, asserting that Disney\\'s New York office had \"more Jews than the Book of Leviticus.\"\\n\\nOn the artistic side, echoes in \"Dumbo\" of Hans Christian Andersen\\'s Ugly Duckling and Munro Leaf\\'s \"Story of Ferdinand\" (1936) about a peace-loving bull, charmed the animators. They were led by Otto Englander, a Sephardic Jew born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who served as story director on \"Dumbo.\" Englander \"responded to it personally and was eager to go, for the creative opportunity that it afforded,\" as Didier Ghez\\'s \"Walt\\'s People\" points out. An Eastern European Jewish immigrant, Englander may have shared some of the vulnerabilities in Aberson\\'s character of the little elephant, so unlike those around him.\\n\\nIn an early draft of the film supervised by Englander, Dumbo is psychologically scarred by his difference. The elephant is taken to see Dr. I. Hoot, an owl psychiatrist, depicted in Robert Feild\\'s \"Art of Walt Disney\" (1942) In a later draft, this doctor was renamed Professor Hoot Owl, a psychiatrist and notary public whose advice was limited to: \"If you want to fly, go ahead and fly! Ten dollars, please.\" The Freudian satire here may have been considered a bit much for Disney audiences, as it was dropped from the final film.\\n\\nThe psychiatrist was the studio\\'s initial replacement for Aberson\\'s original concept, in which a robin named Red takes Dumbo to see Wise One, an owl, to find out the possibility of his escaping the circus. The owl, in the role of a counseling rabbi or chochem, tells the pachyderm that his ears might function as wings.\\n\\nThese and other changes expanded a humble tale originally published in a novelty format, in which readers scrolled past framed images to experience the narrative. Aberson was unsettled by a trip to Hollywood to meet and offer advice to Disney. She was little heeded. Aberson\\'s West Coast experience was the opposite of that of the Australian-born P. L. Travers, who two decades later would tyrannize Disney when he sought the rights to her Mary Poppins stories, as recounted in the film \"Saving Mr. Banks\" (2013)\\n\\nAberson lacked the natural assertiveness of Travers, and was incapable of bullying Disney, even had that approach been effective, which is doubtful. At an earlier, less prosperous era for Disney, with his studio traumatized by an worker\\'s strike which interrupted production on \"Dumbo,\" Uncle Walt would scarcely have reacted well to a forceful chaleria, even had Aberson resembled one.\\n\\nAs it was, she returned to the East Coast so deeply depressed by her experiences with Disney that she preferred to avoid focusing on it for the rest of her life. What turned her off so decisively, beyond seeing her work altered? Did she possibly meet Ben Sharpsteen, the supervising director of \"Dumbo?\" Neal Gabler writes:\\n\\n\"An animator named Art Davis, who had interviewed at the studio but was not hired, said that Sharpsteen, despite having a name that might be mistaken for Jewish, was actually a vicious anti-Semite who did not knowingly hire Jews and who reviled the ones who had been hired, which was how the studio got its reputation for hostility towards Jews.\"\\n\\nHad a brush with Sharpsteen upset Aberson? For whatever reason, she considered Disney\\'s omission of her name from future reprints of the \"Dumbo\" book as a personal failure. She was so discouraged that she did not even bother to renew her copyright on the original book in 1968, when it expired. As a result, she and her family never had legal basis for any claim against Disney. And expecting a voluntary expression of gratitude to a creative individual who invented a story that charmed generations would be too much to expect from the all-powerful Disney Company, then as now. So Disney obliterated the Jewish author of \"Dumbo,\" turning her into an anonymous contributor to The Mouse Factory.\\n\\nBenjamin Ivry is a frequent contributor to the Forward.\\n\\nThis story \"The Secret Jewish History Of \\'Dumbo\\'\" was written by Benjamin Ivry.', 'source': {'uri': 'forward.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Forward'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'benjamin_ivry@forward.com', 'name': 'Benjamin Ivry', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://images.forwardcdn.com/image/1090x480/right/top/images/cropped/gettyimages-1137433212-1554389052.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4701932', 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 81}\n",

It wasn\\'t even the first rock-and-roll hit. But 65 years ago this May, Bill Haley and His Comets\\' version of \"Rock Around the Clock\" was released, beginning its long, strange journey to the top of the pop charts, where it became the first rock-and-roll tune to hit the No. 1 spot on Billboard\\'s Hot 100 on its way to becoming the first global rock hit, and the single biggest selling rock-and-roll record of all time. And every step of the way, from the song\\'s creation to its recording to its dissemination and popularization, Jews contributed to the making of this signature song of the rock-and-roll revolution.\\n\\nAlthough its exact origins are clouded, and to this day the subject of dispute, \"Rock Around the Clock\" was credited to two Philadelphia-born Jewish songwriters, each the son of immigrants. The song was probably written in 1952 by Max C. Freedman, with some input by a music publisher named James Myers who went by \"Jimmy DeKnight\" for songwriting purposes. Like other music publishers at the time, Myers may have demanded a co-writing credit from Freedman in exchange for publishing and copyrighting the tune, although in later years, Myers claimed the bulk of the creative credit for himself, assigning to Freedman a few mere finishing touches on the tune. That seems unlikely, given that Freedman was already a well-established Tin Pan Alley songwriter, known especially for writing country-flavored tunes for the likes of Gene Autry, Bing Crosby, Bob Wills and Willie Nelson.\\n\\nFreedman wrote \"Rock Around the Clock\" with a regional country and Western bandleader in mind. A Michigan native, Bill Haley had enjoyed some success as a performing artist, especially around Philadelphia, and he was also a musical director at a radio station outside Philly. Haley was beginning to combine his honkytonk sounds with rhythm and blues; in 1951 he recorded a version of Ike Turner\\'s \"Rocket 88,\" which some consider to be the first rock-and-roll record. \"Rock Around the Clock\" was written to order by Freedman in the same manner for Haley, who began performing the song live in 1953.\\n\\nAt the time, Haley recorded for the Philadelphia label Essex Records, owned by Dave Miller, son of Jewish immigrants Albert and Olive Miller. For some reason, Miller didn\\'t want Haley to record \"Rock Around the Clock.\" Some say it was because there was bad blood between Myers and Miller. In the meantime, the tune was first recorded by a novelty outfit called Sonny Dae and His Knights in late 1953 and released in March 1954. Their version fell flat.\\n\\nMyers then sought to get Haley signed to a different record label, one that would record him doing the song. When Myers played some of Haley\\'s early recordings for Milt Gabler, who worked at Decca Records in New York City, the timing was perfect. Decca had just lost one of its star performers, Louis Jordan. Haley\\'s style was much in the same vein as Jordan\\'s \"jump blues,\" so Gabler signed him as a replacement. Gabler, born to Jewish immigrant parents in New York City in 1911, had first founded the label Commodore Records, which was devoted to recording such black jazz artists as Lester Young, Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday. It was Gabler\\'s Commodore that recorded Holiday\\'s \"Strange Fruit\" -- written by the Bronx-born Abel Meeropol, son of Russian Jewish immigrants -- when her regular label, Columbia Records, refused to touch it.\\n\\nLittle did he know what he was getting. At the first New York City recording session, in March 1954, Gabler reluctantly allowed Bill Haley and His Comets to track \"Rock Around the Clock,\" but only after the group had spent hours working on his preferred number, the Louis Jordan-styled \"Thirteen Women (& Only One Man in Town).\" When the first single came out in May, \"Rock Around the Clock\" was the B-side. Nevertheless, \"Thirteen Women\" garnered enough airplay and sales to give the song on the obverse side a leg up.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hollywood screenwriter and director Richard Brooks -- born Reuben Sax to Hyman and Esther Sax, Russian Jewish immigrants, in 1912 -- was hard at work adapting a novel about inner-city juvenile delinquency, called \"Blackboard Jungle,\" that he would direct for the silver screen. Brooks\\'s film starred Glenn Ford and featured early roles for young actors, including Vic Morrow, Jamie Farr, Paul Mazursky and a young black actor named Sidney Poitier. Brooks went searching for a song to play over the film\\'s opening and closing credits; Ford found the recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" in his teenage son\\'s stack of 45s and gave it to Brooks, and the rest is rock-and-roll history.\\n\\nThe film itself was critically lauded although somewhat controversial in its portrayal of teenage rebellion and violence. That, combined with the shocking sounds of rock and roll -- never before used in this manner in a Hollywood movie -- was like the shot heard round the world launching the revolution of teenage culture. It also may have helped to tarnish the reputation of the music itself from the get-go by associating it with violence; in some theaters, the soundtrack remained muted while the opening song played. But there was no stopping the song.\\n\\nIn May 1955, TV host Milton Berle -- born Mendel Berlinger in New York City -- made the brave step of bringing Bill Haley & His Comets to perform on his nationally aired Texaco Star Theatre television variety show, where he accurately predicted that the song would go all the way to No. 1. Television variety show host Ed Sullivan followed a few months later, making the Comets the first rock-and-roll outfit to appear on that show, which would later air controversial, beloved and career-making performances by Elvis Presley and the Beatles. \"Rock Around the Clock\" climbed the hit parade in the United States all the way to the top, where it remained for an unprecedented eight weeks, inspiring an entire generation of fans and would-be musicians around the world -- including a couple of lads from Liverpool named John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who would put together their own rock-and-roll combo just a few years later. The floodgates were open, and within a year, rock-and-roll artists like Presley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Buddy Holly would dominate the airwaves and record sales. Tin Pan Alley was dead. Long live rock and roll.\\n\\nSeth Rogovoy is a contributing editor at the Forward. He frequently mines popular culture for its less-known Jewish connections.

I could go on and on. The show is a veritable love song to the American melting pot.\\n\\nI know.

And if you don\\'t, Google \"things to hate about Guy Fieri,\" and you\\'ll come up with a whole slew of articles.\\n\\nSo maybe call me an outlier, but I love Guy Fieri. More specifically, I love Triple D. I love the fact that Fieri doesn\\'t really visit diners, drive-ins or dives anymore, but instead he roams America\\'s big cities, small towns, and strip malls, looking for the local curry joints, taco houses and noodle palaces. These are generally family-owned, populist restaurants where the \"real folks\" eat and the chef isn\\'t just going through the motions, but is actually adding an innovative touch to his or her menu.\\n\\nFieri\\'s favorite spots are the kind of places that aren\\'t seen all that often on the Food Network, on other TV channels or in America\\'s food magazines, which are all too often geared towards haute cuisine and celebrity chefs making frou-frou dishes that look like they should be in an art museum.\\n\\nI also love Fieri\\'s enthusiasm -- faked or not -- for the food he sees being made. I love that he talks to patrons, the average Joes from Spokane or Gulfport, who are obviously enjoying their tlayudas, lamb vindaloos or bánh mìs, and are just glad to have a place that is not a hoity-toity, upscale snobbery or a chain restaurant serving the usual burger/ribs/fried chicken fare.\\n\\nThe fact is, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives is actually a show about two things that have truly made America great: individual entrepreneurship and immigration. The people Fieri features have come to these shores from other countries and have totally enriched our lives. Not that Donald Trump, who thinks a taco bowl is authentic Mexican cuisine, would understand this.

Each of us brought pieces of the puzzle to the table, and one stood out: Tower 27/222, a 99-year-old transmission tower suspected of causing the 2018 Camp Fire, the worst wildfire in California history. A source pointed us to one document in particular, a form filed with federal regulators in which PG&E noted that the \"useful life\" of such towers expired at 75 years.\\n\\nThe utility kept Tower 27/222 in operation despite warnings about aging equipment along the line where it stood, storms that knocked down five deteriorating PG&E structures in the area, and the threat posed by powerful winds akin to the Santa Anas of Southern California.\\n\\nWe conducted dozens of interviews and pored over thousands of pages of documents and court depositions taken from PG&E employees who recounted how supervisors ignored concerns and warnings about vulnerabilities of the system and its equipment.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t a one-of-a-kind incident with PG&E. And it wasn\\'t just one side of the company.\\n\\nExplosions in PG&E\\'s gas pipeline system have also been deadly, and practices in that part of its business resulted in a felony conviction.\\n\\nBut wildfires associated with the company have been especially devastating, including the Camp Fire, which killed 85 people. Among them was Andrew Downer, an amputee who died on his porch with his service dog when no one could reach him. \"There are days it\\'s very hard to get up in the morning,\" his partner, Iris Natividad, told us.\\n\\nOver and over, the reporting showed that practices at PG&E were driven by the company\\'s focus on its bottom line.

The Green New Deal is national; congestion pricing is New York-specific. One is expansive, a solar- and wind-energy-based revitalization of our society and economy. The other seems punitive, making drivers pay for what is now free.2\\n\\nBut we believe the two have a great deal in common, both practically and philosophically. So we invite Green New Deal adherents -- from Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to the legions of determined climate-justice activists who have put the Green New Deal on the political map -- to make congestion pricing in New York a stepping stone in the national fight. The New York legislature must pass a state budget by March 31; at issue is whether that budget will include the initial appropriations needed to put congestion pricing into practice.3\\n\\nThe first commonality between the Green New Deal and congestion pricing is the fact that any program to save the earth's climate depends on having cities thrive. Urban residents use only a fraction as much fossil fuel as suburbanites or rural dwellers, not because they are virtuous but because cities, due to their compactness, are inherently lower-carbon. City residents drive less both because they can take public transit and because destinations are close by. Density also enables homes and offices to use less power and heat. For cities to thrive and grow, automobile traffic must be tamed and restrained, which congestion pricing does with marvelous efficiency.4\\n\\nCongestion pricing shares DNA with the 20th-century New Deal through emphasis on public investment. Federal spending in the 1930s strung electric wire and conserved the soil, and federally driven investment going forward can decarbonize our economy. In the same way, the congestion-toll revenues in New York can pay to modernize the city's buses and subways -- as happened after London adopted congestion pricing in 2003. Thanks to massive transit investment and reappropriation of street space there, nearly 25 percent more people now enter the center of London daily, mostly on trains, buses, and bikes, while car-travel speeds have remained stable.5\\n\\nThere's more. Congestion pricing rests upon the Rooseveltian idea of caring for the commons -- rivers and forests and farmland. Streets and transit are cities' commons, which America has allowed cars to plunder for a century.6\\n\\nAfter years of temporizing, transit advocates in New York have finally resolved that the antidote to broken subways and too many automobiles must include charging vehicles to drive in city centers. Both of the city's leading mass-transit coalitions -- the more business-oriented Fix Our Transit and the Fix the Subways coalition, led by the grassroots group Riders Alliance -- have put congestion pricing at the top of their agendas. Before long, we predict, Green New Deal supporters will similarly acknowledge that fully unleashing green energy requires a robust carbon tax, not just as a source of funds but to reset societal defaults, reorient incentives, and unlock innovation.7\\n\\nThe Markey-Ocasio-Cortez Green New Deal resolution is adamant about labor rights and economic justice. So too is the movement for congestion pricing. New York City's most venerable anti-poverty advocate, the Community Service Society, examined congestion pricing and found that for each low-wage New Yorker who regularly drives into Manhattan, nearly 40 will benefit from better trains and buses paid for with the congestion-toll revenues. In the same vein, the right-of-center Manhattan Institute concluded last year that extending New York's decade-long jobs boom depends on massive and effective investment in mass transit to allow immigrant and other workers to access jobs.8\\n\\nThese considerations appear to have finally pushed New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio off the political fence last month to proclaim his support for congestion pricing.9\\n\\nThe iconic New York progressive centrist Daniel Patrick Moynihan understood this 30 years ago. As a powerful Senate Committee chairman, he found a way to use a portion of federal-gas taxes to decouple urban mobility from automobiles, spurring a rise in transit and bicycling and making cities cleaner and more dynamic.10\\n\\nThere is this difference, however. Unlike the Green New Deal, which is open-sourced by design, congestion pricing for New York is being finalized by the state's governor, who seems intent on keeping the toll levels and other key plan details under wraps till the last minute. Attempts to toll the entrances to Manhattan's central core have come up short so many times that leaders have come to presume that ironfisted control is the only way to get it done. But that approach is out of step with both the current political era and the enormous momentum to pass congestion pricing in the state budget this month and finally cure the dysfunction of the city's streets and subways that afflicts millions daily.11\\n\\nA fifth of the way into our new century, awareness is spreading of the folly of giving away a finite resource for free, whether it's the atmosphere's capacity to remain temperate or Broadway's five travel lanes through Times Square.12\\n\\nA Green New Deal, like its illustrious antecedent, can start in New York. Today, congestion pricing can revitalize and unsnarl New York's subways and streets. Tomorrow, a nationwide mobilization can turn our carbon economy green.13\", 'source': {'uri': 'thenation.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Nation'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jeff_blum@thenation.com', 'name': 'Jeff Blum', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'charles_komanoff@thenation.com', 'name': 'Charles Komanoff', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/congested-nyc-ap-img.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4669530', 'sentiment': 0.0980392156862746, 'wgt': 78}\n",

Here\\'s what it\\'s like inside the $25 billion neighborhood.\\n\\nFor years, the public has been made aware that at least $1.2 billion in funding for the development hails from an immigrant investor program called EB-5, which gives visas to foreign investors who put as much as $1 million into a business that employs American workers.\\n\\nThe threshold can be reduced to $500,000 for investors who place their capital in a \"targeted employment area\" (TEA) -- either a rural community or distressed urban area with a high unemployment rate (at least 150% of the national average).\\n\\nThe boundaries for TEAs are determined by the state and can be molded to include as many census tracts as the government wants, as long as they share a border. The practice has been equated to gerrymandering, but, without it, Hudson Yards could not be considered a distressed urban area.\\n\\nAs a community bordered by expensive neighborhoods like Chelsea and Hell\\'s Kitchen, Hudson Yards was too wealthy on its own to qualify for the EB-5 program. To solve the problem, the state included a few census tracts from Harlem as part of the overarching TEA.\\n\\nSuddenly, the development was eligible for hundreds of millions in funds, which it reportedly used on a few projects: an infrastructure platform, office tower, and a retail hub.\\n\\n\"By utilizing the EB-5 program we were able to finance the critical infrastructure for the project, the platform, where traditional financing is all but non-existent,\" a spokesperson for Hudson Yards told Business Insider. \"This capital, which comes at no cost to the American taxpayers, was the catalyst for the Hudson Yards project.\"\\n\\nBut it was also money that might otherwise have gone to struggling areas.\\n\\nAn NYU paper tracking the EB-5 program found that Hudson Yards\\' developer, Related Companies, was set to raise capital from 3,200 immigrant investors as of 2017.

Alkhameri, a leader in the Yemeni immigrant community, said refugees from Yemen arriving in the U.S. found driving for Lyft or Uber was one of the only jobs they could get to survive and support their families and they initially felt boxed in. Now, he says, they\\'re finding its difficult for them to leave.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t care whether Lyft goes public, the main concern is about how much we drivers make,\" said driver Mostafa Maklad. \"To drive 80 hours a week, how many hours can you sleep everyday? Their model is that it\\'s a flexible job, but the fact is that we can\\'t work whenever we want. We work sometimes 12-16 hours a day, seven days a week -- that needs to be changed.\"\\n\\nDrivers have been attempting to directly engage with Lyft for over a year. In October, drivers delivered petitions to both Uber and Lyft asking for meetings with executives to discuss company policies like driver deactivation. A driver was tackled outside Uber headquarters trying to deliver the message, while Lyft received the petition and then held a meeting with drivers. Both sides described the meeting positively but no substantial changes seem to have occurred as a result.\\n\\nLyft had previously scheduled a second meeting with drivers and organizers for today, but the company promptly canceled the meeting when the protest against falling wages was announced.\\n\\n\"We want to show up to show this company is greedy,\" said Omar Alkhameri. \"They build the company on our jobs. We do everything for this company and they call us partners but we are not. We use our cars, we pay insurance, we do maintenance, the company is growing because of us and we get no benefits.\"\\n\\nDespite no shortage of worker grievances and energy, organizing gig workers is uniquely challenging. There is no central workplace either in the form of an office or online. Gig companies typically don\\'t connect their gig workers in the way they connect their technical and business operations, a symptom of the two-tier system emblematic of the gig economy. In one company, an engineer and a driver have completely different day-to-day experiences -- as well as salaries that may as well exist in alternate universes.\\n\\nLyft lost $911 million last year, an even bigger reported loss than its $688 million loss in 2017.

But it\\'s all hub.\\n\\nOver the weekend, former White House counsel Don McGahn\\'s off-the-record musings about how President Donald Trump runs his show surfaced thanks to reporting from Jonathan Swan at Axios.\\n\\nMcGahn was partaking in what\\'s become a ritual for certain ex-West Wingers; let\\'s call it the \"it-was-sometimes-really-horrible-working-in-the-Trump-White-House-but-I-decided-to-continue-debasing-myself-anyway-because-there-were-things-I-wanted-that-made-it-worth-selling-my-soul\" sacrament. He reportedly told a gathering of Senate aides that he\\'d \"spent the last couple of years getting yelled at\" by the president. McGahn largely praised Trump, but he also \"hinted at the brutality of his tenure.\"\\n\\nAmong other things, McGahn reportedly outlined Trump\\'s management style. He was described as saying that \"Trump doesn\\'t trust one person as a gatekeeper\" and \"dislikes intermediaries.\" McGahn went so far as to describe this as a reflection of Trump\\'s \"hub and spokes model\" of management - a structure in which \"no member of staff is empowered because Trump is the hub and he makes the decisions; all the senior aides are spokes.\" Trump often assigns \"the same task to multiple people\" and \"there is no chief of staff in the usual sense.\"\\n\\nLest it\\'s lost on anyone by now, Donald Trump is not some Peter Drucker-style organisational guru. He doesn\\'t have a management \"theory\" at all, much less any coherent \"hub and spokes model\" deployed with purpose to achieve substantive policy goals. He\\'s a solo pilot and a force of nature who, prior to his presidency, ran a boutique business that specialized in branding and licensing his name, while developing a handful of golf courses and managing a lucrative real estate portfolio.\\n\\nTrump also was a serial bankruptcy artist who repeatedly drove the only organization of size he ever managed, his casino company, off a financial cliff. There were no hubs and spokes at the Trump Organization for most of its existence. There was just a hub. The White House is the same and anyone who wants to use consultant speak to parse Trumpian chaos, staff turnover and bumbling is (no doubt intentionally) kidding themselves.\\n\\nA hub and spokes model can work if all of the spokes are individuals authentically empowered by a confident, capable leader at the hub who recruits and retains talented, effective people. Together, they make the organizational wheel spin and everybody arrives at their destination together.\\n\\nThen there\\'s the Trump White House.\\n\\nOn Monday, Trump began decimating the Department of Homeland Security. The purge took place because the president\\'s foray into immigration reform has run off the rails very publicly, and he\\'s unwilling to take responsibility for a debacle that spiraled into a humanitarian crisis. Trump\\'s policy thus far has consisted of claiming he\\'s going to keep migrants and refugees out by building The Wall. For anything beyond that, he\\'s now deferring to two young insiders: Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner. In the meantime, Trump is trying to mask the magnitude of his failure by blaming other DHS managers and forcing them to walk the plank.\\n\\nIt began with the defenestration of Kirstjen Nielsen, who was booted out on Sunday evening after helping Trump pursue The Wall, deploy National Guard forces to round up undocumented immigrants, and - in what\\'s certain to be a historical emblem of Trump\\'s rule - separate migrant children from their families. Nielsen also \"faced criticism from Trump over things she couldn\\'t control, such as court rulings against his plan to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program, his ban on refugees from predominantly Muslim nations, and a perceived inability to effectively secure or choke off border crossings,\" according to Bloomberg News reporters.\\n\\nNielsen was paranoid about getting sacked toward the end of her tenure and never found an easy bond with a president who rarely takes advice. After a little over a year on the job, she found herself attending at least one cabinet meeting in which Trump \"castigated her repeatedly\" in front of her peers, according to the New York Times. (Take note: Breaking a spoke in half, publicly, does not comport with an effective hub and spoke strategy.)\\n\\nNielsen also had to navigate Oval Office meetings in which Trump suggested that the best approach would be to shut down the border entirely or to illegally deny entry to asylum seekers. Nielsen reportedly waved Trump off of that latter move, although CNN reported on Monday that the president encouraged border agents to break the law and deny entry to migrants during a visit to the border last Friday. Nielsen will no longer get to contribute to such constructive hub and spoke sessions, but it\\'s hard to gin up much sympathy for her or any other ex-Trump crew mates feeling shell-shocked by their experiences. They\\'re all adults who decided to hitch their wagons to Trump\\'s star and to leave morality, civility or legality by the wayside.\\n\\nOther folks swept up in the DHS unraveling are also getting grade-school humiliations visited upon them. Ralph Alles, who oversaw the U.S. Secret Service (as well as security breaches at the president\\'s Mar-a-Lago club) was forced out on Monday and will probably be accompanied by at least four other senior DHS officials. According to the Times, Trump grew so frustrated with Alles that he made fun of his looks and called him \"Dumbo\" because of his large ears. (Again: Good hubs don\\'t run around bullying and demeaning the spokes.)\\n\\nAll of the fun and games isn\\'t unique to DHS. Trump\\'s gyrations caused James Mattis to flee the Defense Department in December and his full-fledged replacement has yet to be found. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Jonathan Bernstein noted, it\\'s \"now been more than a year since Trump had a full, confirmed cabinet, something he\\'s only had for about four and a half months of his presidency.\"\\n\\nSurvivors in the Trump shark tank are, inevitably, family members like Kushner or the president\\'s daughter, Ivanka - a reality that was set in stone from the very day of his inauguration. Other newbies to the White House who don\\'t enjoy a family tie seem to have realized that the best way of surviving as a spoke may be to telegraph your loyalty to the hub well in advance of getting the actual job. Attorney General William Barr, for example, shared a long memo pooh-poohing the Mueller investigation with the president long before Trump appointed him.\\n\\nThe cure for what ails Trump and his White House can be found in a book he wrote almost 20 years ago. But don\\'t expect him to follow his own advice. \"I put people together for their management skills, but I like to find good combinations as well. And when I feel that I have the right team, I let them show me what they can do,\" he wrote in \"The America We Deserve,\" one of his many non-fiction works of fiction. A secret part of that winning recipe, he added, \"was my willingness to step back, not to be too hands-on, and to let the talented people who work for me do their own thing.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'timothy_l_o_brien@bloomberg.com', 'name': \"Timothy L.

Since Ms. Horsten\\'s work as a journalist for German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur had brought them to New York in 2012, she and Mr. Zeltner, a freelance journalist and a founder of Work Awesome, a company that organizes conferences, trips and workshops, had both loved the long days they spent exploring far-flung corners of the city.\\n\\nMoving to a new neighborhood every month would be something of a logistical nightmare, especially with their toddler, Emma, in tow, but it might also transform an unavoidable hassle into an adventure.\\n\\n\"And then the weekly FaceTime call with our parents came up, and the responses were not so good. They hated the idea,\" Mr. Zeltner said.\\n\\n\"But all our New York friends loved it,\" Ms. Horsten said. And a friend\\'s generous offer of a free month in a Long Island City, Queens, loft building that he owned tipped the scales in favor of the experiment.\\n\\nThe family pared down their possessions to little more than a few large boxes and pieces of furniture -- which they would store at the Long Island City building for the year -- and took along one suitcase each and a milk crate of toys for Emma.\\n\\n\"My favorite day was when we got rid of all the stuff in our Park Slope apartment,\" Mr. Zeltner said. \"In Park Slope, there\\'s this culture of putting things out on the stoop. In one year, we\\'d ended up with so many things.\"\\n\\nMs. Horsten added: \"We put it all back out on our stoop, and it disappeared in minutes. It was so liberating.\"\\n\\nLong Island City charmed them, so much so that as the end of the month neared they wondered if maybe they shouldn\\'t just stay. \"Long Island City is such a strange place, but living there, this area of taxi depots and Chinese cake factories really came to life,\" Mr. Zeltner said. \"We discovered the village underneath it.\"\\n\\nBut the success of their first month pushed them to continue. \"Waking up someplace is so different from visiting,\" Ms. Horsten said. \"You get a much better feel for it.\"\\n\\nThey decided on a few terms: They would try to live in all five boroughs. And to get to know each new neighborhood, they would have a dinner party in their apartment, as they had in Long Island City, inviting local business owners, neighborhood activists, people mentioned in newspaper articles and any other likely candidates who crossed their paths.\\n\\n$3,900 | Upper West Side\\n\\nChristina Horsten, 36, and Felix Zeltner, 36\\n\\nOccupations: Ms. Horsten is a New York correspondent with a German news agency; Mr. Zeltner is a freelance journalist and a founder of Work Awesome.\\n\\nChildren: Emma, 4, and Lily, newborn\\n\\nRents during the project: On average, $2,800 a month -- including $2,700 in Harlem; around $4,000 in Chinatown and Dumbo, Brooklyn; a free month in Long Island City, Queens; and a free two-week sublet in Hell\\'s Kitchen.\\n\\nFavorite neighborhood: \"It\\'s really hard,\" Mr. Zeltner said. \"But the neighborhood that maybe stuck to our minds the most was St. George. You could see the ferry coming as you walked down the hill and estimate how much time it would take to get there.\"\\n\\nAt first, things went remarkably well.\\n\\nThey found their next apartment, a beautiful loft in Chinatown, on Listings Project, a free weekly email of real estate and related opportunities, serving artists and the creative community.\\n\\nThe loft \"was like something out of a movie,\" Mr. Zeltner said. And while the price was substantially over their $2,900-a-month budget, they figured they could even things out over the course of the year, paying less for subsequent apartments.\\n\\nBefriending a family in Chinatown, they also found a comparatively affordable preschool for Emma: a bilingual Mandarin-English center that she still attends.\\n\\nThe next months brought stops in Staten Island (a house in St. George, where they lived with the owner, an Antiguan immigrant who had gone to school across the street from the property as a child and vowed to buy it one day) and Harlem (a studio, where the idyllic summer days and their good luck so far lulled them into a sense of ease).\\n\\nAs September approached, their next sublet proved difficult to find. \"We started out in a time when people were leaving, so it was easy,\" Mr. Zeltner said. \"But work really picks up for New Yorkers in the fall.\"\\n\\nWhen their Harlem sublet ended, they bided their time by taking a road trip, then fell for a scam in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, when an apartment they found advertised online wasn\\'t actually available to rent. (They eventually got their move-in fee refunded through PayPal.)\\n\\n\"That was rock-bottom,\" Ms. Horsten said. \"Fortunately, we have good friends, and we crashed in Long Island City while we planned things out.\"\\n\\nRather than just responding to ads, they decided they to submit their own post to Listings Project, describing what they were doing. They also started a newsletter for friends and family. A flood of offers followed.\\n\\nOver the remainder of the year, they spent time in a townhouse in Mott Haven, in the Bronx, as well as apartments in Chelsea, the East Village, Hell\\'s Kitchen, and Williamsburg, Bushwick and Dumbo, in Brooklyn. They lived in an oceanfront home in Sea Gate, Brooklyn, and amid thousands of books in a garden-level apartment of an antique bookseller in the Sugar Hill neighborhood of Hamilton Heights.\\n\\n\"In the end, we were like, \\'Why should we even stop doing this?\\'\" Ms. Horsten said.\\n\\nBut then a lease takeover on Listings Project caught their attention: a two-bedroom, two-bathroom duplex on the top of an Upper West Side townhouse.\\n\\n\"It was more than we thought we could afford, and more than we\\'d ever paid,\" Ms. Horsten said -- $3,900 a month. \"But we saw the roof deck, and after all the crazy moving, we thought, \\'Let\\'s just enjoy this oasis for a while.\\'\"\\n\\nSince they moved in, a little over a year ago, they have written a book about their experience, Stadtnomaden, which will be published in Germany in April.\\n\\nA second daughter, Lily, was born in January. And with a newborn, they have no intention of moving again anytime soon. Still, many aspects of their adventure have remained with them.\\n\\n\"In the same way that we\\'ve tried to keep minimalism in our life, we try to stay in touch with all the people we\\'ve met,\" Ms. Horsten said.\\n\\n\"We realized it was a lifelong project to try to get to know New York City,\" Mr. Zeltner said.\\n\\nBut there is one member of the household agitating for a repeat: Emma.\\n\\n\"I think she loved it the most,\" Ms. Horsten said. \"At all the places we stayed, she found stuff I never noticed: children\\'s books, a dollhouse, a drum set. Even now, she\\'s like, \\'When are we moving to a new home?\\' And we\\'re like, \\'We kind of like it here.\\'\"\\n\\nFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Hong Kong', 'body': 'Two Bedrooms in the Heart of Hong Kong$5.3 MILLION (41.8 MILLION HONG KONG DOLLARS)\\n\\nThis two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom apartment is in the western section of Mid-Levels, an affluent residential area built into the northern slope of Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island, in Hong Kong.\\n\\nThe loft-like 1,215-square-foot unit is one of seven penthouses at Merry Court, a 20-story, two-tower high-rise constructed in 1970 with 139 units. Its alfresco rooftop terrace offers sweeping views of Central (Hong Kong\\'s business district), Victoria Harbour and the Kowloon Peninsula to the north.\\n\\nConcrete walls, exposed beams, tall windows, wood floors and an open layout give the home an industrial feel. A renovation three years ago eliminated the maid\\'s quarters and \"made it much more spacious,\" said Charis Chan, the head of international projects for List Sotheby\\'s International Realty, which has the listing.\\n\\nFrom the elevator landing, which is shared by four apartments, the front door opens between the kitchen-and-dining and living areas. Bar seating makes the kitchen an entertaining hub. The oversized, granite-topped island has a built-in five-hob cooktop and wok ring, with a rectangular fan hood above and storage below. The Siemens refrigerator and dishwasher have the same glossy white finish as the cabinets, and the wine fridge has a black surround. Close to the entry, floor-to-ceiling steel cabinets have a rusty finish. A powder room is across from the kitchen.\\n\\nThe lighting and speakers are controlled through a smart-home system. The furniture is not included in the price, but is available to buy, Ms. Chan said.\\n\\nBeyond the living and dining areas are two bedrooms. Each has an en suite bathroom with a patterned ceramic-tile floor and a granite-topped vanity. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet and room for a queen-size bed. Slightly smaller, the second bedroom has a built-in wardrobe.\\n\\nAn indoor staircase, open to the living area, leads to a 918-square-foot rooftop terrace, which has outdoor seating and dining spaces, as well as a kitchen and minibar. A sailcloth provides shade, and windscreens line the perimeter. A washer and dryer are also on the roof.\\n\\nThe apartment comes with a covered parking space on the ground floor of the podium-style building.\\n\\nThe Mid-Levels West area of Hong Kong is teeming with ultraluxury condos and tiny bachelor pads. This apartment is a 20-minute commute to the city\\'s business district via a chain of 20 covered outdoor escalators, the longest series in the world. Along the flow of moving stairs and inclined moving walkways are supermarkets, convenience stores, specialty shops, pubs, coffee shops, restaurants and wet markets selling fresh poultry, pork, and fish and reptiles. Mid-Levels West also has a number of international schools, among them the University of Hong Kong and King\\'s College. The apartment is about 35 minutes by car from Hong Kong International Airport.\\n\\nMarket Overview\\n\\nHong Kong has three main regions: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. Even with an 8 to 10 percent drop in prices and sales volume between last August and the end of 2018, the city remains -- for nine years running -- the world\\'s most expensive housing market.\\n\\nThe \"downhill ride\" was sparked by the trade war between the United States and China, said Koh Keng Shing, the founder and chief executive of Landscope Christie\\'s, in Hong Kong. Other factors included interest-rate hikes in the United States, the \"slowdown of China and Hong Kong\\'s economies, and uncertainties brought by Brexit,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the government\\'s Rating and Valuation Department, the drop halted a 28-month upward trend.\\n\\nHowever, Binoche Chan, the chief operating officer of List Sotheby\\'s International Realty, said she saw \"a strong rebound\" at the beginning of this year.\\n\\nSimon Smith, head of research and consultancy for Savills Hong Kong, agreed, attributing the \"1 to 2 percent\" pickup during the first quarter of 2019 to \"a recovering stock market, ending of the current interest-rate hike and possible resolution of the U.S.-China trade conflict.\"\\n\\nThe strongest areas of the market are the \"very tiny flats and the super-luxurious,\" Ms. Chan said, with prices reaching 130,000 Hong Kong dollars ($16,600) a square foot. Luxury buyers favor the Peak, South Side and Mid-Levels areas, with the \"new rich\" buying in the Kowloon Station district, she said.\\n\\nHousing is less expensive beyond Hong Kong Island. In the first quarter of 2019, prices in Kowloon were 6 percent lower, and in the New Territories, Hong Kong\\'s northernmost region, they were 25 percent lower, Mr. Smith said.\\n\\nTo help ease the housing crunch, 97,445 units are expected to be built during the next five years, Mr. Smith said. Because of the scarcity of land on Hong Kong Island, new inventory will be created by razing old buildings for redevelopment. In Central and Western Hong Kong Island, one to two new buildings are expected to be built every year, said James Fisher, director of market analysis and analytics for Spacious Hong Kong, a real estate platform. There is more expansion in the Eastern District of Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and in the New Territories.\\n\\nIn Mid-Levels, prices for a two-bedroom unit in an older building range from 18,000 to 20,000 Hong Kong dollars ($2,300 to $2,550) a square foot, Mr. Smith said, and new apartments generally sell for 35,000 to 40,000 Hong Kong dollars ($4,460 to $5,100) a square foot.\\n\\nWho Buys in Hong Kong\\n\\nBecause nonresident buyers have to pay a 30 percent stamp duty, the vast majority of buyers in Hong Kong are mainland Chinese and locals, Ms. Chan said. Foreigners tend to rent, Mr. Fisher said.\\n\\n\"It is not a low-income immigration,\" Mr. Fisher said, explaining that residents from mainland China have come to Hong Kong in the past 10 years for \"middle-class and executive jobs\" once held by British, American, Australian and European expatriates.\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t help that you had expats in Hong Kong costing so much more than other places in the world,\" he said. \"Companies thought about how they could localize more.\"\\n\\nBuying Basics\\n\\nThe 30 percent stamp duty paid by foreign buyers is double the 15 percent paid by local buyers, Mr. Smith said. Legal fees are normally less than 0.1 percent, Mr. Koh said.\\n\\nThe buyer and seller each pay about 1 percent of the sale price in commissions.\\n\\nMortgages require 40 to 50 percent down on a first property, and are \"a little harder\" for foreigners to get, Mr. Fisher said. Interest rates run 2.1 to 3.5 percent. For a first purchase of more than 10 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.3 million), 60 percent down is required.\\n\\nSome banks offer supplemental mortgages up to 80 percent, and developers can offer private financing up to 80 percent, \"which improves the affordability,\" Mr. Fisher said.\\n\\nWebsites\\n\\nHong Kong tourism: discoverhongkong.com\\n\\nRating and Valuation Department: rvd.gov.hk\\n\\nHong Kong Estate Agents Authority: eaa.org.hk\\n\\nLanguages and Currency\\n\\nChinese, English; Hong Kong dollar (1 Hong Kong dollar = $0.13)\\n\\nTaxes and Fees\\n\\n\"There is no property tax in Hong Kong,\" Ms. Chan said, noting that \"all residential land is leasehold,\" meaning it is owned by the Chinese government under 50-year land leases.\\n\\nFor this apartment, the quarterly government rent is 5,917 Hong Kong dollars ($750). The monthly maintenance fee is 1,800 Hong Kong dollars ($230).\\n\\nContact\\n\\nCharis Chan, List Sotheby\\'s International Realty, 011-852-3793-3688; sothebysrealty.com\\n\\nFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

It\\'s a strategy that could lead to a messy, protracted legal fight, but even if the White House is eventually defeated in court, the president and his allies could have the chance to run out the clock to the 2020 election.\\n\\n\"This is all about delaying things. The strategy of every administration is to drag it out,\" said the University of Virginia\\'s Saikrishna Prakash, an expert on presidential power.\\n\\nTrump in recent days has complained about House Democrats stepping up their investigations in the aftermath of the special counsel\\'s probe , which ended last month without concluding the president colluded with Russia or obstructed justice.\\n\\n\"With all of this transparency, we finished \\'no collusion, no obstruction,\\'\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. \"Then I get out, the first the day they\\'re saying, \\'Let\\'s do it again.\\' And I said, \\'That\\'s enough.\\'\"\\n\\n\"So, if I\\'m guilty of anything, it\\'s that I\\'ve been a great president and the Democrats don\\'t like it, which is a shame,\" he said.\\n\\nExecutive privilege is the president\\'s power to keep information from the courts, Congress and the public to protect the confidentiality of the Oval Office decision-making process.\\n\\nThe privilege to withhold documents and prohibit aides from testifying rests on the proposition that the president has an almost unparalleled need to protect the confidentiality of candid advice that goes into presidential judgments. There is no reference to executive privilege in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court has held that it derives from the president\\'s ability to carry out the duties the commander in chief holds under the Constitution.\\n\\nIt has become a flashpoint after Trump\\'s administration signaled it was considering invoking the privilege to block Congress\\' attempt to subpoena former White House counsel Don McGahn, an important figure in the Mueller investigation, to appear and provide documents.\\n\\nThat reflects a shift in legal tactics for Trump\\'s lawyers. At first, they cooperated with Mueller\\'s 22-month investigation, encouraging officials to testify and turning over more than a million documents. But starting last spring, the White House took a far more adversarial approach, publicly questioning the investigation\\'s integrity and resisting some requests.\\n\\nAdvisers to the president, trying to depict the Democrats as guilty of partisan-fueled overreach, want to snarl the congressional investigations. They believe a drawn-out court fight could tire voters\\' patience and shift public opinion their way. While they are hopeful that the courts support them, a legal battle that ends in defeat could stretch close to the 2020 election and make it easier for Republicans to claim the other party was predominantly interested in playing politics.\\n\\nThe haste with which House Democrats have issued subpoenas and promise more is itself a reflection that time is on Trump\\'s side, not Congress\\', Prakash said. \"The speed with which we\\'ve come to an impasse is different\" from past fights over documents and testimony that involved at least a semblance of negotiations, he said.\\n\\nCourts have not had much to say about executive privilege. But in the 1974 case over President Richard Nixon\\'s refusal to release Oval Office recordings as part of the Watergate investigation, the Supreme Court held that the privilege is not absolute. In other words, the case for turning over documents or allowing testimony may be more compelling than arguments for withholding them. In that context, the court ruled 8-0 that Nixon had to turn over the tapes.\\n\\nWhen it came to the Watergate tapes, the Supreme Court said it had the final word, and lower courts have occasionally weighed in to resolve other disputes. But courts also have made clear they prefer that the White House and Congress resolve their disagreements without judicial intervention, when possible.\\n\\nCourt fights over documents and testimony can take years to resolve.\\n\\nOne potential roadblock for the White House: Trump already allowed McGahn to talk to Mueller\\'s team, and Attorney General William Barr has said the president did not invoke executive privilege to prevent release of any part of Mueller\\'s report.\\n\\n\"In view of that, the White House has waived a good portion of any privilege it might claim,\" said Steven Schwinn, a constitutional law professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.\\n\\nTrump seems to be arguing that the risk that McGahn might reveal the substance of high-level conversations he had with the president or other high-level advisers is sufficiently high to keep him out of the witness chair in a House hearing, Schwinn said.\\n\\n\"But that\\'s not the way privileges work,\" he said. \"You don\\'t prevent someone from testifying entirely just because you think one of their answers may raise executive communications. You raise a privilege in response to a question.\"\\n\\nRecent presidents have leaned on the approach. President George W. Bush used it to shield some sensitive information from Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks. The Clinton administration used it to try to keep private Hillary Clinton\\'s answers during the Monica Lewinsky investigation.\\n\\nOver just the past few days, the Trump White House has thrown up a series of hurdles for congressional investigators:\\n\\n-- the Trump Organization sued the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee to stop his efforts to obtain the company\\'s financial records.\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin blew past Tuesday\\'s House deadline to turn over the president\\'s tax returns, saying he will decide next month.\\n\\n-- the administration instructed its former personnel security director, Carl Kline, not to testify before Congress over how some West Wing aides, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, obtained security clearances. That led the House to hold Kline in contempt.\\n\\nOne potential problem Schwinn identified is a lack of clarity in the White House\\'s claims that Trump aides, including Stephen Miller, Trump\\'s top immigration policy adviser, should not cooperate with Congress.\\n\\n\"In a regular administration, we expect the White House to make aggressive constitutional arguments,\" Schwinn said. \"But what President Trump is doing is something different. He\\'s making these assertions that are both overly broad, even ridiculously broad, and in a slippery way so that we can\\'t get our arms around what he is asserting.\"\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\\n\\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Sherman at http://twitter.com/@shermancourt', 'source': {'uri': 'abcnews.go.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@abcnews.go.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_170a8fb7a2164e7696200c997617094b_16x9_992.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 54}\n",

The companies in the S&P 500 have already saved enough to pay for a wall, based on Trump's latest fencing plan, that could stretch the entire length of the U.S.-Mexico border and all the way across the Gulf of Mexico, twice, and still have $20 billion to spare. The savings could also pay for the government's annual grant to the Special Olympics, based on current funding, for the next 9,696 years.\\n\\nThe first quarter ended on Friday, and investors are bracing for what looks like a disappointing earnings season. Profits are supposed to shrink 3.6 percent on average for the companies in the S&P 500. But those earnings would have been worse without 2017's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which saved the S&P 500 companies a projected $30.1 billion in the first quarter, based on analysts' estimates, and $174.5 billion since the beginning of 2018, enough to pay for 6,500 miles of wall.\\n\\nStill, the sputtering corporate profits indicate the big tax cut is not delivering as advertised. Of course, the profit disappointment could be a good thing for the economy if it turns out companies put more money into workers' pockets. There is some evidence of that, but not much. Wages are up 3.5 percent in the past year, according to the most recent jobs report, but that is after years of stagnation. The average monthly job gain has risen by about 35,000 positions a month since the tax bill. But job gains moderated last month to a gain of just 20,000 total, down from 2018's monthly average gain of 223,000. And it's clear that companies are diverting a lot of the tax cut windfall to their shareholders. Last week, S&P Dow Jones Indices reported that the S&P 500 companies bought back $806.4 billion in shares last year, a record, up $287 billion from the year before, or roughly twice what companies saved from the tax law last year.\\n\\nBut there is some good news for taxpayers. The projected cost of the corporate rate cut for the federal government, and ultimately all U.S. citizens, if it runs for 10 years as planned, has dropped $50 billion from just three months ago. Of course, the reason is because growth, in particular this year and next, will not be as strong as expected just a few months ago. Still, the tax savings for corporate America for the next decade could top $1.9 trillion, or enough for roughly 71,000 miles of fencing, which could wrap the continental U.S. three times, with 11,399 miles of extra fencing to spare.\\n\\nI estimated the cost of building a wall based on Trump's $5.7 billion request for 2019, which led to the partial government shutdown. The Department of Homeland Security at the time said that that funding would allow it to build 215 miles of physical barriers along the border between Mexico and the United States. That translates into roughly $26.5 million per mile. S&P 500 companies have saved 1,000 times that in the past three months alone.\\n\\nAs in the past, I calculated the tax savings of corporate America by looking at the projected tax provisions of companies in the S&P 500 for the first three months of this year, and comparing the rate they are paying this year with the average rate those same companies paid in the four years before the tax law changed. Tax provisions are not actual tax payments, but it's a decent approximation. Companies are not required to disclose their actual tax filings. For the first quarter, Trump's tax cut lifted profit for companies in the S&P 500 by a likely collective $30.1 billion. The average total tax rate paid by those companies was 19 percent, including all taxes they paid anywhere, not just U.S. federal income taxes. That number is based on the latest analysts' estimates and could still change. The estimate is slightly more than the $29.9 billion in tax savings those same companies had in the first quarter a year ago.\\n\\nOf course, the absence of a tax cut would be no guarantee of wall funding because of those political and social arguments we set aside earlier. Nor is it clear how corporate profits or the economy would have changed without the tax cuts. Both could have been much more sluggish. But in terms of looking at the world in ways that Trump just might, the tax cut could buy a lot of wall.\", 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'elaine_he_assisted@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Elaine He Assisted', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'stephen_gandel@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Stephen Gandel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/icBfbpj0FgWY/v1/1200x800.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1529411764705881, 'wgt': 53}\n",

Now with the internet, people can still operate their businesses while residing here.\"\\n\\nHome prices on Jersey are \"probably on a par with central London,\" said Aimee Sinclair-Horgan, a partner with the Wilsons Knight Frank agency in Jersey.\\n\\nAt £491,000 (about $648,000), the average home price on Jersey in the fourth quarter of 2018 was higher than that in London, at £476,000 ($630,000), and more than twice that in the United Kingdom overall, according to Statistics Jersey, the government agency that tracks statistics on the island.\\n\\nWhile home sales grew by 5.3 percent from 2017 to 2018, sales of homes at £1 million ($1.3 million) and above grew by 34.2 percent, said Oliver Knight, an associate for residential research at Wilsons Knight Frank. Homes valued over £500,000 ($660,000) accounted for 44.9 percent of the sales in 2018, up from 35.4 percent in 2017.\\n\\nAmong wealthier buyers, the properties currently most in demand are contemporary homes on the cliffs above St. Brelade\\'s Bay, a beach area on the southwestern coast, Ms. Sinclair-Horgan said.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, Ms. Sinclair-Horgan said, the mean price of a one-bedroom apartment on Jersey was £238,000 ($315,000); that of a two-bedroom apartment was £400,000 ($528,000); that of a two-bedroom house was £456,000 ($602,000); that of a three-bedroom house was £580,000 ($765,000); and that of a four-bedroom house was £928,000 ($1.2 million).\\n\\nWho Buys on Jersey\\n\\nBecause the Jersey government tightly regulates the housing market, the vast majority of off-island buyers are from the United Kingdom, although there are occasionally buyers from Europe and other countries, Mr. Torode said.\\n\\nThose with an \"essential work permit\" can apply for a license to buy a home in Jersey. Most buyers who fall into this category are from the United Kingdom, although some are from offshore financial jurisdictions similar to Jersey, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Cayman Islands and Geneva, Mr. Meiklejohn said.\\n\\nWealthy individuals who want to live on Jersey can apply for an \"entitled high-value residency,\" which basically requires an annual income of at least £725,000 ($957,000), Ms. Sinclair-Horgan said, and is a prerequisite for applying for entitled status to buy a home.\\n\\nIn recent years, a dozen or more high-value approvals have been granted annually. According to another Wilsons Knight Frank report, between 2013 and 2017, 66 percent of those granted this status came from England, while 8.5 percent were from Switzerland, 4.7 percent from Scotland, 2.8 percent from Australia and 10.4 percent from the rest of the world.\\n\\nBuying Basics\\n\\nApplications to buy a home or establish residency on Jersey are assessed on a case-by-case basis, brokers said.\\n\\n\"A lot of it is basically to regulate the population,\" Mr. Meiklejohn said. \"It\\'s a small island with a population of about 110,000 people, and there are a lot of green belts, so space is at a premium.\"\\n\\nLocate Jersey, a government-backed organization that promotes Jersey and assists individuals looking to move there, is often the first stop for foreigners who want to set up a business or live on Jersey. Immigration regulations and rules can be found on the Jersey government website.\\n\\nOff-island buyers should hire a lawyer to represent them, brokers said. A lawyer\\'s fee is usually about 1 percent of a home\\'s sale price, but rates can vary.\\n\\nThe biggest closing cost is the stamp duty, which is assessed on a sliding scale. This home\\'s stamp duty at full asking price would be 3.7 percent, or about £71,750 ($95,000), with an £80 ($105) registration fee, Mr. Torode said.\\n\\nMortgages from local banks are available to off-island home buyers, Ms. Sinclair-Horgan said.\\n\\nWebsites\\n\\nJersey travel: jersey.com\\n\\nJersey government: gov.je\\n\\nLocate Jersey: locatejersey.com\\n\\nLanguages and Currency\\n\\nEnglish, Jèrriais; British pound (£1 = $1.32)\\n\\nTaxes and Fees\\n\\nThe annual property taxes on this home are about £968 a year, or about $1,300, Mr. Torode said.\\n\\nContact\\n\\nSimon Torode, Livingroom, 011-44-1534-717100; livingroom.je\\n\\nFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

The former Boeing Co. executive has the dubious distinction of being the longest serving \"Acting Defense Secretary\" in the nation\\'s history.\\n\\n\"I am honored by today\\'s announcement of President Trump\\'s intent to nominate. If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy,\" he said in a statement. \"I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.\"\\n\\nShanahan\\'s nomination was initially held up because Defense Department Inspector General had launched an investigation into whether he violated any ethics rules by promoting his longtime former employer while serving in the Trump Administration. The Pentagon watchdog cleared him. Now he has another hurdle: Congress.\\n\\nShanahan, who has relatively little foreign policy experience and no military service, would assume the top job at one of the most chaotic periods in recent history.\\n\\nThe U.S. is facing headwinds in virtually every corner of the globe. There\\'s a tense stand-off with Iran. A chilly relationship with China. The unrest in Venezuela risks bubbling over into a bloody conflict. Russia continues to make problems for the U.S in Europe. The Taliban shows no sign of retreat in Afghanistan. The military is still juggling the continued fight against terror groups across the Middle East and Africa.\\n\\nAdd to that the litany of other issues putting pressure on the liberal international order that won the Cold War and advanced American interests for a half century.\\n\\nShanahan\\'s lack of experience already made him a target from a bipartisan group of lawmakers during the Munich Security Conference in February when he defended Trump\\'s decision to pull American troops from Syria, where they are currently fighting ISIS.\\n\\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina reportedly called him an \"adversary\" after Shanahan offered explanations of why the troops should come home. Graham is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will decide whether Shanahan\\'s nomination moves forward to a larger vote.\\n\\nShanahan has also faced Congressional grilling over deepening Pentagon entanglements in the Administration\\'s immigration policy. Both parties on Capitol Hill have asked tough questions about the months-long troop presence along the southern border with Mexico. The Pentagon is also on the hook to help build a wall along the border and to help shelter 5,000 migrant children caught crossing the U.S. southern border without a parent.\\n\\nHe now has a daunting task of navigating this minefield, while also managing the expectations of a demanding Commander-in-Chief.\\n\\nAt the Pentagon, Shanahan has assumed the role of a technocrat, leading efforts to cut wasteful spending and create a standalone Space Force -- a priority for Trump. He\\'s maintained a low public profile thus far, and he has not forged strong ties around Washington like Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had garnered.\\n\\nA Washington state native, Shanahan initially stepped into the No. 2 spot at the Pentagon in 2017 after leaving his career at Boeing. A mechanical engineer by trade, with two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shanahan quietly turned around some of Boeing\\'s most troubled programs, including a multibillion-dollar missile defense system and the problem-plagued 787 commercial airliner. His success earned him the nickname \"Mr. Fix-It\" inside the company.\\n\\nTrump picked Shanahan based upon his \"outstanding service\" and \"demonstrated ability to lead,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

The captain said that rescued migrants had begun to riot and threaten violence when they saw that the ship was returning them to Libya. According to the captain, they forced it to turn north toward Europe.\\n\\nThe suspects pleaded not guilty during an arraignment in Valletta, the Maltese capital, on Saturday. One of the accused was identified by the court as Abdalla Bari, a 19-year-old from Guinea. The other two are a 15-year-old from Guinea and a 16-year-old from Ivory Coast, who could not be named because they were minors.\\n\\nA magistrate, Donatella Frendo Dimech, denied a bail request, noting that civilian witnesses, including the captain and crew, had yet to testify and that the accused had no ties in Malta nor any means of paying bond.\\n\\nEfforts to Rescue Migrants Caused Deadly, Unexpected Consequences\\n\\nStrategies to reduce migrants in the Mediterranean Sea may have made the journey more treacherous.\\n\\nThe minors told the court that they were high school students, while Mr. Bari, the 19-year-old, said that he had been studying sociology before leaving his country.\\n\\nUnder Maltese law, unlawfully seizing control of a ship can be considered a terrorist activity and is punishable by seven to 30 years in prison.\\n\\nThe tanker was heading to Libya from Turkey when it was asked on Tuesday to divert its course to rescue nearly 100 migrants in distress, which it did, before continuing on its course. But when the migrants realized on Wednesday that they were headed back to Libya, which they had just left, some apparently revolted and commandeered the ship.\\n\\nThe temporary hijacking was described by Italy's hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, as piracy. Some aid groups, however, called it an act of self-defense against Europe's immigration policies, which often result in the shipping of desperate migrants back to Libya, where they can face beatings, rape and torture in detention camps.\\n\\nEuropean Union states have been at loggerheads over migration since a surge in Mediterranean arrivals caught the bloc by surprise in 2015, stretching social and security services and fueling support for far-right, nationalist and populist groups.\\n\\nSea arrivals have fallen from more than one million in the peak year to about 140,000 people last year, according to United Nations data.

Tom Cotton discussed what happened at the meeting with President Trump on his plan to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.\\n\\nSen. Tom Cotton said on Wednesday that President Trump laid out two broad approaches to immigration reform in a meeting the previous day with 12 Republican senators.\\n\\nThe Arkansas Republican said on \"Fox & Friends\" that the president described a policy that focuses on modernizing border security and calls for a merit-based system.\\n\\n\"The first (approach) is immediate and urgent,\" Cotton said, \"it\\'s addressing the crisis at our southern border where we had over 100,000 illegal border crossing apprehensions last month. That\\'s going to be reforming our asylum laws to make sure that we don\\'t have people committing fraud, showing up, getting a piece of paper from some left-wing lawyer and saying some magic words that lets them into the country olly olly oxen free.\"\\n\\nTRUMP ORDERS ASYLUM OVERHAUL, INCLUDING NEW FEE FOR APPLICATIONS AND FASTER ADJUDICATIONS, AMID \\'SEVERE\\' BORDER CRISIS\\n\\n\"We also had a big victory on that, by the way, yesterday in the court system,\" Cotton added. \"Secretary of State (Mike) Pompeo in a negotiated agreement with the Mexican government (said) that they would keep Central Americans in their countries while those asylum claims are processed. The courts finally just said that agreement can go forward, a very common sense victory. So that was the first part of the conversation.\"\\n\\nCotton said shifting to a high skilled-merit-based immigration system was the second part of the conversation at Tuesday\\'s meeting, adding it\\'s something he has worked on \"a lot over the last few years.\"\\n\\n\"Today we have way too many people coming into the country who are unskilled workers or low-skilled workers and that\\'s driving down American wages,\" Cotton said.\\n\\n\"What we need are more people who are doctors, or computer scientists, engineers. And that\\'s the direction the president wants to go as he said in the past, they laid out some broad principles yesterday. I think we had pretty widespread agreement on those principles.\"\\n\\n9TH CIRCUIT BREAKS WITH ANOTHER APPELLATE COURT, RULES ASYLUM APPLICANTS HAVE RIGHT TO GO BEFORE FEDERAL JUDGE\\n\\nCotton, known for his support for strict immigration measures, added that \"more and more Democrats across the country are coming to recognize\" that \"there really is a crisis.\"\\n\\n\"Triple the number of Democrats last month said that we have a crisis at our border as had said the previous month. Democrats in Congress may not have gotten that message yet but that kind of growing recognition among the American people that we face a crisis at the border ultimately cannot help but reach the Congress,\" Cotton said.\\n\\n\"There are a lot of asylum laws that are well-intentioned but are being abused by people who simply want to come into the country for a chance to make more money and send that money back home.

Milling around the brand new entryway on Manhattan\\'s 11th St., workers are putting the finishing touches on what was a massive refurbishment of the famed East Village space. Nearby sit stacks of boxes filled with final supplies, and on the wall, newly-installed television screens covered in protective plastic wait to be powered up. Elsewhere, a gaggle of artist representatives tour the space, marveling at the revamp.\\n\\n\"Agents and managers are seeing it for the the first time this week, and the reactions have been outstanding,\" says John Moore, Bowery Presents partner and founder. \"From the day we started, industry response has been through the roof.\"\\n\\nAfter BSE Global and The Bowery Presents (and Bowery\\'s parent company AEG) acquired the operating rights for and assets of Webster Hall in February 2017, New Yorkers reacted to the news with incredulity: Webster, an independent venue, was now destined to be yet another Big Apple landmark swallowed up, unrecognizably altered and irrevocably corporatized.\\n\\nBut luckily for longtime fans of the venue, the project to renovate the space wasn\\'t done from a faraway corporate office, but under the tutelage of previous longtime Webster fans and clubgoers who fully understood the club\\'s lore.\\n\\nThat includes Moore, who booked the venue\\'s artists from 2004 to 2014. (Bowery Presents previously had an exclusive booking deal with the venue\\'s former private owners, the Ballinger family.) Moore himself has attended countless shows. \"It was important to keep the original flavor of the space 100 percent, as much as possible,\" he explains. Brett Yormark, CEO of BSE Global, echoes those sentiments, emphasizing the team was deliberate in their approach. \"We wanted to ensure that we were true to the spirit and the history of the venue,\" Yormark says. \"There are many traditions and characteristics we maintained, while other aspects have been contemporized to adapt to today\\'s standards.\"\\n\\nAs such, bridging the tricky gap of preserving the vibe of Webster Hall while updating it for future generations influenced nearly every decision. Perhaps one of the biggest changes is a revamped lounge that originally served as the Marlin Room. Aesthetically toeing a line between modern and throwback -- the design on the wall was inspired by original patterns elsewhere in the building -- it now lives as a massive room that greets visitors off the street with a large bar, which itself is accented repurposed fluted glass windows taken from other locations in the building. \"If people want to have a drink before the show, this is a great space for that,\" says Sheldon, who notes tentative plans to have the bar open before attendees are let into the Grand Ballroom on some nights.\\n\\nAnother notable change is the elimination of the Studio at Webster Hall, a downstairs performance space that sometimes clashed with the overall atmosphere. \"There\\'d be an \\'80s dance party downstairs and someone like [the tender singer-songwriter] Ray LaMontagne upstairs,\" says Moore of the switch. Now, the newly singular focus is on the venue\\'s Grand Ballroom. Aesthetically similar to the Webster of the past, it\\'s been outfitted with a state-of-the-art sound and lighting rig. \"We wanted to stay true to the sound that people know and love here, but also add some enhancements to make the experience that much better,\" says Sheldon, who brought a bevy of expert acousticians in to meet the challenge, working with Arup and Sonic Designs. \"We wanted to make sure this is the best-sounding room in the city.\" The team also worked with BML-Blackbird on lighting enhancements, which still utilize some of the original rig.\\n\\nElsewhere inside, the team used their own experiences at Webster to fix previous fallbacks: a bar was shifted from center to stage right to prevent crowd bottlenecks and improve sightlines on the Grand Ballroom\\'s balcony; an elevator was installed to make each floor handicap accessible; and existing bathrooms were modernized with additional facilities. Webster\\'s dressing rooms also boast a complete upgrade inspired by Moore\\'s run as the venue\\'s booker. \"We originally had only two tiny rooms and it was brutal,\" recalls Moore, who made expanding dressing rooms to please even the most extravagant artist rider a priority. \"They weren\\'t intentionally bad before, but we just needed more space.\"\\n\\nFor Webster Hall, it was the very first soup-to-nuts renovation in the building\\'s long history. First opened in 1886, the venue was initially designed to be utilized for everything from weddings to labor union rallies. Meetings of the defense team of the legendary 1920s-era immigrant court case against Sacco and Vanzetti took place at Webster, and anti-fascist configurations were held in the space during World War II. Simultaneously, the venue was also known for its famed masquerade balls which attracted the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Langston Hughes, and garnered such a debaucherous reputation that Webster earned the dubious moniker in the press of Devil\\'s Playhouse.\\n\\nAfter a series of fires plagued the building and the wild bashes came to an end, the venue continued as a performance space -- early acts include Woody Guthrie and Tito Puente -- and, in 1953, RCA Records took it over and turned it into the first-of-its-kind polyphonic recording studio. \"Their smaller studios couldn\\'t fit huge orchestras,\" says Sheldon. \"So musicians would perform in the Grand Ballroom and it\\'d be piped down into the basement where it was recorded.\" The original cast albums for Hello Dolly! (with Carol Channing) and Fiddler on the Roof were cut at Webster, as were seminal records by the likes of Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. In the fall of 1955, Harry Belafonte recorded his classic \"Day-O (Banana Boat Song)\" at the venue, and later enlisted a young troubadour named Bob Dylan to play harmonica for his 1962 album Midnight Special, thus making Webster the site of Dylan\\'s recording debut.\\n\\nBy the 1980s, the venue went through another change: it dropped its Webster moniker and was subsequently known as The Ritz, making it a pop and rock mecca for the glam decade that hosted stars including Lou Reed, the Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once the Ritz era came to a close, the venue reopened once again under its original name in 1992 when it was purchased by the Ballinger family and hosted memorable events including special sets by Prince and Mick Jagger and a slumber party courtesy of Madonna. In later years, the club made headlines thanks to a non-performance courtesy of Kanye West.\\n\\nWith all that in mind, when Webster Hall greets the public again for the first time tonight (April 26), there will be subtle hints to its history peppered around the space: 80s-era show posters are plastered backstage, while the original Ritz logo adorns the outside of the aforementioned revamped lounge. \"We also found one unique piece under the floorboards of the stage,\" says Sheldon, referring to massive, wall-sized Italian-language poster for the 1956 Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean classic Giant. While its origins are murky -- perhaps the film\\'s score was recorded at Webster, or maybe its New York premiere held its after party there -- it\\'s now on proud display after being hidden in plain sight for a half century. \"On one hand it\\'s not specific to Webster Hall, but it is to us.\"\\n\\nA new era of performers will soon usher in the latest iteration of Webster Hall, with its initial calendar aptly full of New York City luminaries ranging from Patti Smith to a full-day event thanks to Vampire Weekend. But the reopening will have an even bigger NYC star. \"When we first open up the room, we knew we had to have an iconic artist,\" says Sheldon, referring to Jay Z, who will become the venue\\'s first performer when he delivers a special show consisting of B-Sides tonight. \"We thought it was a natural extension to bring him into the fold at Webster Hall and have him reintroduce the venue.\"\\n\\nJay Marciano, the chairman/CEO of AEG Presents, notes that one of Webster\\'s goals is to book a dynamic mix of artists. \"Beginning on Friday night with Jay-Z and continuing with an eclectic line-up of artists throughout its opening month, it\\'s now up to our guests to decide if we achieved all that set out to accomplish,\" he said. Yormark, meanwhile, is quick to note the gargantuan task to bring Webster Hall into the current age was also a worthy one. \"When I was first made aware that there could be an opportunity to acquire Webster Hall, I knew it was something we had to make happen,\" he says. \"[Especially] given how special the venue is to both this city and the music industry.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'billboard.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Billboard'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'rob_ledonne@billboard.com', 'name': 'Rob LeDonne', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.billboard.com/files/media/webster-hall-reopening-exterior-Nicole-Pereira-2019-billboard-1548.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4751943', 'sentiment': 0.1372549019607843, 'wgt': 44}\n",

He\\'s not just worried about the prospect of another shutdown Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year and when the current round of funding expires, but a second shutdown on Oct. 1, 2020, right before the presidential election.\\n\\nThe chances of another shutdown are high, considering that Trump went around Congress to declare a national emergency in order to marshal money for the border wall. The courts will determine whether that maneuver was constitutional, but the president\\'s action alone bolstered the chances of another shutdown. The possibility increased even further after Congress failed to override Trump\\'s veto of a measure to terminate the national emergency.\\n\\nMcConnell felt burned by the president after he forged ahead with a government spending plan in December, only to have Trump tell then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., he wouldn\\'t sign the package. So after congressional leaders forged a mid-February deal to run the government through this fall, McConnell sped to the floor to publicly announce Trump\\'s intention to sign the measure. McConnell\\'s move locked in the president, lest he try to renege. McConnell understands Trump\\'s fickle and volatile approach to governing. The president dumped McConnell and Ryan under the bus during a 2017 Oval Office meeting in favor of a spending gambit pushed by Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Wiser for that experience, McConnell knows the best bet is to secure broad, long-term buy-in from the White House and Congress on a topline spending measure to avoid potential shutdowns - pre-empting Trump\\'s incessant oscillations.\\n\\nLet\\'s examine exactly what\\'s at stake. You may hear these negotiations referred to rhetorically as a \"caps deal.\" This refers to an effort to establish total spending caps for discretionary spending (read: anything but entitlements) for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The \"caps\" refer to a set of mandatory spending restrictions (known as sequestration) which Congress imposed as part of the debt ceiling agreement in 2011. The goal is to make everyone happy as long as they can reach a topline accord for all spending by eliminating the caps. The advantage for Trump and many Republicans? Military spending and some additional money for a border wall. The advantage for Democrats? More spending on everything else.\\n\\nDebts and deficits? Forget about it.\\n\\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS POSTPONE BUDGET MEASURE VOTE AMID PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\\n\\nSure, some fiscally-conservative Blue Dog Democrats may balk, as will fiscal conservatives like Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Mike Lee, R-Utah. But the key here is the right mixture of Democrats and Republicans. In divided government, leaders need to secure buy-in from both parties and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. But remember, these are discussions focused on overall spending numbers, not specific appropriations. A dispute over the latter is what led to the monstrous government shutdown in December and January.\\n\\nHouse Democrats drew criticism two weeks ago when they yanked their budget blueprint off the floor because they lacked the votes to adopt it as divergent voices split the caucus. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told Fox that if the budget (which only sets broad spending guidelines and is not binding) \"had been critical ... I think Nancy (Pelosi) and I could have gotten it passed.\"\\n\\nHoyer pointed out that the discussions with the administration and McConnell are more \"substantive.\" That\\'s true. The budget House Democrats aimed to approve was simply a wish list, much like President Trump\\'s budget in the winter. So, if the sides can get an agreement on spending caps, that would, in theory, make it easier to focus on the hard part, which is appropriations.\\n\\nHere\\'s the issue with the sequestration caps: Sequestration always hits the military hardest because Congress spends the most on the Pentagon. Sequestration restricts the Pentagon to $576 billion for fiscal year 2020 and could impose a cut of $71 billion to defense next year and $55 billion for non-defense programs.\\n\\nTRUMP, GOP PLAN TO RESCIND BUDGET SPENDING HAS PRECEDENT BUT FACES ROCKY PATH IN CONGRESS\\n\\nTrump and defense hawks want to spend more on the military. So, if they get a \"caps deal,\" and cancel sequestration, they can spend a lot more. Of course, the deal must be made with congressional Democrats who also want to eliminate sequestration caps on non-defense spending.\\n\\nEven though the House failed to adopt a budget this week, Democrats did set an overall discretionary spending figure (encompassing all 12 appropriations bills) of $1.295 trillion for fiscal year 2020. This excludes non-discretionary spending which includes entitlement spending.\\n\\nBut here are the politics: Both sides believe if they can get the president on board with the defense hikes, he could sign off on other Democratic priorities. And if both houses of Congress are behind the plan, Trump could agree and avoid the shutdowns.\\n\\nThe gambit would establish new spending caps for the remainder of the president\\'s term, drastically reducing the chances of shutdowns while baking in a debt limit increase. They could also forge a deal on a supplemental spending bill to cover a host of natural disasters, from Puerto Rico to flooding in the Midwest. One GOP plan to address natural disasters is stalled in the Senate.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"If we can come to the agreement with the Senate, that puts the onus on the White House,\" said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky. \"There will be no way [Trump] can explain it away. If he wants that [responsibility of a shutdown], it\\'s on his shoulders.\"\\n\\nPelosi and Schumer are slated to visit the White House Tuesday to discuss a possible infrastructure plan with Trump. The last time Pelosi and Schumer huddled with the president in the Oval Office, sparks flew as the leaders verbally sparred with one another on live TV. The conclave produced one of the most memorable episodes of the Trump presidency. This tableau could prompt similar combat, even though the subject matter is infrastructure. The border wall dispute and immigration policy will remain a flashpoint as long as this president is in office and won\\'t be settled by any caps agreement.\\n\\nThat\\'s why many want to get started on a spending arrangement now.

To be reductive, because the news about plastic is getting scarier, more of us are seeing it, and we lead an increasingly large portion of our lives on public forums (such as Instagram) that generate visibility of environmental issues and the social pressure to mitigate them. It also doesn\\'t hurt that millennials and Gen Z are confronting the fact that, as their years on planet earth stretch out before them, so too do the rapidly approaching effects of climate change -- water shortages, famine, extreme weather, rising sea-levels, and destabilized societies.\\n\\nBad press for plastic is pervasive. One week it\\'s a dead whale with 64 pounds of trash in its stomach in Spain. A few weeks later, it\\'s one with 88 pounds in the Philippines. An impressive number of us could probably rattle off that 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic are floating at the top of the Great Pacific garbage patch. (Ten times more than there are stars in our Milky Way Galaxy.) Fewer would know that it\\'s also made its way into our bodies, and was observed in eight out of eight human feces scientists tested in 2018.\\n\\nThis has resulted in a comparably rare plastic backlash. In 2016, a Greenpeace petition for a UK-wide plastic microbead ban hit 365,000 signatures in just four months -- becoming the largest environmental petition ever presented to a government. While climate change is an abstract concept to many, plastics -- what you buy, use, and throw away every week of your life -- is concrete. It makes you ask, what can I do to stop this?\\n\\nNow, consumers are putting pressure on companies to nix virgin plastics. The charge is led primarily by millennials, people who have grown up in an era of globalization and economic disruption and have, as a result, perhaps missed out on an implicit trust in the infallibility of greater institutions. Familiar with \"fake news\" online, and armed with instantaneous search results from Google, they\\'re natural-born skeptics.\\n\\nStatistically speaking, they\\'re right to worry. A landmark United Nations report said if the world doesn\\'t utterly transform energy systems in the next decade, we risk ecological and social disaster. But climate change is deeply politicized in the US, and it makes our most effective, easiest option -- sweeping legislation -- unlikely. While we\\'ve made over eight billion tons of plastic in the last 60 years (virtually every piece of which still exists in some shape or form on earth), we\\'re still using more virgin plastic today than ever before.\\n\\nBut millennials have significant sway. They comprise roughly 30% of the population and were projected to overtake Baby Boomers as America\\'s largest living adult generation in 2019, a number that\\'s growing (due to variables like young immigrants bolstering numbers) while Boomers\\' drop. They have significant purchasing power: They spend $600 billion each year in the US alone, and they represent $2.45 trillion in spending power globally.\\n\\nCompanies that have wised up to the sustainability trend are capitalizing on the unpopularity of plastics. Many of those companies are young digital startups, spearheaded by millennials themselves who may have first seen the market need or grown up with the same sensibility that achieving a net good is every person and company\\'s responsibility. They have the added advantage of building their companies from the ground up to suit today\\'s customer, rather than renovating an existing structure. Like a socially-conscious Darwinian contest, they\\'re the ones poised to gain from the market opportunities created by their peers -- a smart, skeptical group of shoppers with long lives to live, money to spend, and socio-civic concerns.', 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'mara_leighton@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'Mara Leighton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cb5ff43014283006c0f0cd7-1920-960.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.02745098039215677, 'wgt': 37}\n",

Most of the fencing was built during the administration of George W. Bush, and there have been updates and maintenance throughout other administrations.\\n\\nTrump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border. His administration has only replaced existing fencing, including the section he is touring Friday.

Canada has argued that the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum are harmful to both countries\\' economies and make little sense given the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement reached late last year.\\n\\n\"We continue to advocate for the complete removal of the tariffs,\" Mr. Morneau said on Thursday afternoon on the sidelines of the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nThe United States and Canada have had continuing negotiations about the removal of the tariffs. One option that the United States has proposed is rolling back the tariffs in exchange for Canada agreeing to quotas on its steel and aluminum exports to the United States.\\n\\nBut Mr. Morneau called replacing tariffs with quotas unacceptable.\\n\\n\"We continue to think that the most appropriate way to move forward is just to fully move away from this approach,\" said Mr. Morneau, who met this week with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative.\\n\\nMr. Trump has pointed to the new trade deal as one of his signature economic accomplishments, but it faces an uncertain path to ratification in the United States. Democrats, who now control the House, are demanding changes to the agreement, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who leads the House, must agree to bring it up for a vote.\\n\\nMs. Pelosi said last week that the House would not vote on the trade deal until Mexico passes new labor laws that are required under the agreement. The revised Mexican labor law, which is devised to give workers greater freedom to organize, passed that nation\\'s lower house on Thursday and could go to the Senate next week.\\n\\nMr. Morneau said that he had been watching the proceedings in Congress carefully and staying in touch with his Mexican counterparts, but said ratification in Canada was also not guaranteed given the tariffs.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a real issue that we have Canadians asking why we don\\'t have agreement on that based on getting to agreement on everything else,\" Mr. Morneau said. \"I made that point to Secretary Mnuchin, that from our perspective steel and aluminum tariffs in two close trading partners don\\'t make sense.\"\\n\\nHe added, \"And they certainly don\\'t make sense in the context of trying to improve our trading relationship by signing a new trade deal.\"\\n\\nMr. Morneau said that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer were aware of Canada\\'s concerns but noted that the steel industry lobby in the United States, which supports the tariffs, is powerful.\\n\\nAt a Senate hearing last month, Mr. Mnuchin suggested that a resolution to the tariffs could coincide with congressional approval of the new trade deal.\\n\\nRepublican lawmakers in the United States have been on Canada\\'s side when it comes to removing the steel and aluminum tariffs.

But when the migrants realized Wednesday they were headed back to lawless Libya, which they had just left, some revolted, commandeering the ship and forcing it to head to Europe.\\n\\nThe temporary hijacking this week of the El Hiblu 1 was described by Italy\\'s hard-line interior minister as an act of \"piracy. \" Aid groups called it an act of \"self-defense\" against Europe\\'s inhumane immigration policies, which aim to ship back desperate migrants to Libya, where they often face beatings, rape and torture in detention camps.\\n\\nFive migrants were arrested after Maltese special forces boarded the ship Thursday, then escorted it to port.\\n\\nThe ship\\'s captain said Maltese authorities had detained and strip-searched him after the ship docked in the capital, Valletta.\\n\\n\"I swear in the name of God, if I find a million people dying in front of me in the sea, I will never rescue them after what I saw here in Malta,\" Nader el Hiblu told The Associated Press by phone from the ship Friday. \"This filthy country treated me in a very disrespectable way after rescuing 98 people. They dealt with me as a criminal and accused me of illegal migration.\"\\n\\nBut the captain\\'s perhaps understandable ire notwithstanding, all boat and ship crews are legally required to rescue anyone in distress at sea. The United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea stipulates captains must \"render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost\" so long as they can do so without \"serious danger to the ship, the crew or the passengers.\"\\n\\nThe risk of hijackings in the Mediterranean has been of concern to the shipping world in recent years, particularly since some European countries began refusing to allow ships with rescued passengers into their ports, industry specialists say.\\n\\n\"We knew it was coming, we have sounded warnings about this frequently,\" John Stawpert, manager for environment and trade at the London-based International Chamber of Shipping, told the AP. \"This episode I think has brought it into sharp focus. What we need is action at a high level, at state level and also international level, to ensure that ships that find themselves, through no fault of their own, in this sort of situation, get immediate assistance.\"\\n\\nCargo ships and their crews are not equipped to deal with large numbers of desperate people suddenly arriving on board. The ICS has called for the coast guards of nearby countries to intervene as quickly as possible in such situations to transfer rescued migrants to safe locations.\\n\\nDespite the risks, Stawpert said it was unlikely commercial ships would start to regularly refuse help to those in distress.\\n\\nThe number of people making the perilous journey from north Africa across the Mediterranean to Europe has fallen steeply in recent years, he noted, and many are being caught by the Libyan coast guard before they get far from the Libyan coast.\\n\\n\"Most importantly, seafarers recognize their legal and moral obligation to conduct search and rescue. It\\'s a very deeply ingrained moral obligation and culture within shipping,\" he said. \"I\\'m confident that people will continue to pick up people in distress.\"\\n\\n-- -- -- --\\n\\nMichael contributed from Cairo.', 'source': {'uri': 'abcnews.go.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'elena_becatoros@abcnews.go.com', 'name': 'Elena Becatoros', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_d3d7840138a548578be56a9344325e78_16x9_992.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2705882352941177, 'wgt': 36}\n",

At least one top Republican agreed.\\n\\nBeto O\\'Rourke and John Cornyn were not often on the same page during the six years that they both represented Texas in Congress. But for a brief moment, O\\'Rourke -- then a Democratic congressman from El Paso and now a 2020 presidential hopeful -- got the powerful Republican senator behind him in his quest to stop the federal government from building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nThe effort ultimately proved for naught, as a barrier ended up being built at the contested site. But O\\'Rourke\\'s successful wooing of the No. 2 Republican in the Senate could prove to be an asset as he goes about pitching himself to primary voters: proof that on Donald Trump\\'s signature issue, he not only has spent years crafting his position but also has some bipartisan credibility to bring to the debate.\\n\\nThe collaboration with Cornyn came in 2013, as U.S. Customs and Border Protection made plans to build a $5.5 million, 17-foot high steel fence along a half-mile portion of the border in El Paso, a city that is separated from Mexico by the Rio Grande and, in most places, high steel walls. At the time, that type of barrier did not exist in this historic part of the city, where Spanish explorers first crossed the river north in 1598.\\n\\nIn El Paso, officials were concerned that building the wall would hamstring efforts to revitalize the area, which had struggled since a huge freeway went up, separating it from the rest of town. The site\\'s supporters wanted to preserve its history and possibly develop it into a tourist destination -- the Southwest\\'s answer to Plymouth Rock.\\n\\nAccording to a report from El Paso Inc., the city let O\\'Rourke, then a freshman congressman, lead the charge to get CBP to back down on the wall. In November 2013, he sat down with Cornyn, Texas\\' senior senator and the second-ranked Republican in the Senate, who has long championed border security measures.\\n\\nAfter meeting with O\\'Rourke, Cornyn wrote a letter to Thomas Winkowski, then acting commissioner of CBP, encouraging him to listen to the congressman. \"I understand that the project is near significant cultural and historical sites, and I would strongly encourage you to work closely with the El Paso community to ensure preservation of sensitive areas,\" the senator wrote.\\n\\nO\\'Rourke and five additional House members wrote a letter to Winkowski the day before saying: \"Preserving the historic significance of this area should be our first priority and we strongly believe that a compromise can be reached.\"\\n\\nThe lawmakers noted that El Paso had just been named the safest city in the country for the third year in a row. \"It seems that there is little need to construct additional fence from a safety perspective when taxpayer dollars could be used more effectively in other areas of the border,\" they wrote.\\n\\nMeanwhile, CBP officials insisted that construction of a wall would not harm the area\\'s cultural and environmental resources, nor its economic value.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Cornyn and O\\'Rourke did not tell The Daily Beast what ultimately came of their moment of cooperation. In May 2014, the El Paso Times reported that O\\'Rourke was still railing against building the wall in this section, but he admitted during a congressional hearing that federal officials were moving forward with the project.\\n\\nThe border now tells the tale: a high, see-through steel fence runs through the area, like it does through the rest of El Paso. Local officials have tried to secure grant money from the National Parks Service to spark development of the site and are awaiting approval. For now, the abandoned swath of land is gathering dust between the freeway and the border wall, listed by a Texas nonprofit as one of the most endangered historic sites in the state.\\n\\nIn the years since they cooperated, the border wall has become a central issue for both O\\'Rourke and Cornyn. O\\'Rourke -- who passed up challenging Cornyn in 2020 to run for president -- has said he wants to tear down the entire border wall in El Paso. When President Trump went to El Paso in February to rally for his immigration agenda, O\\'Rourke staged a counter-rally.\\n\\nCornyn, meanwhile, has become an ally of Trump and largely supports his immigration agenda. He has said in the past that there are parts of the border where it makes no sense to have a wall. But he has also backed the president\\'s emergency declaration to siphon money from other departments to finance construction of a wall along the southern border.\\n\\nCornyn\\'s office did not return a request for comment.', 'source': {'uri': 'thedailybeast.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Beast'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'gideon_resnick@thedailybeast.com', 'name': 'Gideon Resnick', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'sam_brodey@thedailybeast.com', 'name': 'Sam Brodey', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1553023756/190318-resnick-beto-tease_rpmz7a', 'eventUri': 'eng-4675883', 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 35}\n",

That\\'s the question with which we\\'re wrestling as the second woman premier to lead Britain, Theresa May, flounders toward the March 29 date by which, absent a deal or an agreed-upon delay, Britain will finally regain its independence. How would the Iron Lady handle what the nervous Nellies are calling a colossal constitutional crisis?\\n\\nWe understand that Thatcher has left this mortal coil. We focus on her because, as we\\'ve often marked, the idea of Brexit took flight only after Thatcher delivered her famous speech at Bruges, Belgium. That was the speech in which she declared that Britons had not rolled back the frontiers of the state at home only to see \"a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.\"\\n\\nThat was in 1988. The speech inspired many among the conservative intelligentsia in Britain -- the Bruges Group, it got dubbed -- to think about independence. Yet punctilious editorial writing moves us to mark that Mrs. Thatcher herself stopped short of calling for Britain to leave the EU outright. Plus, too, she spoke in a heartfelt way about Britain\\'s historical and cultural ties. Bruges was a moderate speech.\\n\\nThatcher didn\\'t know it at the time, but she herself had but two years left as premier. Her party leaders turned on her in 1990. So how did her thinking go after that? It happens that there is a riveting clue being linked now on the internet (and above). It features remarks that Mrs. Thatcher delivered to a Conservative Party rally at Plymouth, where she lit into the prime minister at the time, Labor\\'s Tony Blair.\\n\\nThe leader of the Conservative opposition, Wm. Hague, did grasp what he called the Labor government\\'s \"contempt for the views of the people it governs.\" Quoth he: \"Talk about Europe and they call you extreme. Talk about tax and they call you greedy. Talk about crime and they call you reactionary. Talk about immigration and they call you racist. Talk about your nation, and they call you Little Englanders.\"\\n\\nYet Mr. Hague was not prepared to take a hard line on Europe. That fell to Thatcher, when she spoke at Plymouth. She did endorse Mr. Hague. Her focus, though, was excoriating Mr. Blair, and his Labor government, for wanting to \"lead in Europe.\" She warned that he would \"lead Britain by the nose into the single currency,\" fairly shouting about Mr. Blair: \"He\\'s prepared to do it.\"\\n\\n\"I would never be prepared to give up our own currency,\" Thatcher fairly bellowed, and then the famous words: \"The greatest issue in this election, indeed the greatest issue before our country, is whether Britain is to remain a free, independent, nation state. Or whether we are to be dissolved in a federal Europe. There are no half measures, no third ways -- and no second chances.\"\\n\\n\"Too many powers have already passed from our Parliament to the bureaucracy in Brussels,\" Thatcher added. \"We must get them back.\"\\n\\nShe dilated on the pound, to surrender which, she reckoned, would be \"to surrender our power of self-government, would betray all that past generations down the ages lived and died to defend. It would also be to turn our back on America, leader of the English-speaking peoples, to whom Europe -- let\\'s remember -- also owes its freedom. That is not our way.\"\\n\\n\"And where better to take a stand than here in Plymouth?\" Thatcher asked. \"Plymouth -- England\\'s historic opening to the world. Plymouth -- from where Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and Captain Cook set out to take the ways of these islands to the uttermost bounds of the earth? Plymouth, from where the Pilgrim Fathers left in that cockle-shell vessel on a voyage which would create the most powerful force for freedom that the world has known?\"\\n\\nPlease forgive the long quotes. They strike us as exactly right as Brexit goes down to the wire. We\\'ve covered this for close to 40 years, and we don\\'t nurse the slightest doubt about what Margaret Thatcher would have done. She\\'d have held out for independence, deal or no deal with Europe (or Ireland) and looked to America, Canada, and the other freedom countries as the way forward.

The contract marks the latest string tying Bay Area technology companies to the U.S. Defense Department, even as some of these companies\\' employees have successfully pushed back against any work that could be considered advancing the technologies of war.\\n\\nAfter a years-long legal and technological fight, Palantir won a lengthy court battle against the Defense Department and then beat out military contracting stalwart Raytheon to win the lucrative contract to provide real-time maps and analytics to soldiers in the field through a system called the Distributed Common Ground System (or DCGS-A).\\n\\nThe U.S. military began its search for DCGS contractors in 2015. Facing off against old school military contractors like Raytheon, Palantir sued the Army in order to be considered. In 2016, a judge agreed with the company that by not initially considering the company\\'s offerings, the Army violated a 1994 law to conduct full market research for commercially available offerings. Palantir sued the U.S. Navy in 2017 for the same reason and with the same result.\\n\\nThe court-room victories and this week\\'s contract award are landmark moments for Palantir, one of nearly a dozen Silicon Valley companies that are flirting with filing for an IPO in 2019. The company, co-founded by Peter Thiel, overcame years of massive bureaucratic resistance to the idea of the Pentagon buying a commercially available data product instead of something custom-built by Raytheon, an East Coast military-industrial institution. (Disclosure: In 2016, Peter Thiel secretly bankrolled a lawsuit against Gizmodo\\'s former owner, Gawker Media, resulting in the company\\'s bankruptcy.)\\n\\nTheil has a decades-long list of headlines behind him. He was a PayPal co-founder, the first outside investor in Facebook, a rare San Francisco Bay Area cheerleader, tech adviser for Donald Trump and a man who is known to spend his multibillion-dollar fortune on ventures like immortality, the singularity, and getting kids to drop out of college, among other things. Palantir is a developer of increasingly common predictive policing technology that\\'s used by law enforcement agencies around the United States. And based on Palantir\\'s opaque contracts with Homeland Security\\'s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, its tech is reportedly helping fuel the agency\\'s accelerated deportations under President Trump.\\n\\nThe new Pentagon contract, which could be worth more than $800 million, comes as both the Defense Department and Silicon Valley have publicly struggled to figure out how to do business together while tech workers and consumers protested the nature of the work.\\n\\nProject Maven, a Defense Department initiative for which Google helped to develop an AI imaging system for military drones, is the most prominent example of the Silicon Valley-Pentagon split. U.S. General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation\\'s top general, met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday to discuss the company\\'s fraught relationship with the Pentagon as well as Google\\'s business in China. (Trump also apparently attended the meeting.)\\n\\nBut for all of the worry about the failing relationship, Silicon Valley and the Pentagon are still very much linked. Even the old contractors, most associated with the Beltway immediately surrounding Washington, D.C., do much of their work in Silicon Valley.\\n\\nPalantir has always aimed to sell its commercial data tools to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. \"Supporting Soldiers in their critical missions, and making sure they come home safely to their families, is a point of immense pride at Palantir. It\\'s why we started the company. We look forward to our partnership with the men and women of the U.S. Army and will do everything we can to ensure this technology makes them more successful,\" Doug Philippone, head of Palantir\\'s Defense Business, told Gizmodo in an email.\\n\\nLess than 10 minutes down the road from Palantir\\'s Palo Alto headquarters, Lockheed Martin runs its Advanced Technology Center where it develops billions of dollars worth of technology including military satellites, artificial intelligence, and laser weapons that it sells to the U.S. military for a business worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Northrop Grumman will do most of the work in nearby Sunnyvale on a recently awarded $273 million contract to build missile launchers for future Navy submarines.\\n\\nAmerica\\'s Big Tech firms are largely still working with the Pentagon. Microsoft recently signed a $480 million contract with the Pentagon to sell the company\\'s HoloLens technology. And Amazon, which already runs the CIA\\'s cloud infrastructure, is considered the top competitor for a controversial $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract (or at least was, pending a conflict-of-interest investigation). On top of that, Palantir uses Amazon Web Services, which also makes this contract an indirect win for the company aiming to do more Defense Department business.\\n\\nAt an event in San Francisco on Tuesday, a Pentagon adviser who previously helped launch and then managed Project Maven urged closer collaboration between Silicon Valley and the Defense Department.\\n\\n\"I think most here today would agree that militaries and their role in deterrence, offense and defense are part of world and will be for the foreseeable future,\" Brendan McCord, a special adviser to the Pentagon and, as of last month, president at the venture capital firm Tulco Labs, said at MIT Technology Review\\'s EmTech conference.\\n\\n\"But there are a multiplicity of views within the AI community on technology\\'s role in national security. One perspective is that armies of lawful democratic nations whose arsenals are set up for defensive purposes and protecting human rights and who are held accountable can promote peace and stability in the world. They require modern technology to do that in order to do that, technology such as AI.\"\\n\\nMcCord called for \"proactive engagement\" that, he said, would ultimately get more voices heard in national security decisions.\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear what that means, and McCord didn\\'t answer follow up questions. After they build and sell tech, what exactly will Silicon Valley voices contribute to the Pentagon?\\n\\nStill trying to find its own footing as the company walks a high tech tightrope forward, Google announced a new external advisory board at EmTech to advance the responsible use of artificial intelligence by the company.\\n\\nThe actual members of the board -- an already controversial group including the president of the right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation and the CEO of a drone company -- seem to have little idea about what comes next.\\n\\nJoanna Bryson, an academic leader in AI ethics and an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bath, is one of the eight-member council. In a conversation with Gizmodo, Bryson self-identified as a leftist compared to other council members and argued that Google engaging with the U.S. military could lead to positive outcomes.\\n\\n\"I am slightly worried that it\\'s too easy to walk out every time someone mentions the military,\" Bryson said. \"Of course, it\\'s also too easy to just trust everything the military says. We\\'re going to need to think harder.\"\\n\\nAll signs point to the 3,000-mile distance between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley shrinking significantly as the two places continue to work closely together. The question is will the Valley change the Pentagon, as people like McCord suggest it will, or is the relationship destined to be much more mathematical than all that?', 'source': {'uri': 'gizmodo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizmodo'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'patrick_howell_o_neill@gizmodo.com', 'name': \"Patrick Howell O'Neill\", 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--jN2c6jBk--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/rvuvwwtvumndotwxr3ve.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4688380', 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'wgt': 34}\n",

The president said that relocating illegal immigrants to these districts should make the \"Radical Left\" happy.\\n\\nHis comments came after The Post reported that the White House proposed sending the detainees to sanctuary cities twice in the last six months. The proposal was first floated in November amid reports of a large migrant caravan from Central America making its way to the southern border. The idea was again considered in February, amid the standoff with Congress over a border wall.\\n\\nThe Post said the plan was shot down both times, but last week, Trump signaled the proposal isn\\'t dead.\\n\\n\"Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,\" Trump tweeted last week. \"The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!\"\\n\\nTrump repeated the remarks later at the White House: \"We can give them an unlimited supply...let\\'s see if they have open arms.\"\\n\\nThe president doubled down as Democrats fumed over the relocation idea.\\n\\n\"The extent of this Administration\\'s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said in a statement Friday. \"Using human beings -- including little children -- as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal.\"\\n\\nShe added: \"The American people have resoundingly rejected this Administration\\'s toxic anti-immigrant policies, and Democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values.\"\\n\\nPELOSI FUMES OVER WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO RELEASE IMMIGRANT DETAINEES IN SANCTUARY CITIES\\n\\nPelosi\\'s district -- San Francisco -- was among the sanctuary cities to which the administration considered sending detainees.\\n\\nWhite House officials, though, stressed earlier Friday that the plan never went anywhere. A source familiar with discussions told Fox News that Democrats who advocate leniency toward illegal immigrants should work with the administration to find ways to transport those set for release, including in their states and districts.\\n\\nThe proposal was apparently rejected both times it came up by administration immigration agencies.\\n\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether immigration agencies would now support the proposal.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly blasted sanctuary cities, which are areas where local authorities refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agencies. The cities are typically run by Democrats.\\n\\nThe president was also hit last week with questions over the administration\\'s past family separation policy at the border.

Barbados', 'body': 'Four Bedrooms on the West Coast of Barbados$3.95 MILLION (7.9 MILLION BARBADIAN DOLLARS)\\n\\nThis four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath villa, called Atelier House, sits on half an acre in the parish of St. James, on the west coast of Barbados. The area, known as the Platinum Coast, is home to some of the Caribbean\\'s most expensive residences. This house, designed by Alistair Downie, a London architect, has been used for photo shoots and as a vacation rental, with prices starting at $1,500 a night.\\n\\n\"The interior design is phenomenal,\" said Walter Zephirin, the managing director of Seventh Heaven Properties, a luxury real estate agency based in Britain, which shares the listing with several other agencies.\\n\\nA walkway flanked by palms leads to the two-story villa, which was completed in 2012 and has an interior of about 4,300 square feet. (It encompasses 5,270 square feet when the covered outdoor spaces are included.) Double doors open to an entrance hall that connects the living and sleeping areas. On the left are the living room and an open kitchen, which has an adjoining chef\\'s kitchen.\\n\\nThe open kitchen has a Portuguese granite island and dining counter with hints of blue and green, selected to match the outdoor environment, said Amanda Snow, an interior designer and furniture designer who is selling the home with her husband, Sean O\\'Halloran, an artist who runs a digital strategy business. The living room has double-height ceilings and doors that open to the deck, the infinity pool and the outdoor lounging and dining areas. A half bathroom is near the kitchens.\\n\\nFrom the entrance, a hallway on the right leads to the bedrooms. One is en suite and two share a bathroom. The en suite master bedroom upstairs has wall-to-wall windows, a balcony and a covered private terrace. An ample sun deck overlooks the pool. A second staircase near the kitchens leads to an interior mezzanine, now a work space, and to the roof deck, Ms. Snow said.\\n\\nShe described the style as \"tropical modern\" with Brazilian influences. The trade winds, views and site all shaped the design, she said. The house is being sold furnished.\\n\\nThe nearest beach is a 10-minute walk downhill and 20 minutes back up, Ms. Snow said, or a three-minute drive. Near the house is a protected tropical gully with old mahogany trees, frogs and monkeys, she said. Restaurants and bars are about a 10-minute walk. Grantley Adams International Airport is about a 40-minute drive.\\n\\nMarket Overview\\n\\nBarbados\\'s residential real estate market slumped for about a decade following the global financial crisis, agents said. Today residential prices are somewhere between 20 and 30 percent lower than they were at their peak, though one agent said prices of some properties have fallen by as much as 40 percent. Prices may have hit bottom, agents said.\\n\\n\"The market is beginning to feel a bit better,\" said Hayden Hutton, the chief operating officer of Terra Caribbean, an agency with offices in Barbados and other countries in the region.\\n\\nMr. Zephirin said asking prices are more in tune with what buyers are willing to spend. \"That\\'s what\\'s bringing them back to the market,\" he said.\\n\\nIn a new report, Mr. Hutton wrote that last year\\'s market was \"mired in uncertainty,\" where oversupply and distressed sales were counterbalanced by increased confidence among potential buyers after last year\\'s general election, a landslide that returned the Barbados Labour Party to power.\\n\\nOverall, transaction volumes rose in 2018, compared with the year before. Mr. Hutton added that data is scarce, particularly in the luxury sector, defined in the report as properties in prime areas priced at $1 million and above. In that segment, the value of properties sold last year well exceeded agents\\' expectations, based on an informal survey.\\n\\nBarbados, an island nation with a population of close to 300,000, has attracted royalty, captains of industry and celebrities, said Chris Parra, the chief executive of One Caribbean Estates, the Christie\\'s affiliate in Barbados. Beachfront luxury villas start at around $10 million and reach $125 million for an ultraluxury home on the market now. And the highest-priced homes have maintained their value, he added.\\n\\nBeachfront condominiums and townhouses cost considerably less, he said. For example, a three-bedroom beachfront condo might cost $1.65 million, he said, and a four-bedroom townhouse might cost around $3 million.\\n\\nPrices inland are lower, said Suzanne Davis, the owner and chief executive of Luxe Caribbean Properties, a Barbados luxury agency. On the west coast, a two-bedroom townhouse in a gated community not on the beach might sell for $800,000. The southern end of the island is more affordable still, with comparable properties selling for $400,000 and up, she said.\\n\\nMr. Zephirin encouraged buyers not to overlook areas outside the coveted west coast. \"There are lovely pockets in the east coast and south coast,\" he said.\\n\\nWho Buys in Barbados\\n\\nTraditionally a destination for British and Canadian buyers, Barbados had more buyers coming from the United States in 2017 and 2018, Mr. Parra said.\\n\\nThe west coast draws more buyers from Britain and continental Europe, while the south attracts more from the United States and Canada, Ms. Davis said. Among her clients, about half are local and half are foreign.\\n\\nBuying Basics\\n\\nThere are no restrictions on foreign ownership of property in Barbados, but nonresidents must apply to the Exchange Control Authority at the Central Bank of Barbados for permission to buy and sell property, said Janielee Kelly, an attorney with Lex Caribbean, a law firm with offices in Barbados and elsewhere in the Caribbean. The process takes a week or two, and there is no charge.\\n\\nThe buyer and seller each typically retain an attorney, whose fee is between 1 percent and 2.5 percent of the sale price, plus a value-added tax of 17.5 percent.\\n\\nMs. Kelly said Barbados has a program for high-net-worth individuals and retired property owners who meet certain criteria: \"The Special Entry Permit program gives eligible non-nationals the freedom to live, work and retire in Barbados without having the hassle of frequent visits to the Immigration Department,\" she wrote in an email.\\n\\nProperties are often marketed in United States dollars, Ms. Davis said, and transactions are typically done in either United States or Barbadian dollars.\\n\\nWebsites\\n\\nBarbados Immigration Department: immigration.gov.bb\\n\\nBarbados tourism: visitbarbados.org\\n\\nBarbados Museum and Historical Society: barbmuse.org.bb\\n\\nBarbados National Trust: new.barbadosnationaltrust.org\\n\\nLanguage and Currency\\n\\nEnglish; Barbadian dollar (1 Barbadian dollar = $0.50)\\n\\nTaxes and Fees\\n\\nThe annual property tax, known as land tax in Barbados, is around $4,500 on this villa, Ms. Snow said.\\n\\nContact\\n\\nWalter Zephirin, Seventh Heaven Properties, 011-44-0-20-8960-1010; 7thheavenproperties.com\\n\\nFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

I felt unsafe and told him to just take it; $100 is not worth risking my safety.\\n\\nThat\\'s awful, how scary.\\n\\nYes. I thought, why is Craig\\'s List still a thing?\\n\\nHow did AptDeco, evolve from concept to actual company?\\n\\nIt happened very organically. When I moved back to New York, I brought a few pieces of furniture with me in a U-Haul truck. My co-founder [Kalam Dennis], we were friends, had been trying to sell his sofa on Craig\\'s List. He was really frustrated because people were low-balling him and not showing up when they said they would.\\n\\nHe asked if he could borrow my U-Haul truck, I still had a few hours before I had to return it. He posted, \"One day only, free delivery in New York City\" on Craig\\'s List. Someone contacted him immediately, came over, paid in full in cash, and he delivered it.\\n\\nThat was the \"aha\" moment. I had been thinking about the safety aspect of buying and selling furniture. For him, it was the frustration. So creating a safe place where buyers and sellers can communicate and transact -- not in cash, with furniture pick up and delivery -- became the premise for AptDeco. It hasn\\'t changed since.\\n\\nAt what point did you attend the accelerator Y Combinator in Silicon Valley? Did you learn anything new? I mean, you went Wharton.\\n\\nYes, it was the best decision. At the time, we had a product, probably less than 100 customers and some sales. What we didn\\'t know -- didn\\'t even know we needed to learn -- was getting our first 100, 200, 500 customers. We both had corporate backgrounds. They advised us to meet our customers.\\n\\nDid you? How?\\n\\nYes, we started by delivering the furniture ourselves. When we walked into their homes, we saw how they lived and why they were buying or selling. Most were going through a life event, having a baby, getting married. It was really fascinating, and it helped us from a marketing perspective.\\n\\nI also passed out flyers on the street. It was fun, but also very humbling. It\\'s like, I went to Wharton! I worked at Goldman Sachs! And now it\\'s February, it\\'s cold and I\\'m passing out flyers. [laughs]\\n\\nBusiness school doesn\\'t teach you to really get your hands dirty, roll up your sleeves, pass out flyers -- the practical nature of owning a business.\\n\\nDid you seek venture capital funding?\\n\\nYes, we\\'re series A, but we don\\'t really talk about how much we\\'ve raised.\\n\\nToday, a startup\\'s success is sized by how much capital they\\'ve raised versus how happy their customers are, how profitable, or not, they are, these are the real metrics for a business. Venture capital is a means to an end.\\n\\nI had raised money for non-profits, been to Wharton, through Y Combinator, we have a good network, but raising money has not been an easy journey. When you look at the data, funding for women is pretty nominal and funding for people of color is even worse.\\n\\nYour co-founder is American-born, you\\'re from Sudan, do you think that helps AptDeco?\\n\\nI think it does. I had not recognized the opportunity patterns in the U.S. that are based on race, gender, etc. I grew up in Sudan, in an environment where I am the [racial] majority. He\\'s African-American, he had to break down that piece of American culture. I thought, \"Well, it\\'s not going to stop me doing what I\\'m doing.\" I think I helped push some of those boundaries for him.\\n\\nHas being an immigrant from Sudan helped you as an entrepreneur?\\n\\nThe entire economy in Sudan is built on small businesses, there are no big corporations. So if you have to make ends meet, you essentially have to build your own small business. My father has his own firm, most of my aunts -- it\\'s very woman-friendly in terms of business -- have their own architecture or engineering firms. That\\'s how I grew up, and I think it\\'s influenced me more than I thought.\\n\\nWhat do you think about the current situation there?\\n\\nI\\'m excited. After 30 years of brutal dictatorship, the people of Sudan are optimistic about the future. Peaceful demonstrations have been taking place since December. I grew up hearing stories from my father about the role of university students leading demonstrations in the \\'50s and \\'60s; it\\'s great to see the youth leading this time around too. I wish I could be there!\\n\\nSome entrepreneurs I interview are very proud of being female, or a person of color, or an immigrant, but others don\\'t want to be labeled by race, gender or being foreign. What are your thoughts?\\n\\nI\\'m proud of all three, but I don\\'t think about it so much because I can\\'t control how someone who is sitting across the table from me sees my color or gender, \"Oh, well, she\\'s a woman and black.\" [dismissively] Well, that\\'s your stereotype and bias, and I can\\'t do anything about that. But I can focus on building my business, having great metrics, making sure all the customers are happy. Those are the things I can control, and then we\\'ll see what comes out of that.\\n\\nDoes representation of race, gender, being foreign-born, matter?\\n\\nAbsolutely! I happen to grow up in family of engineers, so I became one, it\\'s what I saw. But for someone who doesn\\'t have that, being able to see people on TV or out in the world like them, is very important. \"Oh, there\\'s a woman from Sudan who started a company in America. Wow, that\\'s cool, I guess I could do that too.\"\\n\\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed for clarity.', 'source': {'uri': 'observer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Observer'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'nina_roberts@observer.com', 'name': 'Nina Roberts', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/dsc_5173.b.jpg?quality=80&crop=119px%2C189px%2C4100px%2C2050px&resize=876%2C438&strip', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.08235294117647052, 'wgt': 27}\n",

Some say it\\'s dark tourism. And others refer to it as disaster tourism or danger tourism.\\n\\nFar-flung places like Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen may routinely hit headlines for their protracted wars and humanitarian disasters, though such locales are oft promoted as vacation destinations, catapulting the notion of \"adventure tourism\" into a whole new sphere.\\n\\nSuch a vacationing trend was on full display this month during the world\\'s largest travel trade show - ITB Berlin - at which hundreds of countries, tour operators, hotel chains and agencies from every region in the world endorsed destinations and experiences of every imaginable kind.\\n\\nTake Sudan: Despite the ongoing violence wreacking havoc on the country, bright and vivacious booths offered alluring portrayals of the wildlife, history, Red Sea, heritage and handicraft.\\n\\n\"Tourism plays two keys roles. First, it boosts Sudan\\'s good image to the outside world, reflecting the good nature of its people, its civilization, its popular heritage, and its arts,\" reads the embassy\\'s marketing on the nation\\'s tourism. \"Secondly, it contributes to the boosting of popular diplomacy of the country.\"\\n\\nAnd in the weeks leading up to the convention, ITB\\'s press releases boasted that Venezuela had \"doubled the size of its stand\" -- only the Latin American country, currently in the clutches of mammoth humanitarian, economic and political chaos, was a last-minute unexplained no-show.\\n\\nNonetheless, Venezuela remained as a must-visit destination on Latin America tour operators\\' promotional posters at the Berlin convention. Furthermore, it is still being publicized on sites such as Couchsurfing, with home-stays on offer.\\n\\nIN VENEZUELAN CRISIS, FAMILIES CAN\\'T EVEN AFFORD TO PROPERLY BURY THE DEAD\\n\\n\"Packed with colorful architecture and skirted by the mountains of the Venezuelan coast, Caracas is an exciting city that offers travelers much more than its reputation would suggest,\" the marketing materials read in regard to the now crumbling Venezuelan capital. \"This charming town is famous for its exotic flower crops and its delicious restaurants with spectacular views of the Caribbean Sea.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the U.S. State Department warns of scarce food or medical care, frequent power outages, anti-government protests in the street and excessive crime rates. There was also an exodus of almost four million since the nation\\'s economic woes kicked off almost four years ago.\\n\\nWhile much of the news coverage concerning Afghanistan is dominated by bloodshed and insurgency, its pockets of paradise are also plugged by some tour operators - such as Untamed Borders - who seek to give intrepid travelers a unique respite far outside the tried and true.\\n\\n\"To only describe what we do as guiding in unstable regions is a misrepresentation of what we do. In fact, one of the main reasons that people come on our trips and one of the things we work hard at, is to show the countries we guide in for the multi-faceted, complex places they are, rather than show them sweeping generalizations,\" explained James Willcox, founder of Untamed Borders, which specializes in travel to countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Middle East, East Africa, former Soviet Central Asia and the Caucasus and \"other off-the-beaten-track destinations.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, Untamed Borders ran 35 trips to Afghanistan -- including helping to organize the Marathon of Afghanistan, the nation\\'s only mixed-gender sporting event. They also completed their 9th Afghan ski season, guiding groups of skiers from the USA, Australia, the U.K., Canada, Russia and beyond, along with arranging the first ever commercial kayaking trip as well as \"cultural trips\" to places such as Kabul, Wakhan, Mazar and Herat.\\n\\nMany also come from far and wide to visit the lush Panjshir Valley, known for its quaint villages and endless mountains on the foothills of Hindu Kush.\\n\\nPAKISTAN WORKS TO CLEAN UP KARACHI, ONCE WORLD\\'S \\'MOST DANGEROUS CITY\\'\\n\\nMeanwhile, Syria\\'s Tourist Board - helmed by the Bashar al-Assad government - continues to encourage visitors to indulge in the country\\'s \"archeological and natural resources,\" its plethora of \"fine arts\" exhibits, and its beachside beauty, with hashtags such as \"Syria Always Beautiful\" and glossy videos of glamorous hotels and vibrant restaurants peppering through social media platforms.\\n\\nNonetheless, much of the country remains devastated amid almost eight years of war that prompted millions to flee their homes and claimed the lives of more than 500,000 people. There is no such mention of the battles on the Ministry of Tourism handouts.\\n\\nAnd even Yemen - which has been declared the worst humanitarian disaster in the world by the U.N and continues to be ravished by mass conflict between the Saudi-backed coalition and Iran-supported Houthi rebel fighters, along with another shadowy terror war given the control Al Qaeda amasses - is seemingly open for visitors.\\n\\nA tour operator from Easy Yemen Tours explained via email to Fox News that it remains possible to visit the Yemen mainland and its ancient Socotra Island. Tourist visas are approved by the immigration office within a five-to-seven-day period, and mainland tours last around five days with high-security permissions from the \"tourist police,\" tour organizers explained.\\n\\nARCHAEOLOGISTS FEAR BIBLICAL ARTIFACTS, MONUMENTS WON\\'T SURVIVE YEMEN WAR\\n\\nLibya too officially plugs its tourism as an industry, which is \"spreading on a vast area of the country.\" While it advertises its \"landmarks, fascinating landscapes, Mediterranean coast, and landscapes in the Sahara Desert,\" it does advise all visitors to \"read the travel advice made by their respective home countries before entering\" and \"arrange secure transportation before arrival.\"\\n\\nYet such skirting-on-danger-for-leisure purposes doesn\\'t come without controversy.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t encourage this type of tourism. Although we do get requests for travel to these destinations, we always return no availability responses,\" said Tim Hentschel, CEO of the online group booking specialty site Hotel Planner. \"We can\\'t book these tickets or hotels without risking violation of UN trade embargoes and travel insurance coverage. Also, travelers attempting this type of high-risk behavior not only put themselves at risk, but risk the lives of soldiers that have to help them if they are captured.\"\\n\\nIn recent times, Iraq too has poured resources into promoting \"religious tourism,\" especially in the Shia-dominant south, which bears the historic mosques of Najaf and Karbala.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia too, which has long relied only on religious tourism as home to the most important locations in the Islamic faiths, for the first time is preparing to open its doors to the curious outsider. In an unprecedented move, the kingdom is in the process of enabling tourist visas to be issued and loosening restrictions for foreign visitors including Americans - with such provisions as visa on arrival - expected to be implemented by the end of this year.\\n\\nIt\\'s all part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\\'s quest to diversify the economy and bolster the notoriously closed country\\'s international image.\\n\\nAnd according to one Mexican law enforcement official, the swell of attention on Mexican cartels in recent months as a consequence of both the migrant caravans and the El Chapo trial, has seen a mild uptick of outsiders rubbernecking into dangerous terrain.\\n\\n\"Cartels love the attention, and for the visitors, the danger levels aren\\'t what you would imagine,\" the official noted.\\n\\nAnd then there are the kinds of destinations that aren\\'t plagued by bombs and battlefields, but are heavily sanctioned by the U.S. government and pose grave security risks especially for U.S. citizens given the vulnerability to arbitrary arrests and hostile relations with host governments.\\n\\nFor one, Iran - feeling the heat following the return of hefty U.S. sanctions - has been busily encouraging foreigners to take advantage of its \"epic treasures.\" In last August, Tehran lawmakers voted to expand its Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization into a ministry of its own.\\n\\nINSIDE IRAN: WESTERN TOURISM A GROWING GOVERNMENT MONEY-MAKER\\n\\nAnd until the tragedy of Ohio native Otto Warmbier\\'s structured tour of North Korea, which ended with his devastating arrest and death in 2017, the hermit country was a hotspot for the daring.\\n\\n\"I was given the opportunity to run a half-marathon through the streets of Pyongyang in the spring of 2016. The cherry blossoms were all over the route, the beautiful landscape and architecture was breathtaking,\" recalled Los Angeles-based publicist Brian Gross. \"It\\'s very possible I was one of the few hundred Americans to have been in the country and it is an experience I will cherish.\"\\n\\nSince September 2017, however, U.S citizens are prohibited from visiting North Korea for tourist purposes.\\n\\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBut in the immediate years after wars and conflicts have died down, governments often depend on tourist revenue not only to bring back economies from the brink, but to capitalize on fostering a deeper understanding of the horrors that took place there not so long ago. Millions of tourists each year see the Killing Fields or the S-21 prison in Cambodia, haunting reminders of the late 1970s genocide of the Pol Pot regime, and the remnants of the Balkans, which was engulfed in bitter conflict throughout the \\'90s.\\n\\nBut the latest trend for those with deep pockets? Rwanda -- some 15 years after a horrific genocide left a million people dead.\\n\\n\"It costs a lot more than most other African countries to visit,\" explained one representative from the Visit Rwanda booth in Berlin, pointing out the luxurious elements, accommodation and picturesque lodges, safaris, valleys and villa that come with top-dollar prices far exceeding neighboring Uganda. \"But there is just something special about visiting Rwanda -- with all its history.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'hollie_mckay@foxnews.com', 'name': 'Hollie McKay', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/03/18/1024/512/694940094001_6015271420001_6015272421001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.02745098039215688, 'wgt': 26}\n",

Over the past two years, Russia collusion hysteria led politicians and analysts to cavalierly equate Russian election meddling to the Holocaust, the September 11 terrorist attacks, and the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.\\n\\n\"Putin\\'s Attack on the U.S. Is Our Pearl Harbor,\" proclaimed the headline to a Politico article, which went on to throw in a gratuitous comparison to September 11 for good measure.\\n\\n\"I would say that his performance today will live in infamy as much as the Pearl Harbor attack or Kristallnacht,\" said an MSNBC contributor, referring to Trump\\'s meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last year.\\n\\nSimilar comparisons were tweeted out by prominent analysts, historians, and politicians, including Senator Bob Menedez and Swalwell.\\n\\nSuch analogies cheapen not just the victims\\' memory but our national discourse.\\n\\nFirst, the exaggerations are unnecessary.

At best, calling the Russian election attack another September 11 betrays an insulting lack of perspective, akin to that of a bored teenager who claims sitting through algebra class is \"literally torture\".\\n\\nAvoiding gratuitous comparisons is especially important today, when we are witnessing widespread distortion of once-sacred tragedies. Last year, Poland was embroiled in a scandal over a law that whitewashed Polish involvement in the Holocaust. Similar campaigns are unfolding across Eastern Europe, where glorification of Nazi collaborators and SS units is rampant. Meanwhile, Russia is seeing a resurgence of the cult of Stalin, while in America, defenders of the Confederacy are exonerating slavery.\\n\\nOpinion | Stop Appropriating Atrocities To Talk About Russian Meddling\\n\\nThis climate calls for added vigilance and care in staying away from inappropriate analogies. Never Forget - whether applied to the Holocaust, Pearl Harbor, or September 11 - is not a passive concept. It extends beyond slapping on a bumper sticker or putting a black ribbon on a website. Never Forget is a call for the living to do what the dead cannot - guard their memory from appropriation, even if that appropriation is driven by justified outrage over an effort to influence an election.\\n\\nWe can do better in keeping that sacred duty.\\n\\nLev Golinkin is the author of \"A Backpack, a Bear, and Eight Crates of Vodka.\"\\n\\nThis story \"Stop Comparing Russian Election Meddling to Holocaust\" was written by Lev Golinkin.', 'source': {'uri': 'forward.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Forward'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jane_eisner@forward.com', 'name': 'Jane Eisner', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'peter_beinart@forward.com', 'name': 'Peter Beinart', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://images.forwardcdn.com/image/1090x480/center/images/cropped/putin-2-1553794269.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2627450980392156, 'wgt': 26}\n",

And as companies have stayed private for longer, executives have often delayed these big decisions. Now, with a spate of companies like Lyft, Uber and Pinterest poised to re-ignite the IPO market this year, private bankers say they're busier than ever.\\n\\nWealth advisers, many of whom have worked out of New York and San Francisco, say their conversations differ significantly in the Bay Area compared to the East Coast. The average founder is often younger than an East Coast client, which leads to different sets of concerns, including those around charity - some are keen to give, others couldn't care less - and family, because many don't have kids. Because they don't come from family money, clients may need a basic level of financial education. And half of one banker's clients are immigrants, some of whom do not plan to live in the US permanently, which leads to another set of considerations.\\n\\nBusiness Insider spoke with six private wealth advisors, from both traditional and independent firms, to understand what executives are doing - or should be doing - to prepare for these huge changes.\\n\\nTo be sure, these advisers have a vested interest in how the new-money executives prepare, since they're coordinating the plan of attack. And getting in with a future unicorn early can mean big business, not just with that client, but with the executive's network of peers and investors.\", 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'meghan_morris@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'Meghan Morris', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/51c1c33deab8eae25e000012-2732-1366.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2156862745098038, 'wgt': 25}\n",

I was intrigued by this and over the next year, whenever I had a free evening, I hung out near the dumpsters of Twitter and smaller tech companies, talking to trash pickers and the homeless.\\n\\nRecyclers came for the plentiful cardboard and cans, but I never found evidence that tech companies were throwing out particularly good food on a mass scale. In fact it was the contrary: I discovered nonprofit organizations -- like Replate, founded by a Syrian migrant who had studied at the University of California, Berkeley -- that collect uneaten food from tech companies and deliver it to homeless shelters and soup kitchens across the San Francisco Bay Area.\\n\\nBut my informal investigations got me interested in the world of trash picking and eventually led to my recent article about Jake Orta, an Air Force veteran turned full-time trash picker who lives three blocks from the well-fenced house of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder.\\n\\nTrash picking is nothing new in San Francisco. Generations have collected everything from furniture and appliances to lumber from the city\\'s sidewalks and dumpsters.\\n\\nBut these days garbage picking is juxtaposed with the extreme wealth that has pushed up housing costs in San Francisco to the point where a family of four earning less than $117,400 is eligible for low-income housing.\\n\\nI met many trash pickers over the past two years. Some were reluctant to give their names. Others moved away. I was introduced to Mr. Orta by Nick Marzano, an Australian photographer who documents trash picking in his nonprofit magazine, Mission Gold.\\n\\nTaciturn and mission-driven, Mr. Orta is a Texas native who in addition to serving in the military spent time as a cook, but fell into homelessness and substance abuse.\\n\\nDuring a particularly rainy San Francisco winter, Jim Wilson, our bureau photographer, and I wandered the slick streets of the Mission and the hills around Dolores Park with Mr. Orta as he scoured garbage bins for things he could sell.\\n\\nThere are parts of San Francisco, like Nob Hill and Pacific Heights, that have long been known for mansions and luxury hotels. Mr. Orta\\'s neighborhood is in full-blown transition, an uneasy blend of crumbling tenements and freshly painted restored Victorian homes; grocery shops catering to the Latino working class and boutiques selling \"small-batch chocolates,\" designer sunglasses and fine leather shoes.\\n\\nIn the early evening, when Mr. Orta begins his rounds, Wi-Fi-equipped buses swing around tight corners, ready to disgorge tech workers from Silicon Valley.\\n\\nIn a city where nearly everything can be done with an app, Mr. Orta does not have a phone. So coordinating with him was difficult. We set a time to meet at his apartment and hoped he would be there. Often he was not.\\n\\nWhen his beloved Dallas Cowboys lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs in January, Mr. Orta could not be roused from his small studio apartment.\\n\\nHe is not a class warrior, nor is he particularly opinionated about politics or income inequality. He was not aware he was searching the bins of Mr. Zuckerberg\\'s house until we told him who owned the place.\\n\\nAnd I found him to be ambivalent about trash picking, which he has been doing full time for six years. On some days he described it as an addiction. He was excited about what he might find on his treks through the city.\\n\\nOn other days he said his dream was to go back into the food business.\\n\\n\"I want to get a food truck and make Texas-style brisket,\" he told me one night as he pulled a suitcase with a missing wheel that he had just retrieved from a garbage bin.\\n\\n\"This,\" he said looking back at the suitcase, \"is not my ultimate goal.\"\\n\\nRelated CoverageIn San Francisco, Making a Living From Your Billionaire Neighbor\\'s TrashApril 7, 2019\\n\\nFollow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'thomas_fuller@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Thomas Fuller', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/insider/09insider-trash-image1/09insider-trash-image1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4711596', 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'wgt': 23}\n",

From now on, all our resources will be devoted to improving and growing our website.\\n\\nAlthough we\\'re very optimistic about the future of the Forverts online -- especially since we\\'re continually attracting new visitors to our videos and articles -- it\\'s obviously hard to say good-by to a print newspaper that\\'s been around for 122 years, longer than any other Yiddish publication. Since 1897, the Forverts broadsheet served as a source of news and Yiddish culture for Yiddish speakers of all stripes: immigrants and American-born, secular and traditional, workers, professionals and retirees.\\n\\nSince I joined the Forverts staff in 1998, many people, even those who didn\\'t know any Yiddish, would tell me about how their parents or grandparents would send them to the store to buy the Forverts, or how they learned to decipher Yiddish words using Forverts issues that were lying around at home.\\n\\nAs a nod to these precious memories, we asked our readers to send us their favorite anecdotes about the Forverts over the years, all of which were published in our last print issue. Some of them have already appeared online as well, in both Yiddish and English, including one in which a reader explains how a photo of his brother Motl appeared in the Forverts on the day the family reached America\\'s shores, and another one about a certain penny-pinching Forverts reader.\\n\\nWe also published memoirs by former Forverts editor Boris Sandler, veteran Forverts writers Miriam Hoffman Itzik Gottesman and Yoel Matveyev, Isaac Bashevis Singer\\'s longtime assistant Devorah Telushkin and devoted readers Marc Caplan and Mikhl Yashinsky.\\n\\nI myself have very few childhood memories of the Forverts, since my parents subscribed to its rival paper, Der Tog-Morgn Zhurnal. But to be honest, I wasn\\'t much interested in either paper. Although I was raised in a Yiddish-speaking home by Yiddishist parents, I -- like most young American girls -- had little interest in the Jewish culture of Eastern Europe, which had been practically decimated by the Holocaust. It wasn\\'t until I began reading world literature in college -- works by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Dickens and Sartre -- that I became deeply interested in the literature and history of my own people. It was then that I understood the importance of reading Yiddish books and periodicals as a way of maintaining our language and culture, despite the forces of assimilation and materialism hovering close by.\\n\\nThis week, at the seder, we\\'ll read the Biblical story of Exodus, about God\\'s freeing of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The haggadah tells us that as the Israelites prepared to flee Egypt, they had no time for the dough to rise, so all they could take with them was unleavened bread. In the Bible we read something else: When the Israelites heard that Pharaoh had finally freed them from bondage, they immediately gathered all the gold and silver that the Egyptians had given them. Understandably, the Israelites were concerned with their future and wanted to ensure that they could bring along material possessions to sustain them.\\n\\nMoses had something very different in mind. Recalling Joseph\\'s request that the Israelites bring his remains to Canaan once they ;eft Egypt, Moses devoted himself to this task even before packing his own possessions. In contrast to the people who thought only of material wealth and property, Moses emphasized the honoring of his forefathers.\\n\\nThis passage has a message for us as well. The Forverts is eagerly entering its new phase as a digital-only publication; we can all agree that this is the most pragmatic solution going forward. But at the same time, we must never forget the huge contributions of previous generations of editors, writers and typesetters that diligently served the diverse Yiddish-speaking readership in America for over 120 years and helped make the Forverts what it is today.\\n\\nThis story \"Approaching Passover, The Forverts Print Edition Closes\" was written by Rukhl Schaechter.', 'source': {'uri': 'forward.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Forward'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'rukhl_schaechter@forward.com', 'name': 'Rukhl Schaechter', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://images.forwardcdn.com/image/1090x480/center/images/cropped/rukhl-kahan-1555356729.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2705882352941176, 'wgt': 22}\n",

Department of Homeland Security lawyers quickly rejected the proposal, according to the people, and it was dropped.\\n\\nBut not, apparently, by the president, who revived the idea in his tweets.\\n\\nThe plan, which was first reported by the Washington Post, is one of many ideas considered by an increasingly frustrated White House in recent months as President Donald Trump has railed against the growing number of Central American migrant families crossing the southern border. Officials say they are running out of options, and have proposed and recycled numerous ideas that have never come to fruition. Trump in recent weeks has discussed the idea of renewing his administration\\'s controversial family separation policy. And he and aides are weighing forcing asylum-seeking families to choose between being detained together as their cases make their way through the courts or sending their children to government-run shelters.\\n\\nRELATED: ICE arrests more than 280 at Texas business, largest workplace immigration raid in a decade\\n\\nThere were at least two versions of the sanctuary city plan that were considered, according to one of the people familiar with the effort. One would have moved people who had already been detailed and were being held elsewhere to places with Democratic opponents of the president, while the other would have transported migrants apprehended at the border directly to San Francisco, New York City, Chicago and other spots.\\n\\nRevelation of the idea drew immediate condemnation on Friday from Pelosi and other Democrats.\\n\\nThe No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, criticized the idea of using ICE or any other federal agency \"to penalize\" or \"for political reasons.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the act of a democratic government,\" he said.\\n\\nAnd Rep. Bennie Thompson, D- Mississippi, who chairs the House Homeland Security committee, said: \"The fact that this idea was even considered - not once but twice - serves as a reminder that the Trump Administration\\'s reckless immigration agenda is not about keeping the country safe, but about partisan politics and wantonly inflicting cruelty. \"\\n\\nA Homeland Security spokesperson played down the reported idea, saying it was \"floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion.\" A White House official echoed that language.\\n\\nFormer ICE Deputy Director Matt Albence, who on Friday was announced as the agency\\'s acting director, denied that the White House pressured immigration officials to implement the idea.\\n\\n\"I was asked my opinion and provided it, and my advice was heeded,\" he said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said this week that it had started scouting vacant properties that could be turned into facilities for holding migrant children in several cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, and San Antonio.\\n\\nThose facilities would be licensed by each state and likely take several months to be approved and opened, separating them from the rapidly-expanding emergency shelter at Homestead, Florida, and the now-closed tent facility at Tornillo, Texas.\\n\\nThe Defense Department has also been reviewing a number of military bases to find a location that can house up to 5,000 unaccompanied migrant children as the U.S. braces for a surge of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border this spring. Health and Human Services submitted the request for space last month, as Homeland Security leaders warned that tens of thousands of families were crossing the border each month. HHS has traditionally been responsible for providing temporary shelter to unaccompanied migrant children crossing the border.\\n\\nICE is tasked with arresting people living in the country illegally - including some who have been here for decades. Under the Trump administration, ICE has significantly stepped up arrests, including of people who have no U.S. criminal records.\\n\\nIn response, some cities have banished ICE from jails where agents could easily pick up immigration violators. Police in New York, Baltimore and Seattle rarely, if ever, disclose information about when suspected criminals in the U.S. illegally will be released from custody.\\n\\nDuring his tenure at the Justice Department, Trump\\'s former Attorney General Jeff Sessions went after sanctuary cities, threatening to cut off their federal funding.\\n\\nICE arrested 32,977 people accused of crimes and 20,464 for immigration violations during the budget year 2018.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have also said they will deport Sorokin, whose visa expired in 2017, once her sentence is over.\\n\\n\"I am stunned by the depth of the defendant\\'s deception,\" Judge Diane Kiesel said at the Manhattan state court sentencing hearing.\\n\\nSorokin\\'s case garnered national attention after New York Magazine and Vanity Fair published exposes on the lengths the 28-year-old allegedly went to in order to convince close friends, banks, and financial institutions she was a foreign heiress with unlimited funds so she could get them to finance her international vacations, shopping habit, and lodging at expensive boutique hotels.\\n\\nIn reality, she was the daughter of a Russian truck driver who arrived in the U.S. in 2016.\\n\\nManhattan prosecutors argued during the three-week trial in Manhattan Supreme Court that Sorokin told \"lie after lie\" to maintain the lavish lifestyle she couldn\\'t afford, falsely telling friends and businesses she had inherited a $67 million fortune from her father, whom she claimed was a diplomat or an oil baron. They also alleged she falsified bank records and forged identification to further the scam. During a 10-month spree, Sorokin allegedly defrauded financial institutions and Manhattan\\'s elite out of $275,000.\\n\\n\"She knew if she told people she had this money, they would trust her, that eventually she would be good for the deal,\" Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Catherine McCaw said in her closing arguments in April. \"In fact, she had no ability to pay and no intention to pay.\"\\n\\nHer ruse began to unravel after she allegedly promised a friend an all-expenses paid trip to Morocco, then stuck her with the $62,000 bill. Sorokin was arrested in October 2017 and charged with grand larceny and theft of services.\\n\\nDuring her trial, Sorokin declined to take the stand on her behalf, and her attorney did not put on a defense, but argued in his closing statement that Sorokin was just living by the old adage \"fake it till you make it,\" like New York musician legend Frank Sinatra.\\n\\n\"Sinatra made a brand-new start of it in New York, just as Miss Sorokin did,\" her lawyer, Todd Spodek, told jurors in court on Tuesday, adding she \"was ambitious, she was persistent and she was determined to make her business a reality.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'thedailybeast.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Beast'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'pilar_melendez@thedailybeast.com', 'name': 'Pilar Melendez', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1903,w_3383,x_0,y_16/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1557423873/GettyImages-1136286905_gv5nf1', 'eventUri': 'eng-4776840', 'sentiment': 0.08235294117647052, 'wgt': 22}\n",

Shredded an elbow. Couldn\\'t just pick up the pro game after a beastly performance in college. Maybe just had bad luck.\\n\\nOne of the more interesting misses is Chad Mottola.\\n\\nThe Cincinnati Reds expended their first-round pick of the 1992 draft on Mottola. Mottola was number five in the draft behind Phil Nevin, Paul Shuey, BJ Wallace and Jeffrey Hammonds. Nevin and Hammonds made all-star teams. Shuey played in the majors for 13 seasons. Wallace, drafted by the Montreal Expos, never made it to the show.\\n\\nBut who came before Cincinnati chose Mottola in 1992 is not nearly as intriguing as who followed Mottola.

But everyone knows Derek Jeter.\\n\\nThe New York Yankees took Jeter with the sixth pick in the \\'96 draft.\\n\\nThe rest is history.\\n\\nTRUMP CALLS ON PARTIES TO \\'COME TOGETHER\\' AFTER \\'COSTLY & TIME CONSUMING INVESTIGATIONS\\'\\n\\nWe\\'ve heard about an \"infrastructure bill\" for years in Congress.\\n\\nIt\\'s been down in the minors. Big promise. Lots of upside. A \"five-tool player.\" But it\\'s never made it to the show. That\\'s why it\\'s so fascinating that President Trump and top congressional leaders may be game to move an infrastructure package soon. There\\'s hope it will serve as the bipartisan, political salve for the political divides.\\n\\nThe president talked about it before he took office. Democrats were hopeful the president would pivot to infrastructure. It never happened.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t long until \"infrastructure week\" devolved into a bad joke on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nBoth sides were quickly mired in fights over various cabinet secretaries. A battle over two Supreme Court justices - culminating in the imbroglio over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Three government shutdowns. Endless encounters over a border wall, DACA and immigration. Arguments over health care. Scrapes over the Russian investigation, the Mueller report, inquests about documents and general distrust.\\n\\nNow nearly two dozen Democrats are vying to defeat the president next year.\\n\\nPresident Trump hosted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., at the White House this week to discuss a bipartisan infrastructure package. There is supposedly an accord to spend $2 trillion on fixing roads, bridges, highways and updating the nation\\'s transportation system - though few know how they\\'ll pay for it.\\n\\nIt\\'s notable that Schumer declared that there was \"goodwill in this meeting and it was different than some of the other meetings, we\\'ve had - which is a very good thing.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ll see how long this all lasts.\\n\\nRemember, they have to deal later this summer with raising the debt ceiling and avoiding a fourth government shutdown in October. We haven\\'t even talked about Congress approving one of the Trump administration\\'s marquee items: a new trade pact with Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). And one wonders if any modicum of trust will erode as Democrats dig deeper into avenues revealed in the Mueller report.\\n\\nKeep in mind that a bipartisan win looks good for Trump going into 2020. Pelosi knows that she needs to give freshman Democrats several big wins between now and the election. So the sides could be ready to deal - and it may all come down to timing.\\n\\nThe key to an infrastructure deal could hinge on noise-canceling headphones. The sides will have to ignore the din over the Mueller report -- which ordinarily would threaten to torpedo the infrastructure deal -- and actually bring a potential measure to completion.\\n\\nThe 2020 election could also work against the sides. It\\'s unclear how long everyone has before they retreat to their corners and let politics reign.\\n\\nHistory is not on anyone\\'s side.\\n\\nCongress really hasn\\'t addressed infrastructure in any form since the 2009 economic stimulus bill. Democrats passed the measure in an effort to right the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Republicans opposed the package. They argued the plan spent too much and that many programs in the bill weren\\'t truly targeted toward infrastructure.\\n\\nInfrastructure seems like it should be bipartisan. But it\\'s a far cry from that.\\n\\nDemocrats may attempt to push for environmental and labor interests in the pact. That could doom cooperation from many Republicans.\\n\\nREPORTER\\'S NOTEBOOK: HOW CONGRESS COULD BE FACING NOT ONE, BUT TWO SHUTDOWNS\\n\\nAnd no one really knows if they can trust Trump. Lawmakers of both parties are used hearing one thing from the president, another line from his staff, thinking they have an agreement in principle, and then watching it all melt away. Consider two separate experiences last year when it came to funding the government - as well as a 2017 episode when the president undercut GOP leaders in front of Pelosi and Schumer.\\n\\nWe haven\\'t even addressed a likely fight over the federal gas tax which is used to help pay for roadways, via the Highway Trust Fund. Motorists currently pay a tax of 18.4 cents per gallon. Lawmakers last raised the gas tax in 1993. Washington has never indexed the tax for inflation. Thus, people are paying mid-1990s tax rates for gasoline. Various proposals to amend, update or hike the gas tax in an effort to spur infrastructure development have failed.\\n\\nPelosi had an additional talk with Trump about an infrastructure bill after the Tuesday meeting.\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to be putting together what some of the acceptable pay-fors are to him,\" said Pelosi.\\n\\nEven a middling infrastructure bill would be a blow - since policymakers have pushed a major investment in infrastructure for so long.\\n\\nIf they can\\'t work this out, the infrastructure bill will likely linger longer in the minors. Bumpy road trips between Midland and Tulsa. Mobile and Chattanooga.\\n\\nIt might have a cup of coffee with the big club. But we\\'ve seen that before.\\n\\nIt was \"infrastructure week\" in Washington. But until Congress actually puts a measure on Trump\\'s desk to sign, the bill is merely a prospect, toiling in AA or AAA.', 'source': {'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'chad_pergram@foxnews.com', 'name': 'Chad Pergram', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/30/1024/512/694940094001_6031647916001_6031634545001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'eventUri': 'eng-4767089', 'sentiment': -0.04313725490196074, 'wgt': 22}\n",

It\\'s politically polarizing and complex. It\\'s a human drama unfolding every day. President Trump is right to sound the alarm about destitute migrants illegally crossing the border only, for many, to be permanently ensnared by our taxpayer-funded social welfare complex.\\n\\nHowever, the key to the president\\'s re-election and his greatest potential for a lasting legacy isn\\'t a border wall or immigration reform. It is embracing a bold plan to deal with another real threat to America\\'s long-term economic vitality - our infrastructure crisis.\\n\\nTrump will doubtlessly haggle with Congress and take a beating from the media every day on immigration between now and his last day in office. That\\'s why it would be a significant tactical mistake to allow the Trump presidency to be defined almost exclusively by the border fight.\\n\\nTRUMP LAID OUT AN INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY FOR GROWTH - LET\\'s GET MOVING AND UNITE AROUND IT\\n\\nA full-throated focus on infrastructure now makes both economic and political sense. It\\'s a natural fit for a president with a background as a builder, developer and businessman. It also would serve to solidify support among traditional Democratic constituencies such as union workers.\\n\\nNew Yorkers remember well the photos of a younger Donald Trump wearing a hard hat at construction projects from the Wollman Rink to the Grand Hyatt to Trump Tower and more. Truly impactful presidents focus from a policy standpoint on their natural strengths. For President Obama, the community organizer, health care was a natural fit. For President George H.W. Bush, the diplomat and intelligence chief, it was foreign policy. History is replete with similar examples.\\n\\nFor Trump, taking on the role of master builder makes sense.\\n\\nAmerica\\'s infrastructure, once a symbol of our economic dominance and national resiliency, is crumbling. The great bridges, dams, airports, tunnels and roads of America were each longer, higher and more advanced than the next. They were once icons of American innovation. Americans were proud of these concrete and steel veins and arteries that connected us. They were the envy of the world.\\n\\nOur infrastructure was overbuilt and overengineered, anticipating the nation\\'s growth and expansion. It was built to enhance our national security and personal safety.\\n\\nWhen President Eisenhower commissioned the interstate highway system in the 1950s, he put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work for four decades building nearly 50,000 miles of roads. The system expanded the average Americans\\' reach across the country. The Hoover Dam was built in anticipation of massive growth in population and electricity needs.\\n\\nBuilding with an eye on the future has now given way to a Band-Aid approach that only manages decline. As spending on federal social welfare programs has nearly doubled to more than $1 trillion annually since the late 1960s (accounting for inflation), federal investments in transportation and water infrastructure today amount to less than $100 billion per year.\\n\\nInfrastructure needs are widespread and impact virtually every American regardless of geography.\\n\\nThe tunnels under the Hudson River are a vital artery for Amtrak\\'s Northeast Corridor, which serves more than 800,000 people per day. They are nearly a century old and the proposed Gateway Project to replace them and enhance rail infrastructure will cost more than $20 billion.\\n\\nAccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, more than 60,000 bridges are considered structurally deficient nationwide. One out of every five miles of road across the nation is in need of repair. A 2017 report of the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that roads will need a $2 trillion in investment over the next decade. The organization gave the United States a D+ rating in 2017 for the state of our infrastructure.\\n\\nAn infrastructure moon shot might sound cliché, but it would boost job creation numbers by an order of magnitude, elicit cheers from trade unions and help maintain the existing momentum among Latino voters\\n\\nSince President Trump took office, 590,000 construction jobs have been created nationwide, according to the Department of Labor. For a range of reasons, the White House isn\\'t getting credit for those jobs or even a strong economy.\\n\\nAn infrastructure moon shot might sound cliché, but it would boost job creation numbers by an order of magnitude, elicit cheers from trade unions and help maintain the existing momentum among Latino voters who, in a recent Marist poll, showed a double-digit jump in support for the president.\\n\\nInfrastructure is a national effort that can serve to bring both sides of the political spectrum together or be used to expose leftist Democrats for fighting Trump at any cost.\\n\\nThis is where the president has a real opportunity to lead. It is understandable that he\\'s not inclined to do any favors for blue state Democrats such as New York\\'s Gov. Andrew Cuomo or Sen. Chuck Schumer, or Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy. But rebuilding crumbling infrastructure is the best way to maintain economic growth in those states.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nWith economists projecting a slowdown or even recession on the horizon, proposing historic investment in our infrastructure this year will put Democrats on the defensive over job creation and prime the pump to protect against economic forecasts.\\n\\nThe president is a builder. \"Building the wall\" is fine, but most Americans are still waiting for him to rebuild America.

Comprehensive Health Services also operates three shelters for unaccompanied migrant children in Texas.\\n\\nHere\\'s what you need to know about Caliburn International:\\n\\nCaliburn International is the parent company of Comprehensive Health Services, which operates the country\\'s largest detention center for unaccompanied migrant children. That detention center, Homestead, has been described as a \"prison camp\" by its critics, according to an NPR report.\\n\\nNPR reported that, when Homestead opened its doors to journalists, the journalists saw a disciplined, orderly center where children were kept to strict rules but were also given birthday celebrations, space to play soccer, and ice cream as a reward for good behavior. But NPR also spoke to lawyers who said the children in the camp were \"traumatized\" and were not even allowed to hug each other.\\n\\n\"We see a very different picture,\" Leecia Welch, the senior director of legal advocacy and child welfare at the National Center for Youth Law, told NPR. \"We see extremely traumatized children, some of whom sit across from us and can\\'t stop crying over what they\\'re experiencing. We hear stories of children who are told from the first day of their orientation that under no circumstances can they touch another child in the facility, even their own sibling, even friends who they\\'re saying goodbye to after many months of shared intense experience. They can\\'t hug them goodbye. If they do, they\\'re told they will be written up and it could affect their immigration case.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, Caliburn International announced that it was planning to go public. The company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and announced its plans to go public. As part of its announcement, Caliburn International said that the Trump administration\\'s \"border enforcement and immigration policy ... is driving significant growth.\" But Caliburn International also warned potential investors that its role in migration detention could be a liability, writing that the \"challenging and politically charged environment\" could \"adversely impact our share price.\"\\n\\nCaliburn International is a military contracting conglomerate. It\\'s the parent company of Sallyport Global Services, a military contractor which operates military bases in the Middle East and Asia. Sallyport operates Balad Air Base, an Iraqi base funded by the US government and located in Baghdad.\\n\\nIn February, the Daily Beast reported that the US Department of Justice was investigating Sallyport Global Services over charges that the company was involved in allegedly bribing Iraqi government officials in return for exclusive contracts. The Daily Beast also reported that Sallyport may have ties to a Kuwaiti company called Afaq which, the site said, allegedly sold access and dictated terms for a number of American military contracts.\\n\\nIn October 2018, Caliburn International announced plans to become a publicly-traded company. The company said that it planned to sell $100 million in shares. But in March, Caliburn announced that it was canceling its plans to go public.\\n\\nThe company did not explain why it had decided not to go public. The announcement came just after the Daily Beast published two reports by the Government Accountability Project on Caliburn and its subsidiaries. Those reports described allegations that Sallyport Global, a military contractor owned by Caliburn, allowed out animal abuse, racism, and theft on the Balad air force base in Iraq. The reports also described a federal investigation into whether bribes were paid to a company that was allegedly linked to former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki in exchange for a contract to manage a base in Iraq.\\n\\nJohn Kelly joined the Trump administration as White House chief of staff in January 2017. Before that, Kelly had been a member of the board of directors of DC Capital Partners.

She previously worked in media relations for Femsa, a multinational company with businesses in the beverage, beer, and retail industries. She covers Amazon, immigration, trade, Europe and New York startups. You can reach her at mgonzalez@inc.com.\\n\\nRaising capital usually is a months-long process. Toronto-based alternative lender Clearbanc promises to make you an offer in 20 minutes.\\n\\nOn March 3, Clearbanc introduced its \"20-min Term Sheet,\" which offers e-commerce startups based in North America anywhere from $10,000 to $10 million in minutes without signing over any equity. Clearbanc instead takes a portion of startups\\' top-line revenue.\\n\\nWhile the model isn\\'t entirely new, co-founder and president Michele Romanow says entrepreneurs have long-needed more options between taking venture capital and taking debt. Romanow, who\\'s also an an investor on Canada\\'s version of Shark Tank, Dragons\\' Den, says Clearbanc gives founders a shot at growing while still retaining ownership of their companies.\\n\\n\"Founders are using the most expensive form of capital\" to grow, she says, quoting the 2018 annual letter from Social Capital, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm founded by early Facebook employee turned investor Chamath Palihapitiya. According to him, VC-backed startups spend nearly 40 cents of every VC-dollar on Facebook and Google ads. Plus, thanks to inherent biases in the industry, even if you want to raise venture capital you might not get it--only 2.2 percent of all VC dollars go to women, Romanow notes. Clearbanc can solve both problems, she argues: it\\'s less expensive capital and it has nothing to do with your investor connections. \"Because we\\'re using digital data, we\\'ve actually taken the bias out of decision-making,\" she claims.\\n\\nAs opposed to a loan product, Clearbanc advances do not have a repayment timeline, and the interest rate does not compound over time. Once you receive the funds, Clearbanc will take five percent of your company\\'s top-line monthly revenue until its advance is repaid. It will add a 6 to 12.5 percent fee on top, which will vary depending on how you spend the funds. For example, if you use the money to buy ads from its approved vendor list, which includes Facebook, Google, Amazon, Pinterest, and Twitter, Clearbanc will only charge you a 6 percent fee. If you use the money for something else, say buying a new office computer, the fee could go up to 12.5 percent, which is more than what you might pay for a Small Business Administration-backed loan.\\n\\nIf your company, which must have at least six months of consistent revenue history to qualify, can\\'t meet future revenue expectations, Clearbanc walks away with nothing. The focus, Romanow says, is on e-commerce startups because the nature of their revenue is repeatable.\\n\\nReceiving a term sheet does not automatically mean you\\'ve been approved for the funds. You must go through a due diligence process where you give Clearbanc access to your payment processor (Stripe, Square, Amazon, etc.) and connect both your bank account and your advertising data to its platform. On average, that process takes between five and seven days, the company says, though once that\\'s done Clearbanc can dispatch the funds in a day.\\n\\nWhat Clearbanc is doing is not necessarily new, says Bill Phelan, co-founder and president of PayNet, a small business-credit rating company based in Skokie, Illinois. Clearbanc\\'s model falls under what is known in the industry as merchant cash advances, which offer money to companies in exchange for a slice of their revenue, albeit with a twist. Competitors include fellow Canadian startup Corl, which is based in Montreal and Seattle-based Lighter Capital.\\n\\n\"I think where this is innovative is in financing an intangible activity like marketing,\" he says, noting that most lenders will require some security in the form of collateral. \"In this case, if the advertising doesn\\'t work out, what does the lender have?\"\\n\\nRomanow, who co-founded the company in 2015 with Andrew D\\'Souza, says she is clear-eyed about the risks. As a founder who bootstrapped three of her previous companies--and raised more than $120 million in venture funding for Clearbanc--she is convinced that the offering will entice many entrepreneurs.

Wyatt Detention Facility, voted to temporarily end a contract to house detainees on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The decision Friday came after leaders of the city -- where more than half of the 19,000 residents are Hispanic -- passed a resolution denouncing the prison and its overseers after it started housing immigrants at the facility.\\n\\nThe fight highlights the tensions within local governments over the Trump administration\\'s aggressive approach to detaining those who crossed the border illegally, which led Atlanta\\'s mayor last year to stop the city from holding ICE detainees. In Central Falls, the city\\'s move has also prompted push-back from a trustee for bondholders, which said it\\'s considering legal options to protect the revenue stream that backs their investment.\\n\\n\"Our responsibility is first and foremost to the corporation -- we have a fiduciary responsibility to the corporation,\" said Joseph Molina Flynn, the chair of the corporation, whose members are appointed by the mayor. He said the board voted to suspend the ICE contract after hearing about \"human rights issues,\" such as the facility not providing detainees with access to interpreters and legal representatives.\\n\\nCentral Falls\\' Wyatt Detention Facility has struggled financially over the years and has long been controversial. It was the site of what the American Civil Liberties Union called \"sadistic\" behavior toward one inmate, who died in 2008 at the jail and prompted ICE to pull its inmates from the facility that year. In March, the detention facility began housing over 130 detainees for ICE, according to a filing. About $98 million in debt issued by the corporation is still outstanding and in default, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\nLast week, Central Falls city council members passed resolutions saying \"there is no need\" for the corporation and voiced support for shutting down the detention facility, which also holds other federal inmates. That earned the city leaders a rebuke from the trustee for bondholders, UMB Bank, which said it hired law firm Mintz Levin to review legal options, according to a regulatory filing this month.\\n\\nMintz Levin said that holding immigrant detainees is part of an attempt to raise revenue and become economically viable, according to a March letter to the city\\'s solicitor. Last week, it warned that calls to close the detention center and the push to invalidate the ICE contract impair the rights of bondholders and could open the city up to \"significant\" damages. Moving to close the jail would break an agreement with bondholders and be in \"direct violation\" of state law, the April 2 letter says.\\n\\nRelated: Shutdown Pain Hits Local Jails That House Federal Inmates\\n\\n\"Should the mayor\\'s threats materialize, the city and state\\'s reputation in the municipal finance market would be negatively affected, including likely rating downgrades,\" the letter says.

Top economists and policy makers have proposed a number of explanations for the economic slowdown, but in the end, there\\'s no consensus on the reasons, on how long the slowdown will likely last, or on what to do about it.\\n\\nEconomic growth has two main components: Productivity growth and the growth of the labor force. One potential theory for our stagnant economic growth is demographics, namely, the rapidly declining population and labor force growth around the world.\\n\\nThe current world\\'s population is 7.7 billion. The UN Population Division estimates that global population will reach 9.8 billion with a growth rate of 0.5% in 2050, and will peak around 2100 at roughly 11.2 billion with a growth rate of 0.1%. Other projections estimate that the population will grow slower, peak at 9.4 billion around 2070 and then decline to around 9 billion in 2100. Some project that after reaching a peak of 9 billion, the world\\'s population will decline back to today\\'s levels by 2100.\\n\\nJapan and a few other countries are already experiencing population declines. The U.S. population is currently around 330 million, and is projected to reach 390 million in 2050 and 450 million in 2100. While the U.S. birthrate hit a historic low in 2017, the population has continued to grow due to immigration. The U.S. growth rate is 0.71% including immigration and 0.43% without.\\n\\nThe global labor force grew at an average of 1.8% per year between 1960 and 2005, but since then it\\'s been growing at just 1.1% per year. The labor force is still growing in some developing countries like India, Nigeria and the Philippines, but it\\'s already shrinking in China, Japan and Germany. In the U.S., the labor force is growing very slowly, 0.5% per year over the past decade, compared with 1.7% from 1960 to 2005. Given the continuing decline in fertility rates in most parts of the world, the global labor force is expected to slip further in the coming decades.\\n\\n\"The rapid aging of the population of both developed economies and much of the rest of the world ... is seen as one of the most dangerous economic ills of the next several decades,\" wrote economic professors Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo in a 2017 paper. Older populations not only reduce labor force participation, but also lead to lower productivity, given that workers\\' productivity and earnings have been shown to peak in their 40s. One might thus expect that countries undergoing faster aging would be most affected by slower economic growth and GDP per capita. But, in fact, this is not the case. \"If anything, countries experiencing more rapid aging have grown more in recent decades... The lack of a strong negative association between changes in age structure and changes in GDP per capita is surprising. So what explains it?\"\\n\\nIn Demographics and Automation, published in March, 2019, Mssrs. Acemoglu and Restrepo analyzed the impact of an aging labor force on economic growth and automation based on a simple model of technology adoption and innovation. Workers were classified into two age groups: middle-aged--those between the ages of 21 and 55--and older--those 56 and higher. These workers were allocated across different tasks and industries. The model assumed that middle-aged workers have a comparative advantage in physically oriented production tasks while older workers specialize in non-production services.\\n\\n\"In our model technology is endogenous: firms can invest resources to automate and substitute machines for labor in production tasks, and will have stronger incentives to automate when the middle-aged wage is greater,\" noted the authors. \"Using this framework, we show that demographic changes that reduce the ratio of middle-aged to older workers induce the adoption of additional automation technologies.\"\\n\\nLet me briefly summarize their key findings and predictions.\\n\\nFirst, the model predicts that an aging workforce leads to greater automation, especially in production oriented industries that rely more on middle-aged workers and whose tasks are more amenable to automation by robots and related technologies. An analysis of data from various sources verifies these predictions. The more rapid the aging of a country\\'s population, the greater their use and development of industrial robots and automation to make up for the relative scarcity of middle-age workers.\\n\\nCountries that experience more rapid aging-- e.g. Japan, Germany, South Korea-- are also the ones at the forefront of adopting industrial robots. South Korea has 20.1 industrial robots per thousand workers, Germany has 17.0 and Japan 14.2. The U.S. lags behind at 9.1 industrial robots per thousand workers. Part of the reason is that the U.S., and to some degree the UK, are not aging as rapidly as South Korea, Germany and Japan. Germany has deployed industrial robots at almost twice the rate of the U.S. If the U.S. had the same demographic trends as Germany, the paper predicts that the gap would be 25% smaller.\\n\\nMssrs. Acemoglu and Restrepo also investigated whether demographic pressures have an impact not just in the use of robots and other automation technologies, but on the actual development of robots, other industrial automation technologies and patents. In all cases, the analysis showed statistically significant correlations. For example, Germany and Japan each have six major producers of industrial robots, while the U.S., which is aging less rapidly, has only one.\\n\\nBeyond robots, the analysis found a strong effect of aging in countries with the highest shares of exports of industrial automation technologies. To verify the accuracy of their findings, the authors analyzed whether there were positive correlations between aging and the exports of technologies not related to industrial automation. They found no such correlations. They performed a similar analysis with patents related to industrial automation, and once more found a significant correlation between aging and the number of such patents, but no correlations between aging and patents not related to industrial automation.\\n\\nFinally, Mssrs. Acemoglu and Restrepo analyzed the relationship between an aging labor force and productivity as measured by the value added per worker. In general, the productivity implications of aging are ambiguous. \"On the one hand, demographic change might reduce the number of high-productivity middle-aged workers relative to lower-productivity older workers. On the other hand, demographic change might increase productivity because of the technology adoption it induces.\" While the main effect of aging on productivity is ambiguous, \"in the presence of demographic change, industries with the greatest opportunities for automation are experiencing more rapid growth of productivity and greater declines in labor share relative to other industries.\"\\n\\nIn their concluding paragraph, the authors remind us that while their research has been focused on production tasks in manufacturing, a much broader set of tasks across a wide variety of industries are now open to automation, given the continuing advances in AI and other technologies. Much research remains to be done on the relationship between aging populations, economic growth and automation.\\n\\nIrving Wladawsky-Berger worked at IBM for 37 years and has been a strategic advisor to Citigroup, HBO and Mastercard.

Here's Why.\", 'body': '[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\\n\\nNew York is moving closer than ever to introducing congestion with the news on Monday that state lawmakers supported a plan to charge drivers a fee to enter Manhattan\\'s busiest neighboroods.\\n\\nCongestion pricing has practically become a household term. Transit advocates, business leaders and others have rallied around it, saying it is the best option for raising money to fix New York City\\'s broken subways.\\n\\nGov Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, revived congestion pricing in New York in August 2017, declaring it \"an idea whose time has come\" -- prematurely as it turned out. Many state legislators disagreed, especially from the boroughs and suburbs outside Manhattan where drivers say it is unfair when they do not have easy access to transit. Though the state budget contained congestion fees on taxis and Ubers, it left out the more ambitious congestion pricing plan.\\n\\nNow congestion pricing is on the verge of becoming reality. Here\\'s why.\\n\\n\\'A real push\\' from the governor\\n\\nThough Mr. Cuomo, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways and buses, supported congestion pricing last year, many legislators and advocates say he did not push hard enough. This year, the governor\\'s words and actions have escalated.\\n\\nHe has increasingly cited the necessity of congestion pricing and recently made his most forceful argument yet, warning that if state lawmakers did not approve it -- subway riders could pay the price with a 30 percent subway fare increase.\\n\\nHe has included the congestion zone -- the centerpiece of a congestion pricing plan -- in his budget proposal unlike last year when he did not.\\n\\nAnd when a lawsuit by the taxi industry temporarily blocked the congestion fees on taxis and Ubers from starting January 1, his administration vigorously fought back. The fees have since gone into effect, though the lawsuit continues.\\n\\nThe governor is banking on congestion pricing to generate $15 billion for repairs and improvements to the transit system through 2024.\\n\\n\"He has been steadfast and that\\'s been key,\" said Charles Komanoff, a policy analyst and longtime congestion pricing advocate. \"Last year, it was more of a trial balloon. This time, it feels like a real push.\"\\n\\nHow would congestion pricing work?\\n\\nThe governor has called for a congestion zone in Manhattan south of 60th Street. Those who use already-tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to enter Manhattan would receive a credit. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not have to pay.\\n\\nA panel of experts would set the fees that drivers would have to pay by 2020. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, also known as M.T.A. bridges and tunnels, would collect the fees under the governor\\'s proposal.\\n\\nThe fees could vary by the type of vehicle, the time and day of the week and other factors, but that would be negotiated with state legislators. The governor has also proposed creating a so-called \"lockbox\" for revenue raised through congestion pricing to ensure that it can only be spent on capital projects for the transit agency.\\n\\nUnder a similar plan put forward by a state task force last year, drivers could have been charged $11.52 for passenger cars and $25.34 for trucks.\\n\\nCongestion pricing experts expect something along those lines. \"The skeleton of the plan has been presented several times now,\" said Sam Schwartz, a consultant who helped develop last year\\'s plan.\\n\\nThe transit authority recently started searching for a consultant to help develop this year\\'s plan, indicating that it was moving forward quickly.\\n\\nPatrick Muncie, a spokesman for the governor, said \"the pricing structure will be determined after discussions with the Legislature and once all variables are analyzed to meet the goals of the plan.\"\\n\\nTransit officials getting on board\\n\\nMr. Cuomo is not the only one making more of an effort. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials have been meeting privately with state legislators and other elected officials to address transit issues in their districts -- and offer improvements -- to build trust and support for additional funding. They are expected to meet soon with Bronx officials to discuss plans for expanding Metro-North Railroad services.\\n\\n\"They\\'re on a listening tour of the Albany legislature,\" said Kathryn Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a top business group. \"We can\\'t sell congestion pricing without it.\\n\\nLast year, Ms. Wylde said, many legislators were unwilling to approve more money for the transit authority when they felt that their local transit services were already neglected and their concerns ignored.\\n\\n\"Legislators need a reason when they raise fares and tolls,\" she said. \"They were looking for a story line they could tell and the M.T.A. was not offering up anything.\"\\n\\nTransit officials have started to lay out detailed plans about how the money would be spent on repairs and capital improvements. That has helped reassure some elected officials that any new money would not be squandered, according to advocates.\\n\\nAndy Byford, who took charge of the subways and buses last year, has also been on his own listening tour holding a series of town hall meetings around the city.\\n\\nBetter odds in Albany\\n\\nThe Republican-controlled State Senate showed no interest last year in passing congestion pricing. Senate Republican leaders, most of whom were from outside the city, were not open to imposing any additional financial obligations on New Yorkers.\\n\\nEven Democratic Assembly leaders had been unwilling to take on such a divisive issue, especially in an election year. While Speaker Carl E. Heastie, who represents the Bronx, supports congestion pricing, he told his members that he would not exert his will on them.\\n\\nBut congestion pricing\\'s odds improved this year, supporters say, following the blue wave that helped flip the State Senate, giving Democrats control of state government for the first time in a decade. Many new members are young and take subways and buses or ride bikes rather than drive cars. They do not need to be sold on congestion pricing\\'s benefits.\\n\\nVocal supporters from outside Manhattan include Senators Alessandra Biaggi in the Bronx, Julia Salazar in Brooklyn, and Jessica Ramos of Queens, a borough where there has long been resistance to driver fees.\\n\\n\"We need a clear congestion pricing plan that will ensure the revenue brought in is allocated directly to improving issues with our subways,\" Senator Ramos said. \"The state legislature knows that straphangers do not have any more time to waste waiting for these repairs to be made.\"\\n\\nWinning over the \\'windshield view\\'\\n\\nAs congestion pricing has become intertwined with the subway, it is gaining wider support, advocates say.\\n\\nOne of the biggest changes, Mr. Schwartz says, has been in the \"windshield view\" -- as drivers fed up with being stuck in gridlock want something done. Traffic in Midtown Manhattan now crawls at an average of 4.7 miles an hour as Ubers and other ride-app cars have flooded streets, truck deliveries have expanded and construction has blocked or narrowed car lanes.\\n\\nThis year, there is not one but two grass-roots campaigns working to pass congestion pricing. Fix Our Transit grew out of last year\\'s effort and includes more than 125 organizations, including leading business, labor and civic groups.\\n\\nA second coalition, #FixtheSubway, is coordinated by the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders, and includes neighborhood-based social justice, labor and immigrant organizations.\\n\\n\"What kind of progressive government doesn\\'t deliver for transit riders stuck on the subway and bus every day?\" said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance.\\n\\nFew other options\\n\\nCongestion pricing still faces many hurdles. Opponents, including Assemblyman David I. Weprin of Queens, have vowed to continue fighting. And even some supporters have raised concerns about the lack of details in the governor\\'s plan, while others have questioned whether it gives the state too much authority over city streets.\\n\\n\"I am excited to see the momentum behind it this year, but we simply can\\'t afford to get it wrong,\" said City Council Speaker Corey Johnson. \"Any plan that runs on city money, takes control of the city\\'s streets and sidewalks while ignoring city priorities, is the wrong plan.\"\\n\\nBut the bottom line is that there may be no other choice as transit problems have gotten so bad that Albany leaders have to do something.\\n\\nMr. Komanoff said there was a readiness to try something new and different as familiar ideas to reduce congestion (enforcing traffic rules) and raise money for transportation (taxing commuters) have languished.\\n\\n\"Congestion pricing has come to be seen as the fundamental building block to fix our streets and subways,\" he said. \"Everything else will revolve around it.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'winnie_hu@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Winnie Hu', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/nyregion/19congestionpricing/merlin_132788196_22f826cc-6893-4ba4-9dd5-a2c67f8b3c24-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4683959', 'sentiment': 0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 18}\n",

Simply put, we need more women, young people and ethnocultural minority advisers and support staff.\\n\\nAt the same time, these same groups represent chronically underserved segments of the financial advice market, offering advisers an opportunity to forge new relationships and grow their businesses. These dual and largely overlapping initiatives create an opportunity for the industry to leverage M&A to both increase diversity and enter new markets.\\n\\nTo be sure, advisers can (and should) hire from a diverse pool of candidates when it makes sense. However, acquiring practices that already serve diverse groups, often while having key personnel on staff who are members of those groups themselves, may be the most efficient way to enter those markets -- especially for advisers seeking to expand in major metropolitan areas.\\n\\nMost big cities have a high number of ethnic and cultural minority households that at once have significant wealth but no relationship with a professional adviser. The industry should recognize the value and long-term potential of such would-be clients.\\n\\n(More: Financial literacy could make advice more accessible to women of color)\\n\\nThere's no question, however, that practices that mirror society will have an easier time capitalizing on this opportunity, since prospects from immigrant families or those who speak a different language often feel more comfortable with teams with similar backgrounds.\\n\\nIf a client or prospect, for instance, prefers to speak Spanish, having a multi-lingual adviser or someone else on staff who can facilitate a conversation may help to uncover needs that probably would not have been revealed otherwise. There are countless other examples where being armed with an understanding of the sometimes-subtle nuances between cultures can be relevant when delivering advice, especially during major life events such as marriage.\\n\\nAlong with life-expectancy factors that make it more likely for wives to outlive their husbands, the rise of households with female breadwinners means financial advisers have an incentive to create women-friendly practices. One way to pursue this goal is to seek out M&A deals with women-led groups or, at the very least, with groups that have a healthy mix of male and female advisers.\\n\\nWhen merging practices with this purpose in mind, male advisers ought to make it a priority to learn from their new female colleagues. What prospecting and client communication best practices have worked well for them? Which types of women are they most successful in serving, and why is that the case?\\n\\nRather than looking at women-focused M&A deals through a purely transactional lens, male advisers will enhance their overall value proposition by genuinely collaborating with the women advisers they bring into the fold -- which means men also should be open to sharing the secrets of their success.\\n\\n(More: What a man can learn by attending a women's financial conference)\\n\\nMost top advisers are either baby boomers or come from Generation X. To a considerable degree, most clients do too.\\n\\nBut as millennials approach their prime earning years, practices must get younger. This generation -- which grew up in the Internet era and came of age at a time when everyone carries a smartphone in their pocket -- is typically more comfortable communicating via text or through social media platforms.\\n\\nThe idea of physically coming into an office for a meeting multiple times a year will be foreign to them. Because of this, they will likely seek out an adviser whose client communication model reflects this generational difference. Moreover, such a client will naturally want to work with someone whose career arc mirrors their own, versus an adviser who is counting the days until his or her retirement.\\n\\nAge-based strategic M&A (i.e., pairing practices comprised of older advisers with ones in which there is a higher level of diversity) can help the broader industry stay in tune with the preferences of the next generation of investors while helping many longtime veterans transition out more gradually.\\n\\nAt a time when so many practices look the same, creating a diverse team will not only aid advisers in their efforts to stand out from peers but the broader independent advice industry to move forward by growing into underserved markets. Mergers and acquisitions can ignite that process.\", 'source': {'uri': 'investmentnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'InvestmentNews'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'alex_chalekian@investmentnews.com', 'name': 'Alex Chalekian', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.investmentnews.com/storyimage/CI/20190419/FREE/190419926/AR/0/AR-190419926.jpg&cci_ts=20190419111641', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.3725490196078431, 'wgt': 17}\n",

Not only did the terrifying ordeal end with heavily armed Maltese special forces storming the ship at dawn Thursday, but the act will almost surely guarantee that no civilian ship is going to go anywhere near a sinking migrant boat from this point forward.\\n\\nThe migrant rescue started out as a standard Mediterranean exercise that is by now very familiar in the heavily trafficked shipping lanes between the coasts of Libya and Europe. A rubber dinghy crammed with mostly Sub-Saharan men, women and children was taking on water off the coast of Libya after smugglers sent the boat out. The distress call was picked up by Alarm Phone, a non-governmental organization that acts as a liaison between sinking migrants and coast guard and navy authorities in Libya, Italy and Spain.\\n\\nThere were 108 people on the sinking boat, the distress caller said, among them 19 women and 12 children. The Libyan Coast guard cryptically responded that it was \"out of service\" so Alarm Phone put out a general SOS call to the nearest mercantile ship in the area. The Turkish crew of the El Hibru 1 responded in accordance with the 1910 maritime law that governs the seas, which states quite clearly: \"Every master is bound, so far as he can do so without serious danger to his vessel, her crew and passengers, to render assistance to everybody, even though an enemy, found at sea in danger of being lost.\"\\n\\nThen things went wrong for everyone. The Libyan Coast Guard finally answered the phone and told the Turks to turn around the bring the migrants back to Libya, which offered closest port although far from the safest.\\n\\nJust five of the unarmed migrants revolted and overcame the authorities,according to a Maltese Armed Forces spokesman, who made it sound like a scene from the movie Captain Philips about Somali pirates off the west African coast. But the crew told reporters in Malta after they docked that all of the migrants protested being returned to Libya, with many of them threatening to jump overboard if the ship went back. Many of whom would have likely been in Libyan detention centers for months or even years. Recent reports by UNHCR, Doctors Without Borders and the International Organization for Migration indicate that all migrants now spend time in both official and unofficial detention centers in Libya, which are equally accused of human rights violations.\\n\\n\"The captain repeatedly stated that he was not in control of the vessel and that he and his crew were being forced and threatened by a number of migrants to proceed to Malta,\" the spokesman told The Daily Beast. \"The ship crew had no choice but to comply.\"\\n\\nThe ship then set sail for Malta, bypassing the Italian island of Lampedusa after Italy\\'s anti-immigrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini threatened military action against the shlip should it come within Italy\\'s waters. \"These are not migrants in distress, they are pirates,\" Salvini quipped on social media, telling them not to even think about docking on the tiny island.\\n\\n\"You will only see Italy through a telescope.\"\\n\\nAt dawn, the Turkish tanker reached Maltese waters where it was met by heavily armed tactical anti-terrorism forces who boarded the ship and wrested it back from the migrants, who were unarmed. The ship was escorted with helicopters with snipers to the military port in the Maltese capital Valletta, where it was met by paddy wagons ready to take the hijackers to jail. When the ship entered the port just before 9 a.m. Thursday morning, camouflage-uniformed officers with heavy weaponry were standing guard over crouched migrants who looked like they didn\\'t have much fight-or food-in them.\\n\\nOnly five migrants-all men -- were taken into custody and named by Maltese officials as the masterminds of the somewhat bizarre ordeal. The remaining 103 were deemed true asylum seekers and will be processed in accordance with the so-called Dublin Act that mandates that they apply for asylum in the European country where they first set foot.\\n\\nSalvini fumed in a tirade on social media, posting that they are \"criminals\" and should all be taken straight back to Libya. Never mind that a recent report shows that the conditions in Libyan detention centers deteriorated to beyond inhumane. A March 2019 report by the humanitarian group Women\\'s Refugee Commission claims that sex abuse is among the most common forms of torture for both men and women who travel through Libya. So much so, that the report quotes a source who has worked with those who have gone through the centers. \"Everyone knows when a man says, \\'I\\'ve gone through Libya,\\' it is a euphemism for rape,\" the report states. \"100 percent of women migrants [traveling the central Mediterranean route] experience sexual violence ... [while] 98 percent of men and boys coming from Sahel and through Libya are exposed to sexual violence.\"\\n\\nThe high jacking happened one day after the European Union announced that its own border control program Sophia, which has rescued upwards of 10,000 people in recent years, would be docking its cutters and only conducting air patrols to try to scout for migrant boats trying to make the crossing. It remains unclear who they will call if they see one or who might even answer such a call if they are at risk of getting caught up in what is a political battle. Most mercantile ships turn off their transponders altogether when crossing through the waters where migrants are most frequently found, according to Marine Traffic. It is common to have a sea full of ships with none on the radar.\\n\\n\"We must look to these 108 people with an eye of humanity and understand that any actions taken yesterday were in self-defense against the deadly consequences forced upon them by Europe\\'s inhumane border policy,\" Johannes Bayer, chairman of the German rescue boat Sea-WAtch, which is one of the last-remaining NGO rescue boats at sea. \"It is entirely legitimate for people found in distress at sea to reject being returned to Libya, the very place they know they will only continue to suffer the gravest of violations of their rights and the most degrading treatment.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'thedailybeast.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Beast'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'barbie_latza_nadeau@thedailybeast.com', 'name': 'Barbie Latza Nadeau', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1553788760/190328-barbie-tanker-hijack-tease_ssr0rf', 'eventUri': 'eng-4688278', 'sentiment': -0.003921568627450966, 'wgt': 16}\n",

The levels of activity and emotion poured out over such a short span of time can be outright insane.\\n\\nFrom the players, coaches and other participants\\' side of the schedule, they\\'re pushing themselves to potentially - hopefully - double their normal court time. Instead of playing about four games per month, the winners average out to two a week.\\n\\nThat\\'s intense enough all by itself. There\\'s no physical downtime for those gents. That light switch has to stay on.\\n\\nGetting in the Game\\n\\nThen there\\'s the feel of being in March Madness. It\\'s electric on top of being exhausting. Each one of these young men know they have to be on their A-game out there. They know what\\'s at stake.\\n\\nWhich makes it even more \"mad\" for them from start to finish.\\n\\nAs for us - the spectators and sports enthusiasts - we\\'re not even going to pretend there\\'s a comparison between being on one of the participating teams and watching the participating teams. There\\'s obviously not.\\n\\nWhile they experience each physically, mentally and emotionally involved play right there in real time, we get to lounge in our comfy couches and La-Z Boy recliners while we yell at the TV. Sure, we might feel the pressure to beat our colleagues and buddies to win whatever collective pot is being set aside. However, it\\'s not really the same thing no matter what diehard fans we might be - and we know it.\\n\\nWe know it, yet there is still some pressure sitting in the spectators\\' seats, what with fitting in all that increased TV time, creating our brackets, monitoring our brackets and (hopefully) bragging about our brackets.\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s not exhausting, but it is time-consuming. That\\'s for sure.\\n\\nAnd yeah, there\\'s still that electricity going on that we can\\'t help but feel.\\n\\nPhoto Source\\n\\nThe Sweet 16 Field\\n\\nAs you no doubt know by now, March is on its way out and March Madness is steadily progressing as well. So far, we\\'ve made it through the First Four match-ups, as well as the full first and second rounds to narrow the field from that initial 68 teams to a mere Sweet 16.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re rooting for your highly favored alma mater or your school of choice is more of a Cinderella story, the action is only intensifying as the tournament progresses. There haven\\'t been any actual upsets so far, but there have certainly been a few close ones, including with the often-favored Duke blue devils.\\n\\nUSA Today described the Blue Devils as having merely \"survived\" their last bout against the University of Central Florida, adding in how \"even coach Mike Krzyzewski acknowledged his team should\\'ve lost.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s what happens when a well-coached team like UCF plays with urgency and forces Duke to shoot outside... Sunday\\'s near-upset showed how beatable Duke is, and it makes the Blue Devils\\' title chances suddenly feel far more difficult.\\n\\nOf course, don\\'t count them out of the competition quite yet. Don\\'t count any of the remaining teams out. You\\'d better believe there\\'s still a whole lot of possibility left on the court for all 16 of them when they\\'ve made it this far.\\n\\nSo what will happen and how it will happen is anyone\\'s guess.

At the end of 2018, American Campus\\'s portfolio of 204 owned and third-party managed properties, with approximately 133,900 beds, enjoyed its 14th consecutive year of same store growth in rental rate, rental revenue, and NOI. In 2019 ACC expects to see an acceleration in same-store NOI growth driven by both higher revenue and lower operating expense growth relative to 2018. The company\\'s debt to enterprise value (as of Q4-18) was 34.6%, debt to total asset value was 36.5% and the net debt to run rate EBITDA was 6.3x. Despite the uncertainty within the macro economy, fundamentals in the Student Housing Industry remain healthy and the stability of business model will continue to make Student Housing one of the most sought-after investments globally.

BPY owns, operates and develops one of the largest portfolios of office, retail, multifamily, industrial, hospitality, triple net lease, self-storage, student housing, and manufactured housing assets. Their core portfolio includes 142 office properties totaling 96 million square feet in the world\\'s premier cities; and 124 Class A+ malls across 121 million square feet in the U.S. Last year, office SSNOI (Same-Store Net Operating Income) grew 5.3%, with 94% occupancy; retail sales were $746 per square foot, up 5.8% from the prior year. BPY aims to generate annual returns on equity of 12%-15%, based on stable cash flows and asset appreciation; along with annual distribution growth of 5%-8%.

The company\\'s mission-critical facilities protect and ensure continued IT infrastructure operation for approximately 1,000 customers - including over 205 Fortune 1000 companies. CONE\\'s strong balance sheet, helped by S&P\\'s credit upgrade last September, provides significant financial flexibility and capacity to fund growth: with no near-term debt maturities, debt fully unsecured, and liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. For 2019, CyrusOne expects to invest $400 million of the capex budget into EU and U.K. projects, so the company can become competitive with other powerhouse data players - such as Digital Realty (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX). In Q4-18, normalized FFO (funds from operations) per share of 86 cents beat the estimate of 82 cents, while revenue of $221.3 million missed the consensus $223.5 million. And while the 2019 FFO per share guidance fell short of the consensus estimate, I\\'m convinced CyrusOne has set the stage for growth in 2020 and beyond, with outsized potential to generate returns in the high double-digits. Shares now trade at $51.70 with a dividend yield of 3.6%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on CONE.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nEasterly Government Properties (DEA) is an office REIT acquiring, developing, and managing class A commercial properties leased to U.S. government agencies, whose critical missions don\\'t go out of favor - including the FBI and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Easterly is the only internally managed \"pure play\" government-leased REIT, benefiting from America\\'s top credit ratings & stable outlook (S&P, Moody\\'s, Fitch, DBRS), and the fact the U.S. government is the largest employer in the world - and largest office tenant in the country. Easterly\\'s 65 properties encompass 5.6 million square feet, and are 99% leased. Q4-18 FFO per share (adjusted, fully diluted) was $0.29; full year $1.03. Until December 2017, Easterly was growing its dividend, modestly, but opted to freeze growth in 2018 - likely due to the payout ratio exceeding 100% AFFO; analysts expect dividend growth to resume in 2020. Even with that elevated payout ratio, I\\'m encouraged by the enhanced price appreciation potential, with forecasts of approximately 5% growth, the company\\'s continued diversification efforts, and knowing senior DEA management owns approximately 14% of shares, providing strong alignment of interest with shareholders. Shares trade at $17.98 with a dividend yield of 5.8%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on DEA.

The Company\\'s 48 hotels, totaling 7,644 rooms, are in New York, Washington, DC, Boston, Philadelphia, South Florida and select markets on the West Coast. In 2018, net loss on common shares was -$14.2 million or -$0.38 per diluted common share, compared to 2017\\'s net income of $75.7 million, or $1.79 per diluted common share. The 2018 decrease was primarily due to a decline in gains on dispositions of hotel assets. Also last year, the company completed an asset recycling campaign, allocating nearly $90 million to reposition and renovate many of their legacy hotels to support long-term growth potential - with the vast majority of the operationally disruptive projects completed by Q4-18, which allowed the earnings potential of the portfolio, to continue into 2019. Q4-18 revenue per available room (RevPAR) at 37 comparable hotels increased 2.8% to $189.82, with the average daily rate (ADR) for the comparable set increasing 3.2% to $233.21, and occupancy down 27 basis points to 81.4%.

HTA\\'s investments are targeted to build critical mass in 20 to 25 leading gateway markets that generally have leading university and medical institutions, which translate to superior demographics, high-quality graduates, intellectual talent and job growth. Strategic markets HTA invests in support a strong, long-term demand for quality medical office space. In 2018, the company lowered leverage and increased liquidity, selling over $300 million of non-core assets, using the majority of capital to repay over mortgage debt, reduce leverage (5.4x net debt to EBITDA) and maintain over $125 million cash on the balance sheet. Over the next three to five years HTA believes it has a steady and dependable earnings model; and we think investors can expect total returns in the high double-digits over the next twelve months.

The highly diversified business model, tallies 80% of profits from Storage, 20% from Services - through information management, digital transformation, secure storage, secure destruction, data centers, cloud services and art storage and logistics... to over 225,000 customers worldwide. Iron Mountain\\'s \"core\" business is Records & Information Management (45% of revenue), along with Secure Shredding (10.1%), Data Management (8.7%), and Data Centers (5.8%). IRM\\'s real estate network totals more than 90 million square feet, across more than 1,450 facilities, in approximately 50 countries. Operations drive the value of the company, passing increases onto customers and decreasing any impacts of rising interest rates. Iron Mountain has only 2% customer turnover in a given year - meaning 50% of the boxes stored 15 years ago still remain. The company also has higher leverage than most peers: the lease adjusted leverage ratio at the end of 2018 was 5.6x. Also in 2018, Iron Mountain generated 16% AFFO growth, which helped reduce the dividend payout ratio to 78%. We believe IRM could generate above-average returns in 2019 - in the high double digits. Shares trade at $35.17 with a dividend yield of 6.9%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a BUY on IRM.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nKimco Realty (KIM) is a REIT I consider: \"dirt cheap.\" Not bad for one of North America\\'s largest publicly traded owners and operators of open-air shopping centers. The company has 437 properties across 76 million square feet of leasable space, primarily in the top 20 U.S. markets, which provide 80% of ABR (annualized base rent). Those markets project a population growth of 6.3 million within the next five years. Q4 2018 and year-end earnings results were solid, including 2018 pro-rata occupancy of 95.8%. In 2018, Kimco completed several development and redevelopment projects, including its first large-scale Signature Series mixed-use development - and exceeded goals for dispositions. Kimco\\'s balance sheet is in excellent shape, ending 2018 with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 6x. Total consolidated debt stands at $4.87 billion (~$605 million lower than 2017), and no debt maturities in 2019. Liquidity is excellent with over $2.1 Billion in availability from the revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Key \"success\" elements of the company\\'s business model for the years to come: portfolio quality and location, many sources of untapped value creation embedded in the portfolio, and balance sheet strength and security. Future development will be a key growth driver as current projects are completed, and the pipeline with carefully selected redevelopment opportunities sell out. We expect Kimco to deliver strong double digit returns in 2019 and 2020 (so far in 2019 shares have returned 28.5%). Shares trade at $18.15 with a dividend yield of 6.2%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on KIM.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nKite Realty Group (KRG) is another shipping center REIT that should deliver promising alpha. As of year-end, the company owned interests in 111 operating and redevelopment neighborhood and community retail properties in 19 states, totaling approximately 22.0 million square feet (plus a 0.5 million sf development project under construction), overall at 94.6% occupancy. The largest 25 tenants include TJ Maxx, Publix, Bed Bath & Beyond, and PetSmart, were about a third of Kite\\'s total 2018 ABR, with no single retail tenant more than 2.6%. Three state locations (Florida, Indiana and Texas) counted just over half of the 2018 ABR - which hit a company high of $16.84 per square foot. Kite has a strong investment-grade balance sheet with ample liquidity and a well-staggered maturity schedule - capacity on its line of credit alone could satisfy all debt maturities through 2022. And the company has announced plans to sell $350-500 million of non-core assets, to improve portfolio quality, reduce leverage, and focus on preferred geographic markets. Shares trade at $15.50 with a dividend yield of 8.2%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on KRG.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nLTC Properties (LTC) is a health care REIT that invests in Seniors Housing (about 48%) and Skilled Nursing properties (about 49%) primarily through sale-leasebacks, mortgage financing, joint-ventures and structured finance solutions, including preferred equity and mezzanine lending. LTC holds more than 200 investments in 28 states with 28 operating partners. Q4-18 FFO was $32.1 million, up from $30.4 million in Q4-17. (FFO per diluted common share was $0.81 and $0.77 for the respective fourth quarters.) Excluding $3.1 million in non-recurring income in the 2018 period, FFO decreased $1.4 million - compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 - due to non-payment of December rent by partner Senior Care, as a result of their Texas bankruptcy filing. The majority of LTC\\'s assets are concentrated in Texas (17.5%), followed by Michigan (14.8%), and Wisconsin (8.6%). I do have several concerns - and while the company pays dividends monthly, it didn\\'t grow its dividend in 2018. And while I was surprised by the Senior Care bankruptcy, I was glad LTC had the upper hand, and put Senior Care in default. I also appreciate the company maintains leverage - as a must - and as the cycle improves, I believe LTC investors will be rewarded for the company\\'s strict discipline. Shares trade at $45.52 with a dividend yield of 5.0% (paid monthly).\\n\\nWe are maintaining a BUY on LTC.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nMid America (MAA) is a Tennessee corporation focused on providing a high-quality apartment living experience to residents across the Sunbelt region of the US.

After two years of merger activities MAA the platform appears stable and stronger than ever. Shares trade at $108.49 with a dividend yield of 3.5%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a BUY on MAA.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nMonmouth Real Estate (MNR) is an industrial REIT that operates a property portfolio that consists of 113 industrial properties, representing approximately 21.8 million square feet. The geographically diversified portfolio is from coast to coast across 30 states with a focus on major seaports, major intermodal ports, and major airports. Monmouth\\'s exposure with FedEx is highly concentrated, with over 59.6% of annual rent and 48 % of square footage leased to the logistical giant. Monmouth shares have been trading poorly because of weaker demand (related to FedEx) and pressure on operating margins (of FedEx). Monmouth has newer buildings with 80% of rental revenue derived from long-term leases to investment grade tenants, the company has historically had very high tenant retention rates, averaging approximately 90%. Thus, the company has also been able to generate highly predictable cash flows that are less influenced by tenant rollover and retention risk. Our expectations suggest that Monmouth could generate considerable price appreciation is FedEx bounces back. Although the REIT securities portfolio remains troubling, Monmouth\\'s dividend appears safe (well-covered) and we can\\'t resist an entry position at the current price point. Shares trade at $13.09 with a dividend yield of 5.2%.\\n\\nWe recently upgraded MNR to STRONG BUY.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nQTS Realty (QTS) is the most enigmatic and perhaps misunderstood of the five data center REITs. This is largely because in February 2018, its management announced a pivot away from its non-core cloud and managed services to focus on hyperscale (public cloud service, software, content, social media giants) and enterprise hybrid IT colocation. Analysts and investors initially felt blindsided and a bit confused and QTS shares were hammered.\" The company is much \"cleaner\" today, and we believe that the valuation is compelling for either private equity or a consolidator such as Digital Realty (DLR) or Equinix (EQIX). In addition, CyrusOne (CONE) could also make the play (for QTS) but is less likely, in our opinion, given the more recent focus internationally. Shareholders can expect mid single-digit dividend increases going forward. There is plenty of room for price appreciation through multiple expansion for QTS shares in 2019 if management continues to deliver solid bookings and adjusted EBITDA margins. Shares are trading at $44.25 with a dividend yield of 4.0%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on QTS.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nTanger Outlets (SKT) is a mall REIT that owns a portfolio of 44 outlet centers with 15.3 million square feet of gross leasable area in the U.S. and Canada. The company focuses on tenanting its space to brand-name retailers: food and services are an afterthought. The success of Tanger\\'s centers has a lot to do with the branding that it has done for over 26 years, which has established the name \"TangerOutlets®\" as a source of popular labels at bargain prices. Although Tanger was recently downgraded by S&P to BBB from BBB+, the company has sufficient free cash flow in 2019 to reduce debt. The dividend is well covered (has increased annually for 26 years) so investors can get paid to wait for Tanger to re-tenant its centers with retailers that thrive in an omni-channel environment. Since free cash flow is likely to remain in excess of $100 million/year, the balance sheet is conservatively levered, the company has the financial strength to weather rent roll-downs and store closures for the next one to two years, or until the tenant mix is optimized. Shares now trade at $20.53 with a dividend yield of 6.8%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on SKT.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nSimon Property (SPG) is a best-in-class mall REIT that owns full or partial stakes in 235 Class A malls in North America, Europe, and Asia totaling over 190 million square feet of retail space. About 80% of the REIT\\'s net operating income comes from its traditional US malls, which are highly diversified, but nearly all located in dense, thriving, and affluent cities, mostly in Florida, California, and Texas. 20% of its NOI is from its super premium Mills locations and international properties, providing US investors with some nice but safe foreign diversification. Simon\\'s cost of capital is just 3.5% (courtesy of one of just 2 \"A\" credit ratings) that allows the company to borrow massive amounts of money at very low interest rates. In addition, the company has access to revolving credit facilities with over $7 billion in remaining liquidity in case it wants to tap short-term credit markets to fund its growth. Not that Simon even needs that, since it\\'s generating $1.35 billion in annual retailed adjusted funds from operations (operating cash flow minus maintenance costs). Simon shares trade at $177.98 with a dividend yield of 4.6%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on SPG.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nVICI Properties (VICI) is a casino REIT that raised around $1.4 billion (one of the largest IPOs in 2018 and one of the largest REIT IPOs ever) after its spinoff from Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., a subsidiary of gaming giant Caesars Entertainment (CZR), which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2017. VICI is one of the country\\'s largest owners of gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations with a geographically diverse portfolio that includes 21 gaming properties, including the world-renowned Caesars Palace, and four championship golf courses. The properties are leased to Caesars Entertainment and operate under leading brands such as Caesars, Horseshoe, Harrah\\'s and Bally\\'s. Collectively, the properties feature approximately 39 million square feet of space, 15,000 hotel rooms and more than 150 restaurants, bars and nightclubs. The company increased its annualized dividend in June 2018 by 9.5% to $1.15 per share after only two quarters of initiating dividend payments and ended the year with approximately $1.1 billion of cash in short-term investments, providing excellent liquidity for future growth. VICI trades at $21.91 with a dividend yield of 5.2%.\\n\\nWe are maintaining a STRONG BUY on VICI.\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nIn closing: As many of you know, I gave up my sneakers for a laptop many years ago, so now I call the play-by-play commentary for the REIT sector.

After many decades of that kind of migration, a few big shifts are appearing: Some hard-hit Rust Belt metros are starting to show signs of stabilization, and the biggest Sun Belt metros are showing signs of strain as congestion gets worse and their affordability worsens.\\n\\nFor instance, even in the fastest-growing large metro areas in the country, all based in the South, their core urban counties are now seeing native-born Americans head for the exits in large numbers. In 2011, Harris County in the Houston metro area, Dallas County in Dallas, Fulton County in Atlanta, and Miami-Dade County in Miami took in a net 35,000 people in domestic migration. In 2018, they lost a combined 115,000 people on the same measure, with a steady deterioration in the years between. This is occurring even at a time when these metro areas have seen less exurban development than in the past cycle, and where their urban cores have been transformed by new apartments and moderate increases in density.\\n\\nSomeone might think that if large Sun Belt metros are now losing residents like older metros were, then those Rust Belt metros must really be having a rough time. But they'd be mistaken.\\n\\nWhile they're still seeing net domestic outflows, Wayne County in the Detroit metro area, Cuyahoga County in Cleveland and Hamilton County in Cincinnati are all seeing less domestic net outmigration now than they were at the start of the decade. Brookings has previously noted that some Midwestern metro areas are now seeing modest net inflows of residents age 25 to 34. Blogger and urbanist Pete Saunders has noted that Detroit's white population has grown substantially this decade, reversing decades of decline.\\n\\nThere are a few trends to note here and to watch in the future. The first is that to the extent Rust Belt metros are stabilizing, it not only means good news for those communities that can focus on revitalizing their economies rather than continuing to lose people to other metros; it also means that those Rust Belt communities will no longer be sources of talent and jobs for the South and the West to the extent that they've been in the past. This will require new recruitment and development strategies for those metros.\\n\\nThe second is that core counties in large Sun Belt metros, now having similar migration patterns to places like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, may have to adapt their governance models to their new realities faster than they might be comfortable with. As older, mature metro areas have shown, the problems of congestion, inequality and affordability don't fix themselves, and generally require a larger tax base than Sun Belt metros are accustomed to. Low taxes are a great selling point when your community is new, with lots of room for growth, but nobody has seemed to figure out how to manage a larger, more mature community with low taxes.\\n\\nThe third is that even while these Sun Belt metros are continuing to grow quickly because of natural population growth, immigration and suburban/exurban population growth, that won't necessarily last forever either. Birthrates continue to fall. The future of immigration policy in the U.S. is highly uncertain. And there's likely a limit to how far out a metro area can develop. Here in Atlanta, while exurban Forsyth and Cherokee counties continue to show positive domestic in-migration and strong population growth, closer-in Gwinnett County, which for decades has been one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, had domestic out-migration for the first time in 2018.\\n\\nTo the extent growth begins to slow in larger Sun Belt metros as size catches up to them and natives decide to leave for greener pastures, where are they going to go? That may turn out to be the key migration question for the next decade. Metros of 1 million to 3 million residents, places like Raleigh and Nashville and Austin, continue to show strong growth, but it remains unclear whether they're willing or able to build out the infrastructure necessary to become as large as Atlanta or Dallas -- or whether they even aspire to get that large. They may hit congestion constraints earlier than their larger peers.\", 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'conor_sen@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Conor Sen', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ihcQ7HuCc8XQ/v1/1200x800.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.1450980392156863, 'wgt': 16}\n",

Joe Giudice\\'s deportation has been postponed by a federal judge after he filed a second appeal, Us Weekly can confirm.\\n\\nAccording to court documents, Teresa Giudice\\'s husband will remain in the country until the court has time to look over his case again. Joe, 46, was released from prison in March after completing his 41-month sentence for fraud and immediately transported into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nJoe was ordered to be deported to his native Italy in October 2018 following his release from prison. While his first appeal in the case was denied earlier this month, his attorneys vowed to continue to fight for him to remain in America.

What Saudi boycott?\\n\\nSix months ago, the murder and dismemberment of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by agents of Saudi Arabia cast a heavy cloud over the kingdom. But now the international business community is revving up its work with the Saudis again, Michael de la Merced, Stanley Reed and Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT report.\\n\\nBusiness leaders had withdrawn from a government-led conference in Riyadh last fall, but that didn\\'t mean that their Saudi projects stopped:\\n\\n* Google continued to work on a data center there, meant to support cloud-computing services in the Middle East.\\n\\n* Blackstone still plans to invest from a $40 billion infrastructure fund that is counting on $20 billion in capital from the Saudis.\\n\\n* Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, sold $12 billion worth of bonds to international investors last week -- on the same day that the U.S. barred 16 Saudis suspected of participating in Mr. Khashoggi\\'s death from entering the country.\\n\\nExecutives say they\\'re trying to support the Saudi people. \"It\\'s the right thing to do for the people of Saudi Arabia,\" Adam Aron, the C.E.O. of AMC Theaters, told the NYT this month when discussing plans to open movie theaters in the country. \"They have been deprived of going to the movies for decades.\"\\n\\nBut there\\'s also plenty of money to be made. Saudi Arabia has 33 million residents, most of them under 30, and it\\'s eager to attract foreign investment to help it revamp its economy.\\n\\nWhether Saudi Arabia can sustain this momentum remains to be seen. \"For people to invest in Saudi Arabia, they need a belief that this country is moving in the right direction,\" Roger Diwan, a vice president at IHS Markit, told the NYT. \"The last 12 months have not been stellar.\"\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nToday\\'s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nPinterest and Zoom beat I.P.O. expectations\\n\\nBoth Pinterest, the digital pin board company, and Zoom, which does videoconferencing, priced their initial public offerings above their initial price ranges yesterday.\\n\\nPinterest priced its shares at $19 each, giving it a fully diluted valuation of $12.7 billion. That means its public debut won\\'t be a \"down round,\" at below the value used for its last private fund-raising. (For Pinterest, that was $12 billion.) Bankers appeared to set the company\\'s initial pricing conservatively, allowing it to vault over low expectations.\\n\\nZoom did better, pricing its shares at $36 apiece. That was $1 above an already raised price range, and made the company worth about $9 billion, nine times the valuation at its last private fund-raising round. Investors seems to appreciate that, unlike many other tech unicorns, it\\'s already profitable.\\n\\nThe strong demand may give some investors confidence in backing further unicorn I.P.O.s. Big investors may not be swayed by apparent trends, a corporate adviser told the FT, but retail investors probably will be.\\n\\nThe real test is still to come when the shares of the two companies start trading on the public markets today. Since Lyft went public two weeks ago, its shares have fallen about 17 percent. The Economist argues that the big question on investors\\' minds is whether these companies (Zoom excepted) can ever make money.\\n\\nIt\\'s Mueller time\\n\\nPerhaps this year\\'s most anticipated event in Washington starts at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, when Attorney General William Barr says he\\'ll unveil a redacted version of Robert Mueller\\'s report. Here are some things to expect:\\n\\nThe White House already knows some of the findings, because the Justice Department shared details with President Trump\\'s team, the NYT reports. That has enabled the White House to prepare a speedy rebuttal, but raises questions about whether the Justice Department acted appropriately.\\n\\nThe report will be \"lightly\" redacted, the WaPo reports. It\\'s expected to lay out a blow-by-blow account of potential obstruction of justice by the president, including analyses of tweets, private threats and more. (The special counsel himself declined to offer a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump broke the law.)\\n\\nIt will be delivered to Congress on CDs. Yes, in 2019. The information will then be posted on the special counsel\\'s website sometime after noon.\\n\\nExpect publishers to rush out physical copies of Mr. Mueller\\'s tome. Pity the typesetters who have to deal with the redactions. And Amazon is expected to start on an audiobook version as soon as there\\'s something to read aloud.\\n\\nIs inflation dead?\\n\\nDid central banks kill inflation off with high interest rates? Did weak economies cause it to shrivel away? Or is it just hiding? Peter Coy of Bloomberg Businessweek went hunting for answers.\\n\\n* While hyperinflation is destructive, a little inflation \"greases the wheels of commerce,\" Mr. Coy writes. It gives the appearance of rising wages and helps central banks encourage borrowing by cutting rates.\\n\\n* \"The Fed has repeatedly missed the target it set in January 2012 of 2 percent annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures. Once you strip out volatile food and energy prices, inflation by that measure has reached 2 percent just one month (July 2018) in the past seven years.\"\\n\\n* \"Researchers are finding that low inflation is in large part a consequence of globalization or automation or deunionization -- or a combination of all three -- which undermine workers\\' power to bargain for higher wages.\"\\n\\n* \"In other words, the capitalists killed inflation.\"\\n\\n* There is no single obvious way to revive inflation, though aggressive fiscal policy might help. But even in countries where that\\'s possible, Mr. Coy writes, there\\'s no apparent political will for that, so the situation could persist for at least a decade.\\n\\nThe U.S. whacks another Chinese telecom giant\\n\\nThe chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, said yesterday that he would oppose China Mobile\\'s application to provide cell service in the U.S., Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports.\\n\\nChina Mobile has been waiting on a decision since 2011. It wanted to connect calls between the U.S. and other nations, not to manage domestic calls.\\n\\nBut \"serious national security and law enforcement risks\" were raised by China Mobile\\'s application, Mr. Pai said in a statement. Senior officials worry that \"calls could be intercepted for surveillance and make the domestic network vulnerable to hacking and other risks,\" Ms. Kang writes.\\n\\nAn internal review and a Commerce Department recommendation pointed the same way, Mr. Pai said, \"because of the potential for espionage, hacking and other security risks,\" according to Ms. Kang. The F.C.C. is an independent, bipartisan agency, but \"Mr. Pai, a Republican, carries tremendous sway because his party holds three of the five commission seats.\"\\n\\nA rejection would escalate the ongoing U.S.-China feud, in which Washington has tried to limit Beijing\\'s increasing telecom dominance. The Trump administration had largely focused on Huawei, but clearly has added to its target list.\\n\\nFor Apple and Qualcomm, 5G really matters\\n\\nWhen the iPhone maker and the modem chip giant settled a tangle of global patent lawsuits on Tuesday, they were focused on the two characters that obsess the entire tech world: 5G.\\n\\nQualcomm has taken an early lead in making the chips that will let cellphones use forthcoming superfast 5G data networks, the WSJ writes; it shifted its focus to that business more than two years ago.\\n\\nSo Apple was in a bind. Fighting Qualcomm, CNBC notes, limited its 5G options to a short and unpalatable list:\\n\\n* Go with Intel, its 4G supplier. But there were rumors of delays at Intel. So that could be risky.\\n\\n* Pick Huawei. But that would mean ignoring Washington\\'s concerns about national security.\\n\\n* Build its own. But Apple\\'s chip design team is relatively new, so that could take a while.\\n\\nApple was seeking as much as $27 billion in damages across its lawsuits against Qualcomm, but ultimately ended up making an undisclosed one-time payment to the chip maker. That underscores 5G\\'s importance to Apple and its rivals.\\n\\nMore: Huawei has promised a $600 5G smartphone.\\n\\nJPMorgan sees two women as potential C.E.O.s\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase reshuffled its executive ranks yesterday, giving two women big new roles -- ones that identify them as possible successors to Jamie Dimon.\\n\\n* Marianne Lake, formerly the C.F.O., will lead the bank\\'s enormous consumer-lending division.\\n\\n* And her successor as C.F.O. will be Jennifer Piepszak, who led the credit-card unit.\\n\\nBoth women gain in prominence. Ms. Lake, already considered a potential future C.E.O., can gain further cred by running one of JPMorgan\\'s most visible divisions.\\n\\nAnd both are seen as having the \"right combination of youth and experience to potentially succeed Mr. Dimon,\" David Benoit of the WSJ writes.

Nina Roberts\\n\\nCompeting bottles of hot sauce in deep reds and oranges line the shelves of supermarkets and gourmet shops. Amazon devotes more than 150 pages to hot sauces, from classics like Cholula to a multitude of artisanal brands with names like Colon Cleaner or Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.\\n\\nWhat kind of entrepreneur would jump into the saturated hot sauce market? Meet Silly Chilly Hot Sauce founder and CEO Sufia Hossain, based in New York City.\\n\\nSubscribe to Observer\\'s Business Newsletter\\n\\nHossain had no professional experience in the food industry or consumer packaged goods. Gloved and masked, Hossain began making her peppery concoctions in her apartment kitchen, always using fresh peppers grown in New York and New Jersey. In 2016, while still perfecting the recipe, she began selling jars with scrappy labels at local outdoor markets.\\n\\nToday, more than 120 stores in greater New York City sell her hot sauces, from the famous spice shop Kalustyan\\'s to neighborhood shops like Foragers and Westerly. The bright orange, life affirming, \"super duper hot\" habanero is the most popular of the three flavors. Silly Chilly will soon be for sale on the shelves of the renowned Light My Fire shop in Los Angeles\\'s historic Farmers Market.\\n\\nWhen Hossain isn\\'t giving tastings, zig-zagging around the city following up with buyers, or traveling on selling tours, she can be found working from a brand new WeWork co-working space of blond wood, part of its Food Labs program, where Hossain was recently accepted.\\n\\nWhile urban foodie types might fantasize about launching a business based on their jams, pickled beets, artisanal breads or funky ice cream flavors, very few attempt it, never mind succeed. Sitting in WeWork\\'s communal area on a minimalist felted sofa, Hossain, originally from Bangladesh, explains how she transitioned from a secure job in the fashion industry to a free wheeling hot sauce impresario.\\n\\nBangladeshi cuisine is quite spicy, is Silly Chilly based on a family recipe?\\n\\nNo. We use a lot of spices in Bangladeshi food, it\\'s spicy by default, so we never need hot sauce; it\\'s already flavorful. I never used hot sauce growing up.\\n\\nWhy did you launch a hot sauce business?\\n\\nI used to spend a lot of time at the farmers markets on the weekends, Union Square, Hoboken and Jersey City. I noticed the peppers, \"Oh, wow, they are so pretty and cute -- so cute!\" The colors, the shapes; I would just buy them.\\n\\nThen, I\\'d come home and have all these peppers. As an experiment, I started making hot sauce and realized I was enjoying it.\\n\\nYou worked at the Gap in merchandizing at the time, were you miserable, a frustrated entrepreneur?\\n\\nI liked the job, but I was unhappy inside because I wasn\\'t doing anything impactful. I actually never had the entrepreneurial spirit, I wanted to be in corporate and climb the ladder.\\n\\nWhat made me passionate about launching Silly Chilly is the connection to the farmers. I had a vision that if Silly Chilly could grow, I could fund many farmers.\\n\\nHad you become friends with pepper farmers at the markets?\\n\\nOh yeah! I built a relationship with Rutgers University Agriculture Farm; they grow a majority of my peppers right now. I work with Dr. [Albert] Ayeni, he managers the program, which has student farmers.\\n\\nI also use other farmers. I pay them directly, whoever is touching the soil, watering the plants, harvesting, so there\\'s no middleman.\\n\\nAfter experimenting in your kitchen, did you plan your next business steps?\\n\\nI haven\\'t followed a traditional path. There wasn\\'t a business plan. I didn\\'t have a grand launch, it just happened, like falling in love with your best friend, you know?\\n\\nWhat made you think Silly Chilly could be successful?\\n\\nValidation from people. I used to force my co-workers [laughs] at the Gap to try it, also my aunt, uncle, roommate. I got validation from strangers (friends sometimes don\\'t want to hurt your feelings, so they say it\\'s good) at the markets.\\n\\nWhat was your first big retail break?\\n\\nI chased the owner of Chelsea Market Baskets, David [Porat], for three months to be in his store. I still remember when he left a voice message, \"Sufia, yes, we\\'d like to have the product in our store.\" I had a little tear in my eye, at that time we were probably in one store. He has been amazing to me.\\n\\nDo you still walk into a store with samples and say, \"If you like it, let me know,\" and then follow up? How does it work?\\n\\nWe work with a buyer at the headquarters if it\\'s a chain store. If it\\'s an individual shop, you might see the buyer or owner. But, \"let me know\" doesn\\'t work, because they will never let you know. It\\'s more, \"I\\'ll call you.\" I also have clients like WeWork and my product is on W.B. Mason, one of the third largest business-to-business distributors.\\n\\nHow did you get Silly Chilly into so many stores in a few years?\\n\\nIt\\'s hustle, hard work and being genuine helps. I\\'m also good at smelling opportunities, meaning, if I smell that potentially something can happen, there\\'s an opportunity, I\\'ll jump in, work on it and follow up.\\n\\nHave you sought any financing?\\n\\nI\\'m bootstrapping it and I\\'ve taken out personal loans, which I am paying off right now. I\\'m small, but I\\'m profitable. I have grown, from 2017 to 2018, I think we grew the business over 500 percent.\\n\\nIn terms of revenue?\\n\\nYes, revenue. I\\'m very focused on selling and putting that money back into the company to scale up, versus raising funds from VCs. I\\'d rather do what I\\'m doing now -- hustling, I\\'m never in one place -- versus raising tons of funds.\\n\\nI am looking for the right investor, someone who will support the mission. As my mom says, \"Be careful what kind of hand you welcome into your home, that hand can put food on your table or mess up the whole apartment.\" [laughs]\\n\\nMaybe you don\\'t need venture capital investment.\\n\\nIt helps. There are certain marketing things I want to do, and I can\\'t because I don\\'t have the funds. I could grow the company a lot right now, a lot!\\n\\nIs there anything about being an immigrant from Bangladesh that impacts Silly Chilly?\\n\\nI could never do what I\\'m doing in Bangladesh, I\\'m so grateful to be here. In the U.S., even if you don\\'t have the biggest funds, you can still do things. But back home, it\\'s not that easy unless you have a lot of connections and money.\\n\\nI immigrated with my parents when I was 12 years old, we lived in Jamaica, Queens. There\\'s a big Bangladeshi community in Jamaica now, people don\\'t go to Jackson Heights anymore; Jamaica has better restaurants and grocery stores.\\n\\nBut in terms of the Bangladeshi community and Silly Chilly, well, I don\\'t have a lot of positive things to say. When I did my Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, many Bangladeshi friends said they didn\\'t have the funds or gave me excuses. I\\'m sorry, but it was freaking $40, these people live the New York City life, they go out for dinners, drinks.\\n\\nOne or two cousins were very supportive. I\\'m going to write an article one day: if you want to detox your surroundings and find out who your friends are, run a crowdfunding campaign.\\n\\nWhat is in the future for Silly Chilly?\\n\\nI have 40,000 units in the warehouse, I\\'m going to sell them this year. We are projecting 300 percent growth from last year.\\n\\nI\\'m launching an initiative with global farmers to produce unique hot sauces with their peppers. The first country I\\'ll be working with is Bangladesh. Although I was born there, I don\\'t have any connections, so I\\'ll visit some villages and find one farmer.\\n\\nThe hot sauce will be manufactured here, we\\'ll see how the market reacts. Eventually, I want to produce locally so we can give back to their community, create jobs; that\\'s my long-term vision.\\n\\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed for clarity.', 'source': {'uri': 'observer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Observer'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'nina_roberts@observer.com', 'name': 'Nina Roberts', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/dsc_6128.jpg?quality=80&crop=0px%2C92px%2C4496px%2C2248px&resize=876%2C438&strip', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2313725490196079, 'wgt': 16}\n",

If artists identified professionally as Latin or Hispanic, they most likely hailed from a Latin-American country and spoke the language.\\n\\nBut today, as Latin culture and music are increasingly absorbed into the pop mainstream and a younger generation of artists and fans embraces a heritage not tied to language alone, the idea of what \"Latin\" means is shifting.\\n\\nBeyond music, \"Latin\" no longer suffices as a simple catch-all term for many within the culture. Some prefer \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\"; others now choose \"Latinx,\" the gender-neutral term coined in the United States and mostly unfamiliar in Latin countries. Within the music industry, the Billboard charts\\' and Latin Grammys\\' definitions of Latin music remain the same, but some are questioning whether the term\\'s scope should be expanded to include artists -- like Jessie Reyez, A.CHAL and Kali Uchis -- who identify as Latin even if they largely don\\'t record in Spanish.\\n\\n\"For me, Latin was always about our cultural heritage, because we share a lot,\" says Creative Artists Agency\\'s Bruno del Granado, who has also managed Ricky Martin and headed Madonna\\'s Maverick Latino label in the early 2000s. \"Now, you get generations who feel very, very Latin even if they don\\'t speak Spanish. They\\'re so fluid. Because I\\'m an immigrant, Spanish is [still] important to me.\"\\n\\nGeographically speaking, Latin people come from Mexico, Central America and parts of the Caribbean, and South America (including Brazil, where Portuguese is spoken). Language was long the glue that bound those cultures and the music together, despite dramatic differences based on country and racial origin. In music, even artists from Spain were considered Latin because they sang in the common language.\\n\\nBut in the United States, where 60% of Latin people are under 27, those who no longer speak the language -- or don\\'t speak it fluently, or don\\'t sing it -- are also now stepping up to reclaim their Latin heritage. \" \\'Latin\\' is far more than language,\" says Jesús Lara, president of Univision Radio. \"It\\'s the relationship with your family; it\\'s that constant strife between your experience in the U.S. and your roots.\"\\n\\nSinger-songwriter A.CHAL, who records R&B/hip-hop mostly in English, identifies as Peruvian, \"but I\\'m also American,\" he says. \"That mix is what my music is, and what my outlook is.\" As noted by Stacie de Armas, Nielsen\\'s vp insights and strategic alliances, in the United States \"cultural connectivity is identity-affirming, and sometimes it takes place in the language and sometimes not.\" While those stateside may focus on music from their countries of origin, \"there is also a \\'U.S. Hispanic experience\\' that is unique to our shared cultural journey in the U.S.,\" adds de Armas. \"U.S. Latinos, regardless of origin, consume and share music from all corners of the Latin music genre.\"\\n\\nCanadian-Colombian Jessie Reyez, who sings in English but speaks fluent Spanish (with a Colombian accent), puts it well: \"In your house, it\\'s Colombia,\" she says, when asked what \"Latin\" means to her. \"It\\'s Latino culture. It\\'s the food. It\\'s the way you speak. The rules you have. When you go outside, it\\'s a whole new culture.

If he does, immigration officials would likely detain her if she posts it because without a visa she has no authorization to be in the country. Zhang faces up to five years if convicted.\\n\\nZhang was arrested March 30 after Secret Service agents say she lied to gain access to the president's exclusive club. She carried two passports, four cellphones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive carrying computer malware, agents said. In a later check of her hotel room, agents say, they found a device for detecting hidden cameras, more computer gear, $8,000 in cash and numerous debit and credit cards. She is not charged with espionage, but the FBI is still investigating. Her bail hearing began last week, but was adjourned to give her public defenders additional time to make a case for her release.\\n\\nThe Secret Service says Zhang gained access by telling an agent outside Mar-a-Lago that she was a member arriving for a swim. Agents say she wasn't on the membership list, but a club manager thought Zhang might be a member's daughter -- about 7% of Chinese nationals are named Zhang, that country's third-most common surname. Agents then asked Zhang if the member was her father, but they say she did not answer definitively. They still admitted her.\\n\\nZhang's story changed when she got inside, agents say, telling a front desk receptionist she was there to attend the United Nations Chinese American Association event scheduled for that evening. No such event was scheduled and agents were summoned. They say she became confrontational, so she was taken off property and then to the local Secret Service office, undergoing about nine hours of questioning. She had arrived in the U.S. two days earlier on a flight from Shanghai to Newark, New Jersey.\\n\\nHer public defender, Robert Adler, suggested during last week's hearing that Zhang might have been not have been lying but confused by the language barrier.\\n\\nA Secret Service agent told Matthewman last week that when an agency analyst uploaded the malware found on Zhang's thumb drive, it immediately began installing and corrupting his computer's files. The Secret Service says when such tests are conducted the computer is not on any network, so no damage was done. Government analysts were still trying to determine the malware's purpose.\\n\\nAdler said wire records show Zhang paid $20,000 in February to Charles Lee, a Chinese national, for admission to the event. Lee ran the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association and was photographed at least twice with Cindy Yang, a Republican donor and former Florida massage parlor owner. She recently made news after it was learned she was promising Chinese business leaders that her consulting firm could get them access to Mar-a-Lago and mingle with the president.\\n\\nYang previously owned a spa where New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution.

He\\'s in a really bad spot. He\\'s locked up in a jail cell with bars. The other facility that he was at, he wasn\\'t in a jail cell. So he\\'s having a very, very hard time, and he really wants to get out.\"\\n\\nIn October 2018, an immigration judge ordered Joe, 46, to be deported to his native Italy after completing his 41-month prison sentence for fraud. Joe filed an appeal the following month, which \"could take another year\" to be approved or denied, according to Gorga.\\n\\n\"The guy is just in misery,\" the Gorga Guide to Success author, 39, tells Us. \"We don\\'t know anything yet.\"\\n\\nTeresa, 46, is also having a tough time. \"Teresa\\'s put up a good front, but our relationship is very tight right now and [I] know she breaks down to me,\" Gorga adds. \"She just has to keep it strong for those for little girls [Gia, 18, Gabriella, 14, Milania, 13, and Audriana, 9].

The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei\\'s Iran business.\\n\\nMeng defense lawyer Scott Fenton told the court that during Meng\\'s three-hour detention at the airport in December, Meng\\'s rights \"were placed in total suspension.\"\\n\\nThe lawyers also argue Meng cannot be extradited because the conduct at issue would not be criminal in Canada.\\n\\nThe bank and wire fraud charges do not meet that criteria because Meng is accused of misrepresenting HSBC to engage in transactions that violate US sanctions laws, the lawyers said. They also note that, under 2019 Canadian sanction law, there would be no risk of fines or forfeiture for any bank in Canada.\\n\\n\"Put another way, the alleged offense could only exist in a country that prohibits international financial transactions in relation to Iran,\" the lawyers said in court documents. \"Canada is no longer such a country.\"\\n\\nMeng\\'s lawyers did not say when they would apply for the stay of the extradition hearing, whose date has not been set. She will next appear in court on Sept. 23, when her defense will make more applications for further disclosure surrounding her arrest at the airport. The process could take years.\\n\\nMeng\\'s case has attracted global attention and sparked a diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Ottawa.

The A\\'s started sharing the stadium with the Oakland Raiders in 1995, meaning a not insignificant part of Mr. Rinetti\\'s job became running the stadium\\'s changeovers from football to baseball.\\n\\nAs the team inches toward a new waterfront stadium, I talked with Mr. Rinetti about what it takes to get the 50-year-old Oakland Coliseum ready for the season, and what he\\'ll miss most about the Brutalism exemplar.\\n\\nSo you\\'ve been around for a while. Tell me about how your job has changed since 1994.\\n\\nIt\\'s changed significantly based upon a lot of the security things. After 9/11, security procedures changed significantly. And then after the Boston Marathon bombing, it changed again, because the league required all teams to do metal detection.\\n\\nHow long do the changeovers take, and how many people are involved?\\n\\nMy guess is probably close to 100 people that are involved to switch things around. It really depends on how much time we have to get to the next event.\\n\\nThe quickest turnaround that I recall was in 2013. We had a playoff game against the Tigers here, Game 2 of the American League division series on a Saturday and the game ended probably close to 10 p.m. that night and the Raiders had a game the next night at 8 p.m. I think they were done in somewhere around 12 hours.\\n\\nAnything you think you\\'d miss?\\n\\nI\\'ve been there my entire adult life there you know.

According to Institutional Investor\\'s latest Rich List, he knows what he\\'s talking about, Andrew writes.\\n\\nMr. Dalio is the world\\'s wealthiest hedge fund manager this year. The magazine estimates that he earned $2 billion in the last 12 months, up from a reported $1.3 billion in 2017.\\n\\nSome other notable names and rankings:\\n\\n2. Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies, $1.5 billion\\n\\n3. Ken Griffin of Citadel, $870 million\\n\\n8. David Shaw of D.E. Shaw, $500 million\\n\\n9. Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management, $465 million\\n\\n22. Steve Cohen of Point72, $70 million\\n\\nThis list reflects hedge funds\\' tough run in recent years, Andrew adds. When Mr. Dalio last topped the list, in 2011, he had reportedly made $3.9 billion.\\n\\n\"But the magnitude of the hedge fund managers\\' compensation raises a very basic question about whether capitalism is \\'broken,\\'\" Andrew writes. \"Even if Mr. Dalio took home $500 million, the rest of his income could pay 10,000 families $150,000 each.\"\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nToday\\'s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nWeWork plans an I.P.O.\\n\\nThe co-working company said yesterday that it had filed confidentially to go public, potentially becoming the latest $10 billion-plus \"decacorn\" to pursue a stock listing, Michael de la Merced and Andrew report in the NYT.\\n\\nWeWork\\'s I.P.O. would be a big one. The company was last valued at about $47 billion, which would make it one of the largest market debuts in some time.

WeWork\\'s losses doubled last year to $1.9 billion. The company says growth has to come first, but critics wonder whether it will ever make money -- and what its books would look like in a recession.\\n\\nTrump sues his bankers for privacy\\n\\nPresident Trump, his family and his company sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One yesterday, in an effort to prevent the banks from telling Congress about their finances.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees weeks ago. They\\'re investigating potential money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe, unnamed sources told the NYT.\\n\\nThe bank could provide a trove of details on Mr. Trump\\'s finances. Since the late 1990s, it has been the only mainstream financial firm to do business with him. His son, Donald Trump Jr., and the family of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also borrowed there.\\n\\nMr. Trump and his team plan to fight all subpoenas, arguing that they are point-scoring efforts by Democrats. The White House and the Justice Department have ordered current and former Trump aides not to comply.\\n\\n\"The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump,\" the Trumps argued in the latest lawsuit. \"No grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one.\"\\n\\nAlphabet\\'s growth slipped. Blame ads, possibly.\\n\\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, said revenue in its most recent quarter rose 17 percent from the same period last year. That was its first quarter without growth of 20 percent or more since 2016, Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT writes.\\n\\nAlphabet blamed the strong dollar, which dented revenue by $1.2 billion. \"Google executives rattled off a long list of currencies weakening against the dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Brazilian real and Indian rupee,\" Mr. Wakabayashi writes.\\n\\nOtherwise, executives \"did not offer much detail\" about the slowdown. Alphabet does not employ a quarter-by-quarter strategy, they said, and it invests for the long term.\\n\\nBut its ad business may be under strain. \"Alphabet said clicks on advertisements on sites like Google and YouTube grew 39 percent -- a notch below increases of 50 to 60 percent in recent quarters,\" Mr. Wakabayashi writes. And \"the rate at which consumers are clicking on YouTube ads is not increasing as fast as before.\"\\n\\nWall Street was spooked, having expected a 19 percent increase in growth. Alphabet\\'s revenue was short of expectations by $1 billion, and its stock slid in after-hours trading.\\n\\nA gig economy firm gets its business model blessed\\n\\nThe Labor Department has exempted an unnamed organization from enforcing pay standards that are applied to employees, Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes.\\n\\nGig economy companies like contractor status because it means they don\\'t have to pay minimum wages (some Uber drivers reportedly earn as little as $5 an hour). It also means they don\\'t need to provide overtime or holiday pay, or pay a share of Social Security taxes.\\n\\nNow one company is officially off the hook. The Labor Department declared that one organization, whose workers appear to clean residences, are contractors and not employees. It\\'s a shift from the Obama administration view, which had pushed for workers to be classified as employees.\\n\\n\"While the decision officially applies only to that company, legal experts said it was likely to affect a much larger portion of the industry,\" Mr. Scheiber writes.\\n\\nThat\\'s good news for Uber and Lyft, in particular, which have both cited their workers being labelled as employees as a major threat to their business models.\\n\\nAmerica\\'s latest annual report card\\n\\nSince leaving Microsoft, Steve Ballmer has focused a lot of his time on USAFacts, a start-up that produces what he calls a nonpartisan 10-K for the U.S. The group presents its third big report today, but here\\'s a sneak peek at some of the highlights:\\n\\n* \"Families and individuals in the middle 20 percent of income earners make 9 percent less in wages and salaries than they did in 2000; however, they also receive 59 percent more in transfers from the government and pay 12 percent less in taxes.\"\\n\\n* \"In 2016, federal, state, and local governments ran a combined deficit of $770 billion, close to our total government spending on national defense and veterans in that same year.\"\\n\\n* \"Government health insurance programs cost more than private insurance, but the cost of private insurance is rising faster.\"\\n\\nBoeing\\'s C.E.O. isn\\'t going anywhere\\n\\nIn his first major public address since the grounding of the 737 Max fleet, Boeing\\'s C.E.O., Dennis Muilenburg, faced questions at a shareholder meeting about the company\\'s credibility and its safety procedures following two fatal crashes, Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT writes.\\n\\n* \"Asked whether he had considered resigning, Mr. Muilenburg said he planned to stay in his role.\"\\n\\n* \"Shareholders at the meeting pressed the chief executive to account for possible design flaws in the jet and in the regulatory oversight of the company. During one exchange, a shareholder asked him why the plane was built with a system that relied on a single point of failure.\"\\n\\n* \"Mr. Muilenburg said the design of that system was \\'consistent with our processes\\' and noted that safety was Boeing\\'s top priority. The fix is expected to be submitted to the F.A.A. in the coming weeks.\"\\n\\n* Boeing also said that an alert that was \"supposed to inform pilots when two sensors on the plane disagreed was not functioning as intended.\" It worked \"only if airlines had bought an optional feature that showed readings from those sensors on displays in the cockpit.\"\\n\\n* But \"with the certified software update implemented, the 737 Max will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly,\" Mr. Muilenburg vowed.\\n\\nDemocrats struggle to sway voters on corporate tax\\n\\nSeveral Democratic presidential hopefuls see tax avoidance by big companies as a powerful campaign theme. But so far they don\\'t seem to be getting their message across, Stephanie Saul and Patricia Cohen of the NYT write.\\n\\n60 Fortune 500 companies paid no federal taxes on $79 billion in corporate income last year, according to a recent report. Amazon said its effective tax rate last year was below zero: It got a $10.8 billion rebate.\\n\\nDemocrats want to change that. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, in particular, have called for changes to the corporate tax system.\\n\\nBut they haven\\'t figured out how to turn anxiety over income inequality into a political advantage. President Trump is \"at least talking about how good the economy is and what I\\'ve done for you,\" David Betras, the Democratic chairman in Mahoning County, told the NYT.\\n\\nCorporate taxes may not resonate with voters in the same way topics like health care or immigration do.

The designation, which took effect April 15 , is part of a broader administration effort to increase pressure on Tehran.\\n\\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking Wednesday in New York, said the administration is creating dangerous conditions with its campaign against Tehran. \"Iranians are allergic to pressure,\" he said, adding that he believes the conflict can be resolved diplomatically.\\n\\nUnder U.S. immigration law, foreigners found to have provided designated foreign terrorist organizations with \"material support\" can be banned from the U.S.\\n\\nWhen it was announced earlier this month, the designation raised fears that U.S. diplomats and troops might have to end contacts with officials in countries that have ties with Iran or elements of the Guard, a paramilitary organization formed in the wake of Iran\\'s 1979 Islamic Revolution to defend its clerically overseen government.\\n\\nLebanon, where Iran and the Guard are active in their support of the militant Hezbollah movement, and Iraq, where they back Shiite militias and have close ties to the government, are two such countries where the U.S. is heavily engaged on military and diplomatic fronts.\\n\\nPompeo said in the notices that he decided to waive the travel bans in U.S. foreign policy and national security interests.\\n\\nIn one notice, he said the sanctions \"shall not apply to any ministry, department, agency, division, or other group or subgroup within any foreign government\" unless that entity is covered by existing U.S. sanctions.\\n\\nIn the second notice, he said the sanctions won\\'t apply \"to any business, organization, or group, whether public or private, solely based on its provision of material support to any foreign government sub-entity that has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\"\\n\\n\"At first glance, it looks like a wise carve-out,\" said Daniel Fried, a former sanctions coordinator for the State Department who is now with The Atlantic Council. \"One of the rules of sanctions is that you need to account for unintended consequences and have wide licensing and waiver authority. Otherwise, if there are unintended consequences you find yourself unable to act.\"\\n\\nThe notices were published two days after the administration announced that it would not renew sanctions waivers for countries that import Iranian oil. Those waivers, which primarily affect five countries -- China and India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey -- expire on May 2. The announcement sparked a spike in world oil prices due to global supply concerns.\\n\\nIn the days since, however, concerns have been raised by Iran hawks that the administration may not impose sanctions on countries continuing their imports.\\n\\nUnder one scenario being considered by the administration, the countries could be allowed to place and pay for future orders of Iranian oil before May 2, essentially front-loading continued imports, according to officials, congressional aides and outside advisers familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\\n\\nThe administration could then grant waivers from sanctions to transport and refine the oil under a 2012 law.\\n\\nThe State Department declined to comment on the possibility that Iranian oil imports might continue without sanctions.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump has said the goal is to cut Iranian oil exports to zero to choke off the estimated $50 billion a year it provided before sanctions were reinstated in November following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\\n\\nBut officials in charge of Iran policy have not ruled out the possibility of allowing some importers additional time to wind down those purchases, drawing criticism from supporters of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign aimed at Tehran, which the U.S. says destabilizes the Middle East by supporting militant activity around the region.\\n\\n\"I think maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Pompeo earlier this month at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing during which he implored the administration to adopt the strictest possible interpretation of the sanctions.\\n\\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., concurred. \"Going forward, the proper amount of oil exports from Iran is zero.\"\\n\\nOutside opponents of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal also say exports must be eliminated for the maximum pressure campaign to succeed.\\n\\n\"There is no maximum pressure campaign without eliminating all Iranian oil exports. That must be the immediate objective,\" said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a critic of the deal.', 'source': {'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@foxnews.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/1024/512/ContentBroker_contentid-96847488158e4a88a36b81e30c18142c.png?ve=1&tl=1', 'eventUri': 'eng-4741161', 'sentiment': -0.2235294117647059, 'wgt': 13}\n",

It May Not Be Enough.', 'body': 'Good Friday morning. This weekend, I\\'m headed to Omaha to ask Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger questions at Berkshire Hathaway\\'s annual meeting. If you have questions you\\'d like to suggest, please email them to me. Also: The Labor Department releases its latest jobs report this morning -- here\\'s what to expect. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)\\n\\nElon Musk\\'s latest U-turn\\n\\nTesla said yesterday that it would sell about $2 billion in stock and bonds to help fund its operations after a worse-than-expected first quarter.\\n\\nIt\\'s the first time in two years that Tesla has sold securities to raise money. Elon Musk had said for months that Tesla did not need to raise new capital.\\n\\nIt\\'s necessary because Tesla hasn\\'t sold enough cars to cover its operating costs. Sales of the Model 3 tumbled in the first quarter, and the company used over 40 percent of its available cash during that quarter.\\n\\nThe timing is questionable. \"It probably would have made more financial sense when Tesla\\'s stock price was a lot higher,\" Peter Eavis of the NYT writes. Tesla\\'s stock is down a third from its 2018 peak, so it has to sell more shares to raise money -- diluting the investments of existing shareholders.\\n\\nShares in Tesla jumped 4.3 percent after the announcement. \"This is an upside-down reaction,\" the research analyst Joseph Osha told the WSJ. \"But it tells you the issue of liquidity has been on people\\'s minds, and this capital raise puts that issue to bed.\"\\n\\nBut is it actually enough? Mr. Eavis writes that the sale should cover the production of current models, but not the funding of new vehicles. More production delays could deplete cash, forcing Tesla to go back to the markets again and giving rivals time to eat into its market share.\\n\\nMore: Tesla reportedly expects a shortage of minerals used to create electric vehicle batteries.\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nToday\\'s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, Michael J. de la Merced in Washington, D.C. and Jamie Condliffe in London.\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nStephen Moore won\\'t be a Fed governor\\n\\nPresident Trump said yesterday that he won\\'t nominate Stephen Moore to the Fed\\'s board, after the economics commentator faced growing criticism over his qualifications and past writings about women.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s news was a swift U-turn for Mr. Moore. Just two hours before the president tweeted the announcement, Mr. Moore had told the WSJ and other news outlets that he would continue to seek a nomination to the Fed.\\n\\nMr. Moore blamed \"gutter campaign tactics and personal assaults\" for the about-face in a WSJ op-ed. Critics had questioned his potential politicization of the Fed and his failure to make child support and alimony payments to his former wife, as well as past writings that denigrated women.\\n\\nIt was a blow to the White House. Mr. Moore is the second of the president\\'s Fed choices to withdraw from consideration in recent weeks. Herman Cain bowed out last month amid criticism over previous accusations of sexual harassment.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear whether Mr. Trump will nominate anyone else to fill the two empty spots on the Fed\\'s board. The NYT notes that Fed officials are unconcerned about the vacancies.\\n\\nMore details about Facebook\\'s crypto push\\n\\nFacebook\\'s plan to build its own cryptocurrency is one of tech\\'s poorer-kept secrets. Now, the WSJ has published a report containing more details from unidentified sources about the effort.\\n\\nFacebook is developing a digital coin, as the NYT reported earlier this year. It is expected to be pegged to the value of a basket of foreign currencies to ensure the stability of the coin. According the WSJ, the initiative is code-named Project Libra.\\n\\nThe coin could be used to settle payments between people, as well as making purchases on Facebook and other websites, the WSJ reports. Facebook is also considering \"paying users fractions of a coin when they view ads, interact with other content or shop on its platform -- not unlike loyalty points,\" the WSJ adds.\\n\\nThe company is in talks with major financial institutions, according to the WSJ, including Visa and Mastercard. It is said to be seeking as much as $1 billion -- a figure first reported by the NYT\\'s Nathaniel Popper -- to \"underpin the value of the coin to protect it from the wild price swings seen in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s also in discussions with merchants who it wants to adopt the coin. The WSJ says Facebook would \"seek smaller financial investments from those partners.\"\\n\\nMore Facebook news: The company yesterday evicted seven of its most controversial users, many of them conservatives, inflaming the debate about the power and accountability of Big Tech. Its potential settlement with the F.T.C. could include actions against WhatsApp. And Mark Zuckerberg\\'s property portfolio is growing.\\n\\nHow Deutsche Bank saw Trump\\'s tax returns\\n\\nCongress is struggling to get a glimpse of President Trump\\'s tax returns. But a team from Deutsche Bank, Mr. Trump\\'s longtime lender, has seen them, and Bloomberg has the story on how that played out, according to unidentified sources.\\n\\n* \"The bankers got a look before agreeing to lend to the Trump Organization in 2012,\" the sources said.\\n\\n* Mr. Trump\\'s daughter Ivanka \"served as the primary contact between the Trump Organization and Deutsche Bank in early discussions ahead of 2012 loans,\" which were as much as $100 million.\\n\\n* \"When the bank balked, Ivanka offered to guarantee the loans with Trump\\'s personal assets.\"\\n\\n* The Trump Organization\\'s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, \"allowed the bankers to see relevant parts of Trump\\'s tax returns and take notes.\" They \"weren\\'t allowed to make copies of the documents.\"\\n\\n* \"Deutsche Bank structured the subsequent funding as recourse loans, meaning that the bank could come after Trump\\'s personal assets in the event of default.\"\\n\\n* Ultimately, the bank \"extended more than $300 million in loans to Trump from 2012 to 2015,\" suggesting that his finances were relatively strong.\\n\\nThe passé Chamber of Commerce\\n\\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce was traditionally the main voice of corporate America in Washington. Now it finds itself out of favor, Brody Mullins and Alex Leary of the WSJ report.\\n\\nThe Trump administration\\'s populism ran counter to the Chamber\\'s goals. The White House has pushed for tariffs and limits on immigration, something that many of the group\\'s members opposed. And President Trump has chafed at criticism from Chamber officials.\\n\\nBut the Chamber failed to find friends among Democrats. \"The chamber dug themselves into a deep, deep hole when they decided to become an arm of the Republican Party and even oppose moderate Democrats,\" Senator Chuck Schumer told the WSJ.\\n\\nIts financial clout has also weakened. The number of companies contributing $1 million or more to the Chamber fell to 23 in 2017 from 42 in 2012 -- and some companies, like CVS Health and Apple, have dropped out altogether in recent years.\\n\\nAnd it may be out of step with the times. Corporate America doesn\\'t speak with one voice anymore, and the Chamber now competes with an array of super PACs and advocacy coalitions focused on narrow issues.\\n\\nOpioid executives guilty of racketeering\\n\\nA federal jury convicted the top executives of Insys Therapeutics, a maker of a fentanyl-based painkiller, of racketeering yesterday, Gabrielle Emanuel and Katie Thomas of the NYT report.\\n\\n* \"During the 10-week trial, federal prosecutors had detailed Insys\\'s audacious marketing plan -- which included paying doctors for sham educational talks and luring others with lap dances -- to spur sales of Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray approved to treat patients with cancer.\"\\n\\n* The Insys executives found guilty include John Kapoor, the founder; Richard Simon, the former director of sales; and Michael Gurry, the former vice president of managed markets.\\n\\n* \"The government suggested that executives at the Arizona-based company often operated like drug dealers and that Mr. Kapoor was the ringleader.\"\\n\\n* \"The verdict against Insys executives is a sign of the accelerating effort to hold pharmaceutical and drug distribution companies and their executives and owners accountable in ways commensurate with the devastation wrought by the prescription opioid crisis.\"\\n\\n* \"Experts said the Insys verdict could encourage other corporate prosecutions and said it demonstrated that the public was willing to mete out penalties for high-level executives at companies profiting from the sales of highly addictive painkillers.\"\\n\\nWhy wages are finally rising\\n\\nWhen unemployment falls, wages usually rise. But the American economy missed that memo in recent years. Pay has been stagnant despite a tight labor market, leaving economists scratching their heads.\\n\\nThat recently started to change, Ben Casselman of the NYT writes:\\n\\n* \"Average hourly earnings in March were 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier, the eighth straight month in which growth topped 3 percent.\"\\n\\n* Today\\'s monthly jobs report is likely to make that nine.\\n\\nThe reason: The job market wasn\\'t actually as good as the unemployment rate made it look.\\n\\n* \"The government\\'s official definition of unemployment is relatively narrow. It counts only people actively looking for work, which means it leaves out many students, stay-at-home parents or others who might like jobs if they were available.\"\\n\\n* When employers tap that broader pool of potential labor, they don\\'t need to raise wages as quickly.\\n\\n* And that\\'s what happened: \"In recent months, more than 70 percent of people getting jobs had not been counted as unemployed the previous month.\"\\n\\n* \"That is well above historical levels, and a sign that the strong labor market is drawing people off the sidelines.\"\\n\\nRevolving door\\n\\nDavid Seaton abruptly resigned yesterday as C.E.O. of the engineering and construction company Fluor.\\n\\nCharlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway, which is Wells Fargo\\'s biggest shareholder, said that the bank\\'s next C.E.O. shouldn\\'t come from Wall Street and said he would have kept Tim Sloan in that job.\\n\\nThe speed read\\n\\nDeals\\n\\n* Sinclair, the largest U.S. broadcast station owner, reportedly plans to buy 21 regional sports networks from Walt Disney for over $10 billion.

In chess, zugzwang occurs when it\\'s your move, but your opponent has cannily set you up to dig yourself deeper into defeat. It\\'s a useful concept for anyone who needs to outmaneuver an enemy without staging a frontal assault. And as Taylor Mason\\'s ruthless new right-hand woman, Sara Hammon (Samantha Mathis), realizes in this week\\'s episode of \"Billions,\" zugzwang is the name of the game for every player on the board right now.\\n\\nThank Grigor Andolov for that. As he has threatened many times, and proved last week by orchestrating the abduction of Wags, that menacing Russian will stop at nothing to protect his investment in Taylor\\'s company. This means that Bobby\\'s best play is to cut off his former protégé\\'s supply of cash by cutting sweetheart deals with banks that are in a bad way. They\\'ll owe him a favor and take their business elsewhere, with minimal exposure on his end.\\n\\nFor Axe, there is an ancillary bonus. Scoping out a bank that has made a bad investment in robots that can barely walk without tripping, he makes the acquaintance of Rebecca Cantu (Nina Arianda), a fellow billionaire who made her fortune by recognizing the best products to sell on a home shopping network and thus sees right through the robot manufacturer\\'s song and dance. It\\'s a match made in heaven\\'s V.I.P. lounge.\\n\\nThe two go into business by splitting her share of an industrial cleaning company, then have sex to celebrate. They get in a shouting match when Rebecca realizes Axe was responsible for an immigration sting that sunk the company\\'s competition, making him money she could have had for herself. They make up when he agrees to give half of her shares back, plus the profits on them, in exchange for her promise not to float Taylor any money herself.\\n\\n\"You hungry?\" he asks, smiling. \"I could eat,\" she replies, smiling back. Seconds earlier they\\'d been talking about the 4,200 industrial-cleaning workers suddenly looking for jobs. For those people it\\'s a crisis. For these billionaires it\\'s foreplay.\\n\\nBut it\\'s tough to out-zugzwang a genius like Taylor. When the banks close their coffers, along comes Grigor, literally singing, \"Here I come to save the day!\" (If you\\'ve ever wanted to hear John Malkovich sing the \"Mighty Mouse\" theme song with a Russian accent, this is the show for you.) He presents Mason with a pair of gangster acquaintances named the Kozlov Brothers. Their blood money could keep the company afloat, yes. But they\\'re even more dangerous than Grigor, and since Grigor controls them anyway, he would have a bigger share of the company than all the other investors combined.\\n\\nSo Taylor uses Axe to do the dirty work. Calling one of the banks that rejected Taylor Mason Capital for a loan -- the same bank Bobby bailed out on the bad robot deal -- Mason implies that the Kozlovs have bought in when in fact the deal has not yet been done. This gets back to Axe, who instructs the bank to pull all its cash from the Kozlovs, leaving them with no money to loan even if Taylor wanted them to.\\n\\nTaylor then turns to Grigor, saying that the bad news is that the Kozlovs have no money. But the good news is, well, the Kozlovs have no money, and Grigor can eat up their empire wholesale ... so long as he uses his clout to open the banks back up to Mason Cap.\\n\\nIt\\'s a near-identical play to the one Chuck makes when his new ally, Police Commissioner Sansone, asks him to look into shady doings in the police pension fund -- particularly those involving its administrator, Raul Gomez (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), an old rival from their academy days. Chuck quickly learns that Raul is Bobby\\'s guy, and that Bobby is running the pension fund behind the scenes, using a surrogate hedge-funder named Michael Panay (Hari Dhillon) as a cat\\'s paw.\\n\\nSo Chuck advises Sansone to go after Panay rather than Gomez, then to cozy up to Panay\\'s successor -- drumroll, please -- Bobby Axelrod, who has been cleared of wrongdoing and can get back into business with the cops. All Chuck asks for in return is Sansone\\'s endorsement of his candidacy for New York State Attorney General, which he delivers at the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy.\\n\\nAnother scheme, another fall guy, another way for top dogs like Chuck, Bobby and Taylor to manipulate frenemies into doing their bidding.\\n\\nStrong B-plots complement the main action, presenting other characters with their own moral dilemmas. Taylor\\'s trusted underling Mafee (Dan Soder), the genial man-child who quit Axe Cap last season when he realized he\\'d been manipulated by Axe and Wendy, refuses to extend a similar lifeline to his buddy Rudy (Chris Carfizzi), whom Axe fired last week for fraternizing with the enemy -- namely, Mafee. It\\'s cold, but Rudy isn\\'t a great trader. In Mafee\\'s view, taking him on would be more trouble than he\\'s worth.\\n\\nWendy is faced with an even more personal dilemma. During a frank after-hours conversation about sex at a party with her co-workers, she crows that her and Chuck\\'s bedroom policy is \"Action whenever either of us [expletive] wants it.\" But when she asks for warm, intimate, face-to-face sex, Chuck insists on breaking out the whips and chains -- going so far as to beg after she tells him she\\'d rather not.\\n\\nThat\\'s precisely the kind of behavior she ridiculed as the province of \"sexual panhandlers\" at the party, as prompted by Bonnie (an excellent Sarah Stiles), the big-haired, bawdy trader who manspreads during her therapy sessions and insists that no woman wants a whiner. But as Wendy learns from their former dominatrix Troy (Clara Wong), submitting to sexual power is Chuck\\'s \"arousal template,\" and it\\'s unshakable.\\n\\nStill, there\\'s a sense that the real power plays have yet to come. Insofar as this is only the second in a 12-episode season, that\\'s to be expected. But the various schemes and shenanigans that Chuck, Bobby and Taylor have been running feel minor, even so. The characters scratch a few backs, grease a few palms, hamstring a few second-stringers, fiddle around the margins and avoid direct attacks -- zugzwang instead of checkmate. On this show, it\\'s an odd sensation.\\n\\nBut checkmate remains the ultimate goal, even when they\\'re merely moving pawns around the board. Chuck wants to become attorney general, giving him the political clout he needs to fight back against his rivals Jock Jeffcoat and Bryan Connerty. Bobby wants to eliminate Grigor and destroy Taylor.\\n\\nAnd both men are addicted to power, plain and simple -- it\\'s their arousal template. The big questions, for both the characters and the show, are when will the payoffs come, and will they be worth the buy-in when they do?', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'sean_t_collins@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Sean T.

Is a real options I wanna take a look at Sarah Sanders on ABC's. This week. What this is an option on the table I mean how we talked about. A number of different things over the last two years that we'd love to see happen certainly this wouldn't be our first choice because. Ideally we wouldn't be dealing with a massive influx of illegal immigrants coming across the border. The crisis that we have both from a national security and humanitarian standpoint. Is it Democrats would step up and help the president fix the laws. This all could go away we wouldn't be having this discussion and that would be the best thing for the country. And that would certainly be the best way to solve this crisis does things this problem and we don't wanna put all of the burden on one or take border communities. And Democrats have stated time and time again they support open borders that supports Sanctuary Cities so let's spread out some of that burden and let's put it in some of those other. Locations. If that's what they want to see happen error refusing to actually help fix the problem. Our and I want to bring in Karen Travers he's at the White House Karen what's the deal on this is this something that's actually possible. I think it's interesting to see the White House now Kimberly tell us scramble to fill in the pieces after they had told us late last week and this is a proposal that was floated. And rejected that's a thing stood on Friday. And then the president started talking about it and tweaking about it and now it's back on the table so last week not on the table the president says it is. And now the White House says it is but that it's not their first choice. As a game plan he. And here you heard Sarah Sanders say that they were look at other options but they're pushing congress to step in now and come up with a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Anyway we've seen congress try and do that and it really hasn't gone anywhere it's a tricky very complicated issue and right now the political climate here in Washington is just so partisan it's hard to see how both sides could come together and do something that the president could sign onto that could also actually passed in the house controlled by the Democrats. So right now the president I think you'll see him keep talking about this but. Actually doing this there's no plan to implement this right now we should know that Homeland Security officials twice rejected this because they say. It would be difficult to do it would be very costly. And then the question where does that money come from. Yet I think another question now we have to ask is. Is it legal I mean this is something that president trump was against before cutting funding to Sanctuary Cities so is this something that is actually illegal. The president says he had the absolute right to do this and he can say now but the question is how do you pay for this migration. You're talking about taking migrants and busing them are moving on hundreds if not thousands of miles away from where they came across the border. Where they're being detained or held and that would be very difficult it's not a smooth migration there so who pays for it and if the administration is looking to shift funding offers something that congress has already approved and put it today as you can be assured congress is going to jump in on this and say not so fast and it's insane argument we saw with building the border wall the president wants to do it he says he's gonna take money approved for acts and putting to why that's not how it works on Capitol Hill. So I think the questions of legality coming in coming up but they're really about where that funding would be and can the president take money and do that. And I'm just curious what are Republicans saying about this potential plan B Lindsey Graham over the weekend say that he wouldn't start the process of immigration overhaul that when congress comes back after their recess. If we get down to business on this but I mean this is an elusive thing here in Washington. Congress is tried to do this before they try to do in the previous administration and they couldn't even get anywhere Democrats say you know what was the White House doing over the last two years when the president had both the house and senate. There have been hard and it can even more difficult hour.

Here\\'s what you need to know today ...\\n\\nAn asylum overhaul to counter a border crisis\\n\\nPresident Trump has called for a sweeping overhaul to an asylum system he has long said is rife with fraud -- including a new fee to process asylum applicants, and the capacity to rapidly adjudicate applicants\\' claims while also barring them from working in the U.S. in the meantime. In a presidential memorandum, Trump specifically told Attorney General Barr and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan that the move was necessary to address a crisis at the border. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months, with border agents making more than 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high. Immigration courts that process asylum claims currently have a backlog of more than 800,000 cases.\\n\\n\\'Issued to harass\\': Trump sues to block subpoenas of business records\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Monday against Deutsche Bank and Capital One in an attempt to block congressional subpoenas for his business records, claiming House Democrats are simply attempting to harass him. Two House committees subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and several other financial institutions earlier this month as part of investigations into Trump\\'s finances. The lawsuit by Trump, his sons Donald Jr. and Eric and his daughter Ivanka, was filed in Manhattan federal court. The Trump Organization and the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust are among the other plaintiffs. Politico reported that in a joint statement, Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee and Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called the Trump suit \"meritless\" and claimed it was a delay tactic.\\n\\nTension over Attorney General Barr\\'s testimony escalates\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Monday night that President Trump \"has demonstrated on a daily basis his obstruction of justice\" amid a conflict between the White House and Congress over the terms of scheduled testimony by Attorney General William Barr before the House Judiciary Committee. Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary panels this week on Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s report. However, the Justice Department informed the House committee on Sunday that Barr would not attend the scheduled Thursday hearing if committee lawyers seek to question him.\\n\\nWhen asked if she had a message for Barr Monday evening, Pelosi said: \"Respect the constitution. Honor your oath of office. Honor the request of Congress. For the American people.\" The skirmish over Barr\\'s testimony came as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his long-anticipated resignation, effective May 11. The growing tension could add even more intrigue to Tuesday\\'s scheduled meeting between Trump, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on a national infrastructure package.\\n\\n\\'Medicare for All\\' showdown\\n\\nHouse Democrats will hold their first-ever hearing on Medicare for All legislation on Tuesday, advancing a sweeping proposal that several prominent 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have embraced -- even as some progressives caution the hearing may amount to a \"farce,\" and President Trump and top Republicans call the idea a socialist prescription for disaster. The 10 a.m. ET Rules Committee hearing concerns the Medicare for All Act of 2019, which promises to rapidly provide coverage for \"all people living in the U.S.\" within two years, according to the current draft of the bill and a summary released by Washington Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal. (WATCH Sen. Bernie Sanders defend his \"Medicare for All\" plan in the video from his Fox News Town Hall above.)\\n\\n\\'Gone way too soon\\': Remembering director John Singleton\\n\\nHollywood is mourning the loss of Oscar-nominated writer and director John Singleton. The 51-year-old \"Boyz n the Hood\" director died Monday after having been in a coma for 12 days, following a stroke. Singleton\\'s family made an agonizing decision to remove him from life support. Stars flooded social media to pay tribute to Singleton, remembering him as an iconic director and a trailblazer in his industry. \"I was discovered by a master filmmaker by the name of John Singleton,\" Ice Cube, who starred in \"Boyz n the Hood,\" wrote on Twitter alongside a photo of the two at the Cannes Film Festival in the \\'90s. \"He not only made me a movie star but made me a filmmaker.

It is difficult to unravel this Gordian Knot to determine whether the company is actually a viable going concern or is simply a cash cow for insiders, but my unraveling attempts point to the latter.\\n\\nFor instance, from AR19 p. 44, SG&A as percentage of revenue decreased slightly, but this was due to a fee from Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), partially offset by other costs. Without that fee the SG&A numbers would not have been as favorable. The whole AR19 is replete with such back-and-forth data, so the financial future of the company remains obscure.\\n\\nMany have written or commented about mismanagement at RAD; I won\\'t go over old ground in that area. The question for investors is whether the company has reached a bottom (or, at least, a really big dip), or whether this is just another step on the downward staircase to further losses and possible dilution - again, I think it\\'s the latter.\\n\\nIn a sane world, the FTC would have approved the merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance several years ago. Any contention that this merger was anti-competitive is ludicrous, given the proliferation of pharmacies in supermarkets and the increasing promotion of mail-order prescriptions. Due to bureaucratic foot-dragging, the price of Rite Aid\\'s stock has plummeted well over 90%. Unfortunately, I don\\'t think it\\'s over.\\n\\nInsider trades provide no cause for optimism. Although there were some purchases (the share count of 155,844 seems oddly popular), these may have been motivated less by investment ardor for RAD than by a stock ownership guideline for directors.\\n\\nReimbursement Rates, Front-End Sales and Capex\\n\\nThe wailing and moaning from RAD management over the past years has focused on reimbursement rates as the main culprit for dismal financial performance. Let\\'s drill down into how these work, because some may not know.\\n\\nThe article here by RxSafe LLC describes reimbursement rates in some detail and is worth a read, although its main purpose is to tout their robotic prescription filler, RapidPakRx, and their patient marketing plan. The robot is alleged by the company to increase profits by 24% and have a one-year ROI. It is supposed to add 100 sq. ft. to the store from reduced inventory. It would be interesting to see a cost-benefit analysis of buying a robot instead of spending money on store remodeling. RxSafe doesn\\'t provide price information on their website or via their online chat, so that topic would require more in-depth research.\\n\\nThe RxSafe article linked above says that Medicaid (1/4) and Medicare (1/2) account for about three-fourths of all prescriptions. While that\\'s good in the short run, because the baby boomers are getting older and sicker, it\\'s bad in the long run, because the boomers will eventually die (sorry for being morbid), and then the demand should wane, absent population growth from immigration of the ill and elderly.\\n\\nIt does not appear that reimbursement rates will improve materially anytime soon; consequently, the status quo has to be managed. This can be done through better operations management, including correct staffing levels at the pharmacy level - yes, I mean mass layoffs, sad to say. Layoffs are more appropriate in pharmacies with large volumes of prescriptions and large staffs, where a one-person reduction is a smaller proportion of the total staff, and therefore has less impact on waiting times than it would in a smaller pharmacy with fewer employees. In my opinion, customers do not come to RAD because of low prescription prices, which are mostly paid by insurance anyway. They come because of geographical convenience, and will wait longer if they must.\\n\\nFront-end sales represent about a third of total revenues in the Retail Pharmacy segment. This appears to be the only area where genuine improvements can occur, unless pharmacy volumes increase significantly. My perspective is that RAD will never be viewed as the cheapest source in town for groceries and sundries. RAD is a convenience store. Efforts to compete on price with big box stores, except perhaps for certain items on sale, are futile and counterproductive. RAD should increase front-end prices across the board by 5%. This could make a dent in RAD\\'s ongoing losses. I suspect that any previous, relatively negligible, increase in front-end sales came at least partly from normal population increases and not any particular innovation from the company.\\n\\nI also have concerns about price points and product turn. Some prices for small items, such as tools, iPhone charging cables and other miscellany, are quite high. It might be better to use that shelf space for faster turning items or else reduce those margins to generate more sales. It would be worse if the actual supply source prices were too high, because that would imply that RAD is making poor sourcing decisions. By the way, who is the supplier of these items? Just wondering.\\n\\nAlthough remodeled stores are indeed customer-friendly, I have not seen a financial analysis of the performance of remodeled stores relative to the capex investment made. I have long questioned the wisdom of remodeling while the company remains unprofitable.\\n\\nIt would also be of interest to know whether the remodeling is done piecemeal with local contractors or through a single general contractor, how those lucrative contracts are awarded, and who has been getting them. Again, just wondering.\\n\\nNow there is hype about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) lockers (see here for review). Although this gimmick may possibly bring in a few new customers to the store, it is questionable whether the lockers are worth the shelf space they displace. This is not a unique offering, since people can pick up \"hold\" packages at UPS and FedEX partner locations, or indeed at other Amazon partner locations. It is not clear that this will generate big returns for RAD or will simply save customers the cost of a Post Office box while they do their shopping elsewhere, where prices may be lower. If lockers are a \"me, too\" competitive move, that\\'s fine, but let\\'s not call it an innovation or money maker until the results are in.\\n\\nFrom the recent conference call, I can discern no clear plan for a turnaround. There are the usual platitudes about progress, but there is no real financial progress other than pushing out the time for true financial distress a little longer. RAD no longer has the economies of scale it did in the past with more stores. Although admittedly RAD has a lower debt load than before, a flawed business model usually does not benefit from reduction in scope.\\n\\nSee here for a summary of FY 2019 fourth quarter report. Some tidbits appear that are not encouraging (bullets refer to prior full FY):\\n\\nDecline in reimbursement rates coming, without being offset by generics. Increase in rent expense due to new accounting method. Last year\\'s loss would have been worse except for a merger termination fee from Walgreens Boots Alliance. EBITDA would have been worse except for a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) fee from WBA. About 80 stores fewer than last year due to closings, of which 56 were closed in the fourth quarter. Retail pharmacy revenues were flat. Front-end sales decreased 1.4%\\n\\nGiven this somber report, I can only assume, as I have in the past, that RAD does not intend to survive as a going concern. The board of directors continues to remunerate executives - and themselves - for their lack of success. I believe the company is simply being groomed for a buyout, whether a la carte (by the store), as before, or in total. Recent modest reductions in staff to save money are too little, too late: a band-aid instead of a tourniquet.\\n\\nPharmacy Services Segment\\n\\nFrom AR19 p. 76, Pharmacy Services segment revenues have been in a tight range for the past three years. EBITDA is unfavorable. Here\\'s more detail from AR19 p. 34.\\n\\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was due primarily to an increase of $16.9 million in the Retail Pharmacy segment, partially offset by a decrease of $13.3 million in the Pharmacy Services segment.... The decrease in Pharmacy Services segment Adjusted EBITDA was driven by compression in our commercial business and other operating investments to support current year and future growth.\\n\\nGiven the competitive environment for Pharmacy Services, with Amazon entering the fray with its PillPack acquisition, it is difficult to project explosive growth for this segment. Any synergies expected from increased drug volume purchases by RAD as a consequence of acquiring EnvisionRx have already been baked in, after RAD\\'s long-term supply contract with McKesson (MCK). Presumably, there were better terms in this agreement than could have been obtained from the RAD\\'s foregone option to buy through the Walgreens Boots Alliance supplier, although that surprises me.\\n\\nThe Solution is Dilution\\n\\nIn the fine print on AR19 p. 51 is the following warning sign [emphasis mine]:\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may seek additional deleveraging or refinancing transactions, including entering into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock, issuance of equity (including preferred stock and convertible securities), repurchase or redemption of outstanding indebtedness, or seek to refinance our outstanding debt (including our Facilities) or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities, particularly following the Sale and implementation of our strategies following the termination of the Merger\\n\\nRAD\\'s \"New\" credit facilities limit the company in terms of accumulating cash. AR19 p. 46 says:\\n\\nThe New Facilities restrict us and all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the New Facilities and unsecured guaranteed notes (the \"Subsidiary Guarantors\") from accumulating cash on hand in excess of $200.0 million at any time when revolving loans are outstanding (not including cash located in our store and lockbox deposit accounts and cash necessary to cover our current liabilities).\\n\\nThis reduces RAD\\'s financial agility in terms of expansion, appearing to prohibit the company from expansion beyond its line of credit, such as using any windfall cash for acquisitions, without first paying down its debt. That\\'s not necessarily a bad thing, but it may encourage non-cash shenanigans, such as the issuance of stock rights, warrants, or other dilutive cash substitutes, printed by the company out of thin air.\\n\\nI have written in the past about the possibility of significant dilution, comparing it to \"death spiral financing,\" but have been criticized for that terminology in the RAD context, so I will avoid it here. However, I have seen other companies setting themselves up in a similar manner to what RAD is currently doing. The company has no loyalty to its existing shareholders. It can recapitalize and move on, as others have done. This is the major risk facing investors, and it isn\\'t mitigated by the company\\'s lowered leverage from its sales of stores to WBA.\\n\\nRAD has a little under 2,500 stores. It\\'s a moving target, since they continue to close certain stores. RAD has a debt of about $3.5 billion, give or take. WBA bought 2,186 stores and three distribution centers for $5.1 billion, according to USA Today. Or, if you believe a Forbes contributor, the numbers were a different: 1,932 stores for $4.4 billion. The transaction was a little complicated, so take your pick or peruse the SEC filings. Either way, it comes out to about $2.3 million per store (rounding up), disregarding the value of the distribution centers that WBA got as a bonus. So let\\'s say that in the best case, where RAD could get the same value today for each store, then about 2,500 times $2.3 million equals about $5.75 billion.\\n\\nSubtract the approximately $3.5 billion debt and we get net $2.25 billion. Divide by the number of outstanding shares (from Yahoo Finance), 52.89 million, equals $42.54, disregarding the Pharmacy Services segment and other assets that might push the price up more. This is the broad brush value per share if the stores are still worth that much. So why is the stock currently trading under $10? An inexplicably low stock price has been an issue ever since the Albertsons merger failed.\\n\\nOne factor may be diminishing company intrinsic value. According to one source, RAD has been selling corporate owned sites and leasing them back, often at market rates rather than more favorable terms. From AR19 p. 28:\\n\\nWe lease 2,338 of our operating drugstore facilities under non-cancelable leases, many of which have original terms of 10 to 22 years. In addition to minimum rental payments, which are set at competitive market rates, certain leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for taxes, maintenance and insurance. Most of our leases contain renewal options, some of which involve rent increases. The remaining 131 drugstore facilities are owned.\\n\\nSo there we have it. There is real estate value in 131 stores, a small fraction of the total. The only value for the vast majority of RAD stores at this point is their location and inventory. Since RAD isn\\'t profitable, let\\'s look at what a better managed company, say WBA, could expect to earn per store. From the WBA 2018 annual report p. 50, we see operating income for 9,569 U.S. stores at about $5 billion, or about $500k per store. While it is not unreasonable for a successful (meaning profitable) pharmacy chain to pay five times operating income for a good location, their alternative is to pay nothing and just obtain a newly available lease from new buildings in expanding suburban locations. Therefore, it is difficult to know how much RAD would get for their leasehold locations if they attempted to sell the company now. I would certainly expect an eventual buyout offer for RAD\\'s city center locations, but I wonder whether locations without a captive audience will have much appeal.\\n\\nThe market is forward-looking. Even at $1 million per store upon buyout, the stock price should be over $20. Therefore, the market may know something we don\\'t. What could be a reason why a company\\'s stock price reflects only a fraction of its putative liquidation value? One possibility is anticipation of eventual dilution. If someone has another answer, please post it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the executives and board of directors get rich. The company lurches along, its value gradually diminishing, and the opportunists may await an anticipated dilution so they can scoop up the company for pennies on the dollar and make a tidy profit as the old shareholders, like old soldiers, just fade away.\\n\\nRAD remains a sell, in my view. It may trade up or down 20% due to the usual bear or bull raids, but I see no short-term catalysts for huge price spikes or dips. Those who choose to hold are betting on the arbitrage from a future buyout, not organic growth, and I don\\'t attach much premium to such a buyout, given the dubious Albertsons offer and the absence of other offers subsequently. Consolidation in the brick and mortar pharmacy sector is inevitable, so a buyout should eventually take place, but the longer it takes, the more RAD\\'s stock price may continue to erode, absent management improvement. Unless RAD can recruit a strong and effective leader, like Bausch Health (BHC) - formerly Valeant - did by hiring Joseph Papa, I don\\'t see a turnaround coming, because existing management has had plenty of time and hasn\\'t executed.\\n\\nThe major downside risk continues to be dilution, and I believe that risk is substantial over the long term. Do your own due diligence.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

But more than that, they strike at the heart of Facebook\\'s business model -- its vaunted ability to deliver ads with surgical precision to certain groups of people and not others.\\n\\n\"Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live,\" HUD Secretary Ben Carson said. \"Using a computer to limit a person\\'s housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone\\'s face.\"\\n\\nIn a statement, Facebook expressed surprise over the charges, saying it has been working with HUD to address its concerns and has taken steps to prevent discrimination, including eliminating thousands of ad-targeting options last year that could be misused by advertisers.\\n\\nJust last week, Facebook agreed to overhaul its targeting system and abandon some of the practices singled out by HUD to prevent discrimination, not just in housing listings but in credit and employment ads as well. The move was part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists.\\n\\n\"We\\'re disappointed by today\\'s developments, but we\\'ll continue working with civil rights experts on these issues,\" the company said.\\n\\nThe HUD charges were seen as a possible prelude to a wider regulatory crackdown on the digital advertising industry, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. And the case was yet another blow to Facebook, which has come under siege from lawmakers, regulators and activists and is under investigation in the U.S. and Europe over its data and privacy practices.\\n\\nHUD spokesman Brian Sullivan said the agency has reached out to Google and Twitter to \"better understand their advertising practices.\" But he said neither is currently under investigation. Twitter says it doesn\\'t allow discriminatory advertising, while Google says its policies prohibit targeting ads based on sensitive categories such as race, ethnicity and religious beliefs.\\n\\nGoogle, in particular, has ad-targeting options similar to Facebook\\'s.\\n\\nThe technology at the center of the clash with HUD has helped make Facebook rich, with annual revenue of close to $56 billion. Facebook gathers enormous amounts of data on what users read and like and who their friends are, and it uses that information to help advertisers and others direct their messages to exactly the crowd they want to reach.\\n\\nHUD said Facebook is allowing advertisers to practice a sort of high-tech form of red-lining by excluding people in entire neighborhoods or ZIP codes from seeing their ads. The company was accused, too, of giving advertisers the option of showing ads only to men or only to women.\\n\\nFacebook also allegedly allowed advertisers to exclude parents; those who are non-American-born; non-Christians; and those interested in Hispanic culture, \"deaf culture,\" accessibility for the disabled, countries like Honduras or Somalia, or a variety of other topics.\\n\\nThe case will be heard by an administration law judge unless HUD or Facebook decides to move it to federal court.\\n\\n\"The nature of their business model is advertising and targeted advertising, so that is a slippery slope. That is their business model,\" said Dan Ives, an industry analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"The government launched this missile and caught many in the industry by surprise.\"\\n\\nIves said the move may mean U.S. regulators are taking broader aim at the digital advertising market. \"This is a clear shot across the bow for Facebook and others,\" he said.\\n\\nGalen Sherwin of the ACLU likewise warned: \"All the online platforms should be paying close attention to these lawsuits and taking a hard look at their own advertising platforms.\"\\n\\nFacebook is already under fire for allowing fake Russian accounts to buy ads targeting U.S. users and sow political discord during the 2016 presidential election. The company has also been criticized for allowing organizations to target groups of people identified as \"Jew-haters\" and Nazi sympathizers.\\n\\nHUD brought an initial complaint against Facebook in August.

The new number: nearly 24 million.\\n\\n\"It was certainly a shock,\" Morris tells The Daily Beast, though she doesn\\'t exactly sound surprised. But as she continues, it becomes clear this was a big deal. \"Breaking that record proves to myself, the industry and my label that you don\\'t have to choose between the critical acclaim side of a career and the commercial aspect.\"\\n\\nFor an artist as successful as Morris, it is surprising she felt conflicted -- or rather, expected to feel at odds -- with her career. First gaining critical acclaim and a Grammy for her debut album Hero, Morris reached crossover success just a year and a half later with the song of 2018, \"The Middle.\" The contagious track featuring Zedd and Grey was heard as often on the radio as it still is in the aisles of Target.\\n\\nIn the three years since Hero, each headline, review or interview was almost always accompanied with a question: would she make the leap to Top 40 pop or recede back into country? Morris won\\'t go so far as to call the genre interrogations frustrating. Having spent her formative Nashville years as a songwriter for Kelly Clarkson and Jessie James Decker, she understands radio stations -- the backbone of country music -- need to know where to slot her. But, frankly, it is a bit tiring. \"I don\\'t exactly understand the whole carpetbagging \\'You\\'re abandoning your genre behind to go be a pop star\\' front,\" she says, once again with little inflection. \"I\\'ve never claimed to be any of those things.\"\\n\\nOn Girl, Morris offers a time capsule of the modern countrywoman. She opens with the title track, \"Girl,\" an instant, soulful rebuke to country stations, media outlets and even fellow singers trying to pit her against other female country artists. She adds, \"I always think about the scene in Mean Girls, where Lindsay Lohan wins Spring Fling Queen and she ends up breaking the plastic crown apart and throwing it into the crowd.\" Minutes later, on the twangy tune \"A Song for Everything,\" she recalls her high school days of getting drunk and smoking weed while listening to Bruce Springsteen and Katy Perry\\'s \"Teenage Dream.\" Morris says that tune \"was born out of a Tiki bar conversation with my co-writers.\"\\n\\nShe\\'s come a long way since those early Hero days, when the country pop star rocked long honey curls and sang with a distinct twang about driving her \"80s Mercedes\" down the highway blasting Johnny Cash. Now she\\'s straddling a silver foldable metal chair at her live shows with a sleek lob while telling her husband and fellow musician Ryan Hurd to get his ass home on the 90s R&B girl group-inspired track \"RSVP\" because she \"ain\\'t wearing nothing / nothing you can\\'t take off me.\" It\\'s a standard -- demure even -- sentiment compared to most pop stars. But it\\'s almost unprecedented in country, where Morris is bringing female sexuality to a genre often focused on women as sex objects.\\n\\nBut don\\'t expect her to go full \"Partition\"-style Beyoncé with backup dancers, intricate light shows or cinematic stage videos. \"I\\'m not this choreography queen,\" she says. For her 40-show Girl tour, instead of picking some fork in the road between pop and country, she is blazing an entirely new path. Her Nashville songwriter roots show in the sparse stage arrangement: an acoustic guitar and live band, while she highlights herself as an \"artist becoming more and more confident and into herself\" with rainforest-scented smoke, cotton candy-scented bubbles and an expansive neon purple staircase. It\\'s there on stage that Morris establishes what kind of artist she is. \"The period at the end of the genre battle sentence is just to look at the crowd,\" she says.\\n\\nMorris attracts an audience beyond straight men in cowboy hats and girls in jean shorts. Suddenly -- finally -- her voice bursts with excitement as she recalls one particularly devoted fan from the kickoff show for her first national tour in early 2017 at New York City\\'s Bowery Ballroom. \"There was this gay guy in the front that had choreographed moves for every single song,\" she says, letting out an infectious laugh.\\n\\nWhile pop stars like Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez are often expected to be vocally supportive of the LGBT community, it\\'s not a job requirement for country artists. Those that do, like Kacey Musgraves and Jennifer Nettles, are rightfully praised for it. Maren joined their camp years ago. \"There was really no difference between my gay friends and me,\" she said of her high school friends. \"We would all goof off in musical theater together.\"\\n\\nNow as a record-breaking, award-winning artist, she\\'s only become a bigger advocate. \"So much of this is about action and not just a cute caption or phrase in an article that people latch onto,\" she says. It\\'s not a groundbreaking sentiment: Practice what you preach. But in a genre where critiquing President Bush infamously killed the Dixie Chicks\\' career for a time -- which Morris references on the defiant \"Flavor\" -- it\\'s notable that Morris wears a shirt sprawled with the word \"Feminist\" at a faux-Women\\'s March in her \"Girl\" music video. That\\'s her \"cute caption,\" a simple statement of support. But, make no mistake, she\\'s followed it up with action.\\n\\n\"Common\" is one of just two collaboration tracks on Girl, featuring Americana singer Brandi Carlile. Morris was adamant about having another female duet on her album. \"There needs to be way more of them,\" she says, having grown up listening to both \"The Boy Is Mine\" by Brandy and Monica as well as \"When You Believe\" by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.\\n\\nCarlile, herself experiencing a big year following what Morris likens to a her \"A Star Is Born\" performance at this year\\'s Grammys, is an out lesbian finding success in the country genre and, as of recently, a new pal to Morris. \"We\\'ve struck up this great, positive friendship over the last year,\" Morris says. She remembers having dinner alongside her husband Ryan and Carlile\\'s wife Catherine Stephard. They discussed Ryan and Morris\\' recent wedding, Catherine and Carlile\\'s two daughters and the fear that Catherine, who is English, could be extradited due to the Trump administration\\'s unstable immigration policies. Morris, who grew up in the \"very Southern conservative\" city of Arlington, Texas, was viscerally moved by her new friend\\'s story. \"Talking about that just really opens my eyes even more to the privilege us straight people have that we don\\'t think about until you really hear another account for it,\" she says.\\n\\nOf all the points to discuss with Morris, from the new album to the Girl tour to her record-breaking week, it\\'s her advocacy that she ponders the most. She doesn\\'t give terse answers, per se, though she doesn\\'t always have \"any new revelatory statement\" to answer routine questions with. But that\\'s Morris\\' strength. No matter what she sings about, what she stands for or who she is, Morris is \"always going to be the one with the megaphone talking about it,\" she says. Then she admits, \"Anyways, I\\'m rambling.\" And thank God she is.', 'source': {'uri': 'thedailybeast.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Beast'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'joseph_longo@thedailybeast.com', 'name': 'Joseph Longo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1553271683/190320-Longo-Maren-Morris-intv-tease_eppz0g', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1215686274509804, 'wgt': 11}\n",

He urged supporters to call on their members of Congress to ratify a trade deal his administration negotiated with Mexico and Canada, saying it would help prevent jobs from leaving the U.S. and going to those countries.\\n\\nOn immigration, Trump said he\\'s sending migrants caught crossing the southern border into the U.S. to so-called sanctuary cities -- most of them Democratic strongholds -- if they can no longer be legally detained. \"I\\'m proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea,\" he said.\\n\\nWisconsin has earned particular notoriety after Trump\\'s 2016 opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, didn\\'t campaign in the state during the general election. The Democratic National Committee scheduled its 2020 convention in Milwaukee.\\n\\nFor Trump, the state offers a potentially tricky referendum on his economic record.

It is not, however, a democracy. Citizens have never had the power to choose their top leader, neither as part of China since 1997 nor as an outpost of the British Empire for 156 years before that. In 2014, the prospect of the first direct election of Hong Kong\\'s leader, or \"chief executive,\" increased the tension between a yearning for autonomy and China\\'s demand for loyalty, triggering 79 days of street protests. That strain is ever-present in Hong Kong politics, while the kind of democracy that protesters demanded remains as elusive as ever.\\n\\nThe Situation\\n\\nEight democracy activists were sentenced in April 2019 to as much as 16 months in prison on charges stemming from the 2014 protests, a sign of how determined the China-backed local government has been to punish the organizers. The protests were sparked by Beijing\\'s insistence on vetting candidates for the chief executive post, which demonstrators saw as backtracking from a pledge to move toward universal suffrage, or letting everyone vote. Tens of thousands of outraged students and their supporters blocked major arteries under the banner \"Occupy Central.\" It became known as the \"Umbrella Movement\" after police fired tear gas at demonstrators, who defended themselves with umbrellas. The protest eventually fizzled. The 2017 election was decided by a 1,163-member committee dominated by China loyalists, which chose then-Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying\\'s deputy Carrie Lam to succeed him. After elections to the city legislature in 2016 generated a surge in support for pro-democracy candidates, six of the winners were subsequently disqualified, weakening the opposition\\'s ability to block legislation. Other pro-democracy activists including Agnes Chow, a prominent student leader in 2014, have been banned from running for legislative office. In a rare move, the Hong Kong Immigration Department in 2018 refused to renew a U.K. journalist\\'s work visa after he hosted a talk by pro-independence activist Andy Chan at the city\\'s Foreign Correspondents\\' Club. The government also banned Chan\\'s party after that speech.\\n\\nThe Background\\n\\nThe 1984 Sino-British power transfer agreement specified that China would give Hong Kong a \"high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years under a principle the Chinese call \"one country, two systems.\" Any talk of independence was on the fringes: More than 90 percent of the city\\'s nearly 7.5 million residents are ethnic Chinese with family ties to the mainland, which provides most of Hong Kong\\'s water and food as well as about half its trade. The city\\'s top official was to be chosen by an intricate nominating process that, in the view of democracy advocates, puts Beijing in control. It hasn\\'t worked out well: The chief executives have lacked popular support, with the first one, Tung Chee-hwa, departing after protests and his successor, Donald Tsang, amid a financial scandal that led to a conviction.\\n\\nThe Argument\\n\\nThough the public tired of the 2014 occupation, the students claim that they emboldened citizens to demand democracy and that there is still support for universal suffrage that meets what they call \"international standards.\" Pro-Beijing groups argue that China never promised more than the limited form of universal suffrage it offered, and that the occupation damaged Hong Kong\\'s rule of law and standing in the international financial community. China\\'s wariness of Hong Kong\\'s democracy movement is consistent with its wider push to assert regional control and to redress the humiliation it says it suffered after ceding the city to Britain upon losing the first Opium War in 1841.

It is one of a handful of current projects that total $1 billion to replace existing barriers and build new ones across the border.\\n\\nHere are questions and answers about the various barriers along the border and those that are in the works as Trump attempts to carry out his signature campaign promise.\\n\\nWHAT\\'S ALREADY THERE?\\n\\nThe southern border is nearly 2,000 miles long and already has about 650 miles of different types of barriers, including short vehicle barricades and tall, steel fences that go up to 30 feet high. Most of the fencing was built during the administration of George W. Bush, and there have been updates and maintenance throughout other administrations.\\n\\nWHAT HAS TRUMP DONE?\\n\\nTrump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border. His administration has only replaced existing fencing, including the section he is touring Friday.\\n\\nConstruction for that small chunk of fencing cost about $18 million, began in February 2018 and was completed in October. Plans to replace that fence date back to 2009, during the beginning of former President Barack Obama\\'s tenure.\\n\\nContractors have been doing site and preparation work for 13 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley that will be Trump\\'s first new fencing. The administration said construction could begin as early as this week. The administration is also in the process of replacing 14 miles of fencing around San Diego.\\n\\n\"The wall is under construction, by the way, large sections. We\\'re going to be meeting, I think on Friday, at a piece of the wall that we\\'ve completed, a big piece, a lot of it\\'s being built right now,\" he told reporters Thursday. \"It\\'s moving along very nicely. But we need the wall.\"\\n\\nWHAT ABOUT THOSE PROTOTYPES?\\n\\nEarly in his term, Trump called for prototypes of border walls that were built in the San Diego area at a cost of about $300,000 to $500,000 each. Eight prototypes went up, and Trump traveled to the border to inspect them last year.\\n\\nBut they were demolished in February. The nearly $3 billion that Congress provided for barriers during the first half of Trump\\'s term requires the money be spent on designs that were in place before May 2017, which meant the prototypes couldn\\'t be used.\\n\\nThe prototypes became a spectacle at various times since Trump took office, drawing tourists, protesters and artists who projected light shows on the walls from Mexico.\\n\\nWHAT ABOUT THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY?\\n\\nTrump shut down the federal government for more than a month -- the longest shutdown in U.S. history -- and later declared a national emergency to free up billions of dollars to build his wall. Congress had voted to block the emergency declaration but Trump vetoed the measure.\\n\\nSeveral organizations brought lawsuits over the declaration, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats also planned on suing to prevent Trump from \"stealing\" money from federal programs and diverting the money to build a wall.\\n\\nBut the national emergency money has not yet been spent in part because the government has to first spend existing border wall funding. A lawsuit could eventually derail the plan.\\n\\nStill, various plans for more border barriers are moving along.\\n\\nLast month, the Department of Homeland Security requested that the defense department build 57 miles of 18-foot fencing near Yuma, Arizona and El Paso, Texas, which have seen enormous increases in the number of border crossers, especially families.', 'source': {'uri': 'abcnews.go.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@abcnews.go.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_69dc02a520b84f0d81b43407bf9fc48c_16x9_992.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'wgt': 9}\n",

Even the filing was big, at 368 pages. The company could sell $10 billion in stock valuing it at $100 billion, making it far and away the biggest of the \"unicorns\" -- private companies worth $1 billion or more -- to sell tickets to the public. All very exciting, but also more than a little risky, writes Shira Ovide: This stock is a long-term bet on a company that has lost money for a decade. It\\'s sprawling, with many possible ways to make money, but if or when that happens is anybody\\'s guess.\\n\\nOne investor with much, uh, riding on this is SoftBank Vision Fund, which owns 16 percent of Uber, a stake it bought relatively late in the game. Tim Culpan notes this is the first significant chance for Masayoshi Son\\'s big investment vehicle to cash in on a unicorn IPO, but the journey could be stomach-churning.\\n\\nWith all the hype around Uber, retail investors will be tempted to jump on board. In fact, the ride-sharing company, its rival Lyft Inc. and other unprofitable unicorns are hitting the public market at the perfect time for them, writes Nir Kaissar: Investor hunger for high-priced, money-losing companies is high. History suggests it will end badly. But enjoy the ride.\\n\\nFurther Uber reading:\\n\\nSpeaking of big numbers, oil major Chevron Corp. is further en-majoring itself with a $33 billion deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp., a 39 percent premium to Anadarko\\'s share price. It\\'s a big bet on the shale business. But it\\'s also a relative bargain for Chevron, writes Liam Denning: Anadarko\\'s stock hasn\\'t kept up with the surge in oil prices, a problem for many companies in the shale patch. Its investors now get to enjoy Chevron\\'s scale and \"a bigger, better-positioned version of what they had anyway.\"\\n\\nIn another relative bargain with an 11-figure price tag, Bristol Myers Squibb & Co. now has approval to buy cancer-drug maker Celgene Corp. for $74 billion. Starboard and other investors didn\\'t like the deal and tried to stop it, but they failed in a shareholder vote on Friday. Max Nisen says the approval is a good thing: Both companies still face uncertainty about their blockbuster drugs and pipelines. But together they have more ways to succeed.\\n\\nFurther deal reading:\\n\\nAmerica\\'s institutions have mostly stood up to President Donald Trump so far, though some are better equipped than others to handle his unique challenges. On the issue of the release of his tax returns, for example, tradition dictates Trump release them, but, ha ha, \"tradition.\" Democrats have demanded his administration produce the returns, but that\\'s also futile, writes Bloomberg\\'s editorial board. The courts are best placed to settle this issue, and Dems should get their request moving through them ASAP. Then we need better laws on presidential disclosure.\\n\\nMeanwhile, even as he rails against illegal immigration, Trump and his family profit from illegal migrant labor, according to many, many reports. Typically, the Department of Homeland Security might investigate such a thing, but with Stephen Miller currently in charge, again, ha ha, observes Tim O\\'Brien. This is one area where Congress must take the lead.\\n\\nBonus editorials:\\n\\nMarkets spent several months freaking out about a coming recession, but lately there have been reasons to wonder if they overdid it. For one thing, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\'s earnings report this morning described consumer spending as strong to very strong, note Brian Chappatta and Elisa Martinuzzi. Can\\'t really have a recession when the biggest driver of the U.S. economy is doing fine.\\n\\nEurope, meanwhile, has clearly been in bad shape. But lately economic data in chronically weak Italy have rebounded, notes Ferdinando Giugliano, offering the whole continent a much-needed lift.\\n\\nSo much for the lost decade: Japan is doing all the right things, including boosting immigration, to overcome its shrinking population and keep the economy growing, writes Noah Smith.\\n\\nHerman Cain may not end up on the Fed, but Stephen Moore still might, and he\\'s got some dangerous policy ideas. - Ramesh Ponnuru\\n\\nGenerals are trying to take power in Sudan, Algeria and Libya.

Most of the focus was on how investors submitted orders for about $60 billion of bonds. Even if you are (rightly) skeptical of \"order books\" and think the true demand was for half that amount, it\\'s still a remarkable development for a country that just a few months ago was being ostracized for its role in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. But there\\'s more to the story.\\n\\nIn essence, the high demand is a referendum on the oil market. Investors are really looking to jump into the deal because they think that oil prices, which are up more than 50 percent from the lows in December, are headed much higher. Rising oil prices are generally not a problem for markets during times of economic strength, but the majority of analysts expect weaker growth, with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development having just slashed its global forecast for this year to 3.3 percent from a previous estimate of 3.5 percent. Higher crude prices could act as a further drag on the economy and weigh on riskier financial assets. In the U.S., for example, prices for a gallon of regular grade gasoline have risen to an average of $2.74 heading into the all-important summer driving season, according to the Automobile Association of America, up from January\\'s low of $2.23 a gallon. Prices are in sight of the $2.90 a gallon seen in early October right before personal spending took a dive and equity markets collapsed. Some might say that higher oil prices indicate an economy that isn\\'t as bad as thought, but the reality is they probably have more to do with a decline in the supplies, thanks to OPEC.\\n\\nOPEC and its partners, which pump about half of the world\\'s oil, have been successful in cutting in production to get oil back to near the levels they need to cover government spending, according to Bloomberg News\\'s Grant Smith. On top of that, there\\'s now concern that an escalating conflict in Libya, whose oil is prized for its quality, could cause crude supplies to tighten further. \"The expectation that the tightened supply picture is going to boost prices is starting\" to gain traction, said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst at Tradition Energy, according to Bloomberg News.\\n\\nBOND BULLS FACE CRITICAL WEEK\\n\\nPerhaps it was the potential negative effect of rising oil prices on the global economy that prompted bond investors to step up at the U.S. Treasury Department\\'s auction of super-safe bills on Monday. The offering of $42 billion of three-month bills attracted bids for 3.07 times the amount offered, the most since January. The offering of $36 billion in six-month bills generated a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.14, the highest since February. Relatively high-yielding cash equivalents such as Treasury bills should see demand in an uncertain economic environment like the one the U.S. currently faces. Plus, the market is pricing in about a 100 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points this year. Regardless, this is a big week for the world\\'s most important market. Besides the regular bill auctions, the Treasury Department will offer $78 billion in three-, 10- and 30-year notes and bonds. In addition, the government on Wednesday will release the monthly Consumer Price Index report for March -- which is forecast to show faster inflation, in part because of rising oil and gas prices -- and the Fed will release the minutes of its March monetary policy meeting the same day. \"For the market to begin pricing in a hike, we will need to see persistent inflation pressures,\" said Noelle Corum, a portfolio manager in the fixed-income group at Invesco Advisers Inc., according to Bloomberg News.\\n\\nA PRUDENT STOCK BEAR\\'S WARNING\\n\\nIn the second and third quarters of last year, when U.S. stocks were flying higher, Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson wasn\\'t impressed. Wilson stuck to his call that the S&P 500 Index would end that year at 2,750 even as the benchmark jumped above 2,900 and the median estimate among 25 Wall Street strategists surveyed by Bloomberg rose to 3,000. Everyone knows what happened next, as the S&P 500 began a long tumble that pushed it down to around 2,500 at the end of last year. In short, Wilson was right to be skeptical, and his views haven\\'t really changed even though the S&P 500 rebounded to 2,891 on Monday. His year-end forecast is still 2,750, and his reasoning is sound. As Wilson puts it, the recent gains were mainly due to the notion that bad economic news would be good for riskier assets by forcing the Fed to put its rate-hike plans on hold. But that trade is played out. \"Unlike in January, I doubt bad fundamental news will be good for stocks any more, given significantly higher valuations today and the fact that the Fed can\\'t pivot any further at this point without signaling rate cuts,\" Wilson wrote in a Sunday research note. \"Historically, the first rate cut is a red flag for stocks because it portends even weaker growth, rather than the positive inflection point that comes from a pause.\" Wilson adds that the Fed \"has fixed\" the tight financial conditions that sparked the sell-off. \"However, it can\\'t roll back the corporate cost pressures created by the fiscal stimulus\" and \"these pressures now have to play out in what we\\'ve been calling for since last fall -- a profits recession.\"\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT WHO CRIED WOLF\\n\\nTime was when President Donald Trump could rattle the peso with a tweet or an off-the-cuff remark criticizing Mexico over trade or its handling of immigrants passing through that country on their way to the U.S.\\'s southern border. No more. The peso gained on Monday despite broader weakness in emerging-market currencies and threats by Trump over the weekend to close the border with its southern neighbor \"and/or\" tariffs. The peso appreciated as much as 0.84 percent on Monday, strengthening below 19 a dollar in its fourth intraday gain and becoming the biggest driver of the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index\\'s decline. The moves suggest that traders are starting to ignore Trump\\'s repeated threats against Mexico, having seemingly made contradictory remarks about potential tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican-made cars and a border closing. As Bloomberg News\\'s Sebastian Boyd points out, a lot of U.S. car companies such as Ford, Chysler and General Motors use factories in Mexico, and any tariffs like the one Trump has threatened could harm the U.S. economy. Plus, Mexican auto-parts suppliers such as Metalsa, which makes the chassis for the Chevy Colorado, Chrysler Ram and Ford F-150 pickup trucks, also have plants in the U.S. Tariff-induced pain could also cause them to cut back there, hurting jobs. Mexico\\'s stock market is also starting to hum, with the benchmark Bolsa IPC rising on Monday to its highest level since November.\\n\\nISRAELI INVESTORS ARE BECALMED\\n\\nGiven Israel\\'s strategic Middle East location and geopolitical influence, elections there are always an important event. The stakes are higher than usual in this week\\'s elections, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing the possibility of being indicted for fraud and bribery and, as Bloomberg Opinion contributor Pankaj Mishra puts it, Israel\\'s traditional support base in the U.S. showing signs of weakness as a more outspoken left seeks to reshape foreign policy. And yet, investors appear unfazed. The shekel has steadily appreciated this year, gaining 4.30 percent in one of the world\\'s best performances against the dollar. The benchmark Tel Aviv Stock Exchange 35 Index has gained more than 7 percent this year. All this even though the Bank of Israel\\'s research department on Monday cut its growth forecast for this year to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent, predicting exports would underperform amid sluggish global trade. Even so, that\\'s not so bad and the central bank is in an accommodating mood, deciding to keep interest rates at an ultralow 0.25 percent. \"We think that the window for rate hikes in Israel is rapidly closing,\" Guy Beit-Or, head of macro research at Psagot Investment House Ltd., wrote in a research note. \"In the likely event of rate cuts in the U.S. and around the world in 2020, we don\\'t see a scenario in which the BOI will hike.\"\\n\\nTEA LEAVES\\n\\nThe National Federation of Independent Business\\'s monthly index of sentiment among U.S. small-business owners had fallen for five straight months through January before showing a small gain for February. So, was that increase the start of a new upswing or a just a pause on the way to a deeper slide? Markets will get some answers Tuesday when the next report is due. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for another small rise, to 102 from 101.7 in February. But that would still keep the gauge a long way from the 35-year high of 108.8 in August. \"Companies in this segment have recently become cautious about taking on new workers, a trend also reflected in the recent ADP private-hiring data by company size,\" Bloomberg Economics noted in a research note Monday. \"Such vigilance could have been related to uncertainty surrounding small business owners\\' expectations for 2018 tax refunds, and will likely be temporary.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'robert_burgess@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Robert Burgess', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/itN7CSpxZDSs/v1/1200x800.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.1529411764705882, 'wgt': 8}\n",

Whether he can do much to solve the sector\\'s intractable problems, many of which are beyond his control, remains to be seen.\\n\\nKenney\\'s bid to reinvigorate Alberta\\'s oil industry -- which has suffered from a chronic pipeline shortage that\\'s led to low crude prices and a dearth of international investment -- will have national and global implications. The province churns out about four-fifths of Canada\\'s oil, an industry that accounts for 10 percent of the nation\\'s economy and 20 percent of its exports. The province\\'s 3.7 million barrels of daily production put it roughly on par with the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n\"We mean business -- we\\'re no longer going to roll over and apologize and accept policies that damage our economy,\" Kenney, 50, a former federal cabinet minister who leads the newly formed UCP, told reporters in Calgary on Tuesday. Most polls give Kenney a comfortable lead over Premier Rachel Notley and her New Democratic Party for the April 16 vote.\\n\\nKenney\\'s biggest challenge will be to get a pipeline built to ensure the increased oil-sands production planned for the next 50 years can get to market. Though he\\'s lashed out at Notley for failing to make much progress on new lines, the reality is that Canada hasn\\'t had a major crude oil pipeline built in about a decade. Notley is hardly the only one to blame.\\n\\nTransCanada\\'s Corp.\\'s Keystone XL has been stalled for a decade by environmental protests and lawsuits in the U.S., while its Energy East project to the Atlantic Coast was dropped after opposition in Quebec. Kinder Morgan Inc., meanwhile, abandoned its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to the Pacific Coast due to protests and legal challenges in British Columbia. Justin Trudeau\\'s government stepped in to buy it last year, though little progress has been made.\\n\\nDespite Kenney\\'s fiery claims to get a pipeline built for Alberta, in the end it requires federal approval through the National Energy Board, not to mention tacit approval from other provinces, cities and indigenous groups.\\n\\n\"The biggest thing is always pipelines, and for that you need the federal government and the provinces to cooperate,\" Laura Lau, who helps manage C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto, said in an interview. \"That\\'s the No. 1 issue, and there\\'s only so much Alberta can do on its own.\"\\n\\nKenney is counting on a new pipeline to revive investment in the sector, which plunged by almost half between 2014 and 2017, as Canadian firms curbed spending and foreign operators including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Marathon Oil Corp. pulled out in favor of lower-cost, lower-emissions areas.\\n\\nThe UCP election platform released last week says a Kenney government\\'s first bill will scrap the C$30-a-ton carbon tax Notley implemented after her surprise victory in 2015. He estimates the repeal will amount to a C$1.4 billion tax cut that will create jobs, save families money and put Alberta\\'s energy sector on a level playing field with other jurisdictions.\\n\\nIf Trudeau\\'s federal government imposes a carbon tax on Alberta, as it has in other provinces that haven\\'t put forth their own plan, Kenney plans to sue to stop the imposition.\\n\\nEven here, Kenney\\'s power to make changes will be limited. Other provinces in the same situation, including Ontario and Manitoba, have pledged to take the Trudeau government to court. In the meantime, consumers in those regions started paying a carbon tax on April 1.\\n\\nKenney\\'s platform acknowledges energy industry emissions are contributing to climate change and says his party is committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. His solution is to require large emitters to reduce intensity by 10 percent, purchase credits from other facilities or pay into a fund to develop emissions-reducing technologies.\\n\\nKenney -- who served as immigration minister under Stephen Harper\\'s Conservative government from 2008 to 2013 -- is also threatening to have Alberta cease doing business with banks that boycott energy projects, cut oil shipments to provinces that fight pipeline development, and press Trudeau to kill Bill C-69, which overhauls the approval process for pipelines.\\n\\nIf the bill isn\\'t scrapped and if there isn\\'t substantial progress on the construction of a pipeline to the coast, Kenney plans to hold a referendum on removing equalization payments from the Constitution Act. Never mind that so-called equalization payments, in which the government in Ottawa transfers money to poorer provinces, is a federal program.\\n\\nKenney\\'s ire won\\'t be aimed solely at Trudeau. His C$30 million \"war room\" will combat misinformation about Alberta\\'s energy industry, and his government will challenge the charitable status of groups that campaign against the sector.\\n\\nWhile most of those proposals will find easy support in the industry, he may receive push back on one idea: scrapping the current government\\'s plan to invest C$3.7 billion to add 120,000 barrels of crude-by-rail capacity. Kenney says the private market will invest to solve the problem and that the government shouldn\\'t risk taxpayer money.\\n\\nDeloitte analyst Andrew Botterill said last week that scrapping the plan could cause a drop in local heavy crude prices, which have gained almost 90 percent this year to more than $55 a barrel, near the highest in almost a year.\\n\\n\"Wider spreads for Western Canada Select crude and an easing of Alberta production cuts will be needed to drive growth in Canadian crude-by-rail volume in 2019.\"\\n\\n--Lee Klaskow, Adam Roszkowski, transportation analysts\\n\\nClick here to view the piece.\\n\\nNotley says Kenney\\'s plan imperils Alberta\\'s energy industry by isolating it from the rest of the country. She plans to continue pushing for changes to Bill C-69, pressing the federal government to speed construction of the Trans Mountain expansion and encouraging more local refining and upgrading.\\n\\n\"When you are leading a province, when you have an obligation to represent all people in the province, you need to take a determined, informed, strategic, forceful approach to advocating your position,\" Notley, 54, said in Calgary on Tuesday.\\n\\nBeyond the energy industry, Kenney plans to cut the business tax rate to 8 percent from 12 percent over four years. Even while cutting taxes and maintaining operating spending at current levels, he plans to balance the budget within his first term. Alberta is projected to run a C$6.93 billion deficit for the fiscal year that just ended.\\n\\nLau said most energy industry executives probably would prefer a Kenney victory because he might cut regulations and speed approvals for new oil wells. The Brompton portfolio manager is skeptical either leader can dramatically improve the situation for the sector, which has been battered by forces beyond Alberta\\'s borders.\\n\\n\"If it appears Alberta is a friendlier place to do business, that should help,\" Lau said. \"But even if approvals for wells are faster, there\\'s no point if you can\\'t put in a pipeline.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'kevin_orland@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Kevin Orland', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i1V.uAVkiP3M/v0/1200x800.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4713862', 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 8}\n",

Is there a reporter, photographer or editor whom you would like to get to know? Tell us in the form below.\\n\\nWhen Jose Del Real joined the ranks of The Times\\'s California correspondents last year, the job was a homecoming of sorts for him. Born in the Central Valley to Mexican immigrants, Jose and his family left the state when he was a baby and moved to Alaska. He then went east for college and became a political reporter in Washington.\\n\\nBased in Los Angeles now, he zigzags across California covering some of today\\'s most significant domestic stories, as varied as wildfires, shootings and the opioid crisis.\\n\\n[Read Jose\\'s recent article about transgender women living on the border between the United States and Mexico.]\\n\\nHere, Jose talks about the demands of his work, his message for aspiring journalists of color and the magic of a daily solo dance party.\\n\\nWhat do you enjoy most about being a National correspondent? What is most challenging about it?\\n\\nSometimes there are these moments of vulnerability and honesty that happen in reporting, when the people I\\'m interviewing feel comfortable enough to open up about their lives. That is always an amazing gift and comes with a lot of responsibility. Those conversations make my work feel like a vocation. My job is about truth and, at the highest level, empathy. Everyone has a story that matters; some people are just never asked to share it.\\n\\nThis job can be tough, though. As correspondents, our weeks and months can be unpredictable because we have to balance longer-term projects with breaking news. One week in November, to give an extreme example, my fellow California reporters and I went from covering the midterms on Tuesday, to a horrific shooting on Wednesday night, to wildfires on Thursday. There\\'s thematic whiplash, and it\\'s emotionally heavy. Our editors provide crucial support while we\\'re in the thick of it.\\n\\nAnd balancing work with my personal life can feel surreal at times. One Saturday during the wildfires, my partner, Patrick, found an open afternoon to propose after scouting a good day for weeks. By Monday I was on the southern border for a story.\\n\\nDo you ever feel emotionally overwhelmed when you\\'re reporting on tragedies? If so, how do you overcome that?\\n\\nOn assignment, the part of my brain that can feel overwhelmed turns off. It must be adrenaline.\\n\\nOn the ground, I\\'ve spoken to people minutes after they\\'ve seen their friends killed, or hours after their homes have burned down. I\\'ve spent a lot of time with people fighting addiction. Journalists have a responsibility to approach these situations with humility and humanity; that\\'s my priority, so there\\'s little room to dwell on my anxieties.\\n\\nOnce I\\'m home or in my hotel room, that\\'s another thing. Journalists don\\'t talk enough about the effect that stress and adrenaline can have on our bodies, let alone on our mental health. I\\'m lucky to have a partner, family and friends who sustain me emotionally. I also have an informal support group at The Times, journalists with whom I check in regularly and vice versa. But I\\'d like for this to become a bigger conversation in newsrooms.\\n\\nHow do you spend your time when you\\'re off duty?\\n\\nOff duty? El-Oh-El.\\n\\nI\\'m on the road a lot for work and persistently on call for breaking news. It\\'s exhilarating but a double-edged sword. I never imagined I\\'d see so much of this country. But being away from home so often, in many cases with little notice, can be tough.\\n\\n\"Self-care\" has become a hokey phrase, but I do believe in finding healthy ways to relieve stress. Some people I know practice meditation, but that hasn\\'t worked for me. I subscribe to the \"Just Dance\" model of self-care. I try to start my days, at least when I\\'m on the road, with five-minute dance parties. Yes, by myself. Try it! They are extraordinarily rejuvenating. If you\\'re in a bad mood afterward, there\\'s nothing else I can do for you. The trick is making space for some joy and whimsy. That and a steady dose of exercise, novels and \"Grey\\'s Anatomy\" keep me sane.\\n\\nI also try to be mindful of how my work affects my partner. He has been inoculated against my schedule (we started dating while I was covering the Trump campaign). But just because he\\'s exceptionally supportive doesn\\'t mean I\\'m not responsible for him in return. When I\\'m home, we cook together, drink wine and listen to Linda Ronstadt, hike or visit art galleries. The biggest check on my \"screen time\" is my desire to maximize my time with him, friends and family, because I have no idea when I might need to bail. Ten minutes on Twitter are 10 wasted minutes.\\n\\nHow has your background, as a gay man and the son of Mexican immigrants, informed your work?\\n\\nI\\'m always a little bit of an outsider wherever I am. I grew up in a trailer park in Anchorage. My parents don\\'t speak English and hustled hard to get by in the United States. They picked fruit when I was a baby in California. My dad fixed cars and washed dishes at restaurants. My mom cleaned rooms at a hotel for nearly two decades. I worked at that same hotel in high school.\\n\\nBut that feels like a lifetime away now. I went to Harvard on scholarship. I work at The New York Times. My partner is a university professor. Reconciling my life then with my life now can be challenging but enlightening.\\n\\nI feel a responsibility to reflect a range of voices and communities in the articles I write. It\\'s not about a \"Woke Checklist\" -- it\\'s about truth, about reflecting the world as it is and acknowledging our blind spots. That is why I\\'m so passionate about increasing diversity in newsrooms and making entry-level journalism jobs (and internships) financially realistic. I wasn\\'t always so comfortable sharing this stuff about my life, but I want journalists of color and from low-income backgrounds to know this career track is for them, too.\\n\\nIf you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be?\\n\\nIn college, I thought I might want to become an academic. During my sophomore year I fell in love with social theory. Reading Michel Foucault felt like having the veil lifted from my eyes. His ideas about power, systems and \"regimes of truth\" are extremely relevant today.\\n\\nI\\'ve also always had a profound affinity for archives. I sometimes wonder what I\\'d be up to if I were a historian. As a journalist, though, I get to work on the living, daily version of history. It\\'s such a gift.\\n\\nJenna Wortham on the Exhilarating Work That Leaves Her \\'Naked and Shivering\\'March 7, 2019Our Modern Love Editor on How His Job Is \\'a Lot Like Online Dating\\'Feb. 14, 2019Our Tokyo Bureau Chief on Where She Finds \\'Bolts of Insight\\' (Hint: It\\'s Outside the Office)Feb. 1, 2019\\n\\nIllustration by Rebecca Clarke\\n\\nLara Takenaga is a staff editor for the Reader Center.

Gideon is handily beaten through the dark and beautiful necromancy of the bone, which she does not appreciate, and we are delighted by the moral.\\n\\nGideon willed herself to pass out as Crux\\'s cold, bony fingers closed around one of her ankles. It nearly worked. She woke up a few times to blink at the monotonous light that illuminated the lift down to the bottom of the main shaft, and stayed awake when the marshal dragged her like a sack of rotten goods across the bottom of the tier. She felt nothing: not pain, not anger, not disappointment, just a curious sense of wonder and disconnect as she was hauled bodily through the doors of Drearburh. She stirred to life for one last escape attempt, but when he saw her scrabbling at the threadbare carpets on the slick dark floor Crux kicked her in the head. Then she did pass out for a little while, for real, only waking up when she was heaped onto a forward pew. The pew was so cold her skin stuck to it, and each breath was like needles in the lung.\\n\\nShe came to, freezing, to the sound of the prayers. There was no spoken invocation in the Ninth service. There was only the clatter of bones -- knucklebones, all threaded on woven cords, notched and worn -- worked by nuns whose old fingers could pray on them so swiftly that the service became a murmurous rattle. It was a long, narrow hall, and she had been dumped right at the front of it. It was very dark: a rail of gas-discharged light ran all around the aisles, but it always lit like it didn\\'t like the idea and glowed dismally. The arches overhead had been dusted with bioluminescent powders that sometimes trickled down as pale green glitter into the nave, and in all the radiating chapels sat speechless skeletons, still dusty from the farming. Squinting blearily over her shoulder, she saw that most of the sanctum was skeletons. It was a skeleton party. There was room in this deep, long channel of a church for a thousand, and it was half full of skeletons and only very pockmarked with people.\\n\\nThe people mostly sat in the transept, veiled nuns and solitaires, shaven heads and cropped, the weary and scant inhabitants of the Ninth House. Mostly priests of the Locked Tomb, now; there hadn\\'t been soldiers or military friars since she was very young. The only member left of that order was Aiglamene, who\\'d left her leg and any hope of getting the hell out of here on some far-off front line. The clatter in the transept was occasionally interrupted by a wet, racking cough or the haggard clearing of somebody\\'s throat.\\n\\nIn the apse was a long bench, and there sat the last handful of the nobles of the House of the Ninth: Reverend Daughter Harrowhark, sitting modestly to the side, face dusted with a handful of luminescent powder that had stuck to the blood trails coming out her nose; her ghastly great-aunts; and her parents, the Lord and Lady of the House, the Reverend Father and the Reverend Mother. The latter two had pride of place, before the altar, side-on to the congregation. Crux had the honour of sitting on a chair in one of the dank chevets amid a sea of candles, half of them already out. Next to him sat the only house cavalier, Ortus, a wide and sad Ninth youngster of thirty-five, and next to Ortus sat his lady mother, an absolutely standard Ninth crone who kept fussing at his ear with a handkerchief.\\n\\nGideon blinked so that her vision would stop wobbling and focused on the apse. They hadn\\'t managed to cozen her inside Drearburh for a good two years, and she hadn\\'t seen the hideous great-aunts nor the Lord and Lady for a while. Blessed Sister Lachrimorta and Blessed Sister Aisamorta were unaltered. They were still tiny, their faces still tight, grey-painted dribbles, and as the Ninth was free from miracles, they were still blind. They had black bands tied over their faces with white, staring eyes painted on the front. Each preferred to pray two sets of beads, one string in each shrivelled hand, so they sat there clicking a four-part percussion with their suspiciously agile fingers.\\n\\nOrtus hadn\\'t changed either. He was still lumpy and sad. Being the primary cavalier to the House of the Ninth had not for eras been a title of any renown. Cavaliers in other Houses might be revered and noble men and women of long genealogy or particular talent, frequent heroes of Gideon\\'s less prurient magazines, but in the Ninth everyone knew you were chosen for how many bones you could hump around. Ortus was basically a morbid donkey. His father -- cavalier to Harrow\\'s father -- had been an enormous, stony man of some gravity and devotion, with a sword and two huge panniers of fibulae, but Ortus wasn\\'t made in his mould. Coupling him to Harrow had been rather like yoking a doughnut to a cobra. Aiglamene had probably focused her frustrations on Gideon because Ortus was such a drip. He was a sensitive, awful young man, and his mother was obsessed with him; each time he caught a cold he was swaddled and made to lie still until he got bedsores.\\n\\nThe Lord and Lady she looked at too, though she honestly didn\\'t want to. Lady Pelleamena and Lord Priamhark sat side by side, one gloved hand placed on a knee, the other joined to their partner\\'s as they prayed simultaneously on a string of ornate bones. Black cloth swathed them toe to neck, and their faces were mostly obscured by dark hoods: Gideon could see their pale, waxy profiles, streaked with luminescent powder, the mark of Harrow\\'s handprint still visible on both. Their eyes were closed. Pelleamena\\'s face was still frozen and fine as it had been the last time Gideon had seen her, the dark wings of her brows unsilvered, the thin fretwork of lines next to each eye uncrowded by new. Priam\\'s jaw was still firm, his shoulder unstooped, his brow clear and unlined. They were utterly unchanged; less changed, even, than the shitty great-aunts. This was because they\\'d both been dead for years.\\n\\nTheir mummified faces did not yield to time because -- as Gideon knew, and the marshal, and the captain of the guard, and nobody else in the universe -- Harrowhark had frozen them forever. Ever the obsessive and secretive scholar, she had derived at great cost some forgotten way of preserving and puppeting the bodies. She had found a nasty, forbidden little book in the great Ninth repositories of nasty, forbidden little books, and all the Houses would have had a collective aneurysm if they knew she\\'d even read it. She hadn\\'t executed it very well -- her parents were fine from the shoulders up, but from the shoulders down they were bad -- though she had, admittedly, been ten.\\n\\nGideon had been eleven when the Lord and Lady of the House of the Ninth had slipped into death in sudden, awful secret. It was such a huge bag of ass how it had happened: what she\\'d found, what she\\'d seen. She hadn\\'t been sad. If she\\'d been stuck being Harrow\\'s parents she would have done the same years ago.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said the Reverend Daughter of the Ninth, rising to stand.\\n\\nThe enthroned Lord and Lady should have taken charge of the sacred ritual, but they couldn\\'t, because they were mega-dead. Harrowhark had handily gotten around this by giving them a vow of silence. Every year she added to their penitents\\' vows -- of fasting, of daily contemplation, of seclusion -- so blandly and barefacedly that it seemed inevitable that someone would eventually say hang on a minute, this sounds like... A LOAD OF HOT GARBAGE, and she\\'d be found out. But she never was. Crux covered for her, and so did Aiglamene, and the Lord\\'s cavalier had helpfully decided to die the day that Priam died. And so Gideon covered too, hating every moment, saving up this last secret in the hopes that with it she could extort her freedom.\\n\\nAll prayer beads stopped clacking. The hands of Harrow\\'s parents stilled unnaturally in unison. Gideon slung her arms around the back of her pew and kicked one foot up atop the other, wishing her head would stop ringing.\\n\\n\"The noble House of the Ninth has called you here today,\" said Harrowhark, \"because we have been given a gift of enormous import. Our sacred Emperor -- the Necrolord Prime, the King of the Nine Renewals, our Resurrector -- has sent us summons.\"\\n\\nThat got asses in seats. The skeletons remained perfectly still and attentive, but a querulous excitement arose from the assorted Ninth congregation. There were soft cries of joy. There were exclamations of praise and thankfulness. The letter could have been a drawing of a butt and they would have been lining up thrice to kiss the edge of the paper.\\n\\n\"I will share this letter with you,\" said Harrowhark, \"because nobody loves their people, their sacred brothers and sacred sisters, as the Ninth House loves her people -- her devotees and her priests, her children and her faithful.\" (Gideon thought Harrow was slathering it on pretty thick.) \"If the Reverend Mother will permit her daughter to read?\"\\n\\nLike she\\'d say no with Harrow\\'s hands on her strings. With a pallid smile, Pelleamena gently inclined her head in a way she never had in life: alive, she had been as chill and remote as ice at the bottom of a cave. \"With my gracious mother\\'s permission,\" said Harrow, and began to read:\\n\\n\"ADDRESSING THE HOUSE OF THE NINTH, ITS REVEREND LADY PELLEAMENA HIGHT NOVENARIUS AND ITS REVEREND LORD PRIAM HIGHT NONIUSVIANUS:\\n\\n\"Salutations to the House of the Ninth, and blessings upon its tombs, its peaceful dead, and its manifold mysteries.\\n\\n\"His Celestial Kindliness, the First Reborn, begs this house to honour its love for the Creator, as set in the contract of tenderness made on the day of the Resurrection, and humbly asks for the first fruits of your household...\\n\\n(\"My name is listed here,\" said Harrowhark, simpering modestly, then with less enthusiasm: \" -- and Ortus\\'s.\")\\n\\n\"For in need now are the Emperor\\'s Hands, the most blessed and beloved of the King Undying, the faithful and the everlasting! The Emperor calls now for postulants to the position of Lyctor, heirs to the eight stalwarts who have served these ten thousand years: as many of them now lie waiting for the rivers to rise on the day they wake to their King, those lonely Guard remaining petition for their numbers to be renewed and their Lord above Lords to find eight new liegemen.\\n\\n\"To this end we beg the first of your House and their cavalier to kneel in glory and attend the finest study, that of being the Emperor\\'s bones and joints, his fists and gestures...\\n\\n\"Eight we hope will meditate and ascend to the Emperor in glory in the temple of the First House, eight new Lyctors joined with their cavaliers; and if the Necrolord Highest blesses but does not take, they shall return home in full honour, with trump and timbrel.\\n\\n\"There is no dutiful gift so perfect, nor so lovely in his eyes.\"\\n\\nHarrowhark lowered the paper to a long silence; a real silence, without even the hint of a prayer knuckle clacking or a skeleton\\'s jaw falling off. The Ninth seemed completely taken aback. There was a wheezing squeal from one of the pews in the transept behind Gideon as one of the faithful decided to go the whole hog and have a heart attack, and this distracted everyone. The nuns tried their best, but a few minutes later it was confirmed that one of the hermits had died of shock, and everyone around him celebrated his sacred good fortune. Gideon failed to hide a snicker as Harrowhark sighed, obviously calculating inside her head what this did to the current Ninth census.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t!\"\\n\\nA second hand disturbed the community tomb as Ortus\\'s mother stood, finger trembling, her other arm draped around her son\\'s shoulders. He looked completely affrighted. She looked as though she were about to follow the faithful departed to an untimely grave, face frozen beneath her alabaster base paint, black skull paint slipping with sweat.\\n\\n\"My son -- my son,\" she cried out, shrill and cracked; \"my firstborn sweet! His father\\'s endowment! My only joy!\"\\n\\n\"Sister Glaurica, please,\" said Harrow, looking bored.\\n\\nOrtus\\'s mother had wrapped both arms around him now, and was weeping fully into his shoulder. Her own shook with very real fear and grief. He looked wetly depressed. She was saying, between sobs: \"I gave you my husband -- Lord Noniusvianus, I gave you my spouse -- Lord Noniusvianus, do you demand my son of me? Do you demand my son? Surely not! Surely not now!\"\\n\\n\"You forget yourself, Glaurica,\" Crux snapped.\\n\\n\"I know the things that befall cavaliers, my lord, I know his fate!\"\\n\\n\"Sister Glaurica,\" Harrowhark said, \"be calm.\"\\n\\n\"He is young,\" quavered Ortus\\'s mother, half-pulling him into the safety of the chevet when she realised Lord Noniusvianus would not intercede. \"He is young, he is not robust.\"\\n\\n\"Some would say otherwise,\" said Harrowhark, sotto voce.\\n\\nBut Ortus said, with his big, sombre eyes and his squashed, disheartened voice: \"I do fear death, my Lady Harrowhark.\"\\n\\n\"A cavalier should welcome death,\" said Aiglamene, affronted.\\n\\n\"Your father welcomed death unflinching,\" said Crux.\\n\\nAt this tender piece of sympathy, his mother burst into tears. The congregation muttered, mostly reproachful, and Gideon started to perk up. It wasn\\'t quite the worst day of her life now. This was some A-grade entertainment. Ortus, not bothering to disentangle himself from his sobbing parent, was mumbling that he would make sure she was provided for; the heinous great-aunts had returned to prayer and were crooning a wordless hymn; Crux was loudly abusing Ortus\\'s mother; and Harrowhark stood in this sea, mute and contemptuous as a monument.\\n\\n\" -- leave and pray for guidance, or I\\'ll have you, I\\'ll take you off the sanctuary,\" Crux was saying.\\n\\n\" -- I gave this house everything; I paid the highest price -- \"\\n\\n\" -- what comes of Mortus marrying an immigrant Eighth, you shameful hag -- \"\\n\\nGideon was grinning so hugely that her split lips recommenced bleeding. Amid the massed heads of the uncaring dead and the disturbed devout, Harrowhark\\'s eyes found hers, and that disdainful mask slipped in its blankness; her lips thinned. The people clamoured. Gideon winked.\\n\\n\"Enough,\" snapped the Reverend Daughter, voice like a knife\\'s edge. \"Let us pray.\"\\n\\nSilence sank over the congregation, like the slowly falling flakes of luminescent dust. The sobbing of Ortus\\'s mother hushed into silent, shuddering tears, buried in her son\\'s chest as he put his doughy arm around her. He was crying soundlessly into her hair. The hymn of the nasty great-aunts ended on a high and tremulous note, never relieved, wasting away in midair; Harrow bowed her head and her parents did too, simultaneous in obedience. The great-aunts nodded their heads to their chests; Aiglamene and Crux followed suit. Gideon stared up at the ceiling and re-crossed her ankles over each other, blinked bits of luminescent grit from her eyes.\\n\\n\"I pray the tomb is shut forever,\" recited Harrowhark, with the curious fervidity she always showed in prayer. \"I pray the rock is never rolled away. I pray that which was buried remains buried, insensate, in perpetual rest with closed eye and stilled brain. I pray it lives, I pray it sleeps... I pray for the needs of the Emperor All-Giving, the Undying King, his Virtues and his men. I pray for the Second House, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth; the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth. I pray for the Ninth House, and I pray for it to be fruitful. I pray for the soldiers and adepts far from home, and all those parts of the Empire that live in unrest and disquiet. Let it be so.\"\\n\\nThey all prayed to let it be so, with much rattling of bones. Gideon had not prayed for a very long time. She looked over the bald, gleaming skulls of the assembled skeletons and the short-haired heads of the faithful Ninth, and wondered what she\\'d do first when she left for Trentham. The sobs of Ortus\\'s unfortunate mother interrupted the clatter and her less-than-realistic thoughts of doing chin-ups in front of a dozen clapping ensigns, and she saw Harrow whispering to Crux, gesturing at mother and son, her face a painting of bloodless patience. Crux led them off the sanctuary none too gently. They passed down the centre of the nave, Crux hustling, Ortus lumbering, Ortus\\'s mother barely able to stand in her misery. Gideon gave the unfortunate cavalier a thumbs-up as they passed: Ortus returned a brief and watery smile.\\n\\nMuster broke up after that. Most of the congregation stayed to keep praying at their good fortune, knowing that the Secundarius Bell would be ringing in a scant hour anyway. Gideon would have vaulted up to leave and sprint back to her shuttle first thing, but the skeletons flooded out in neat, serried ranks down the centre of the nave, two abreast, blocking all other progress in their readiness to get back to their snow leeks and the heat lamps of their fields. The disgusting great-aunts removed themselves behind the parcloses to the claustrophobic family chapel off to one side, and Harrowhark ordered her parents\\' complaisant mummies out of sight to wherever she usually hid them. Back in their lavish household cell, probably, and to bar the door after. Gideon was massaging sprains from her fingers as her sword-master came seesawing down the aisle.\\n\\n\"She lies,\" said Gideon absently, by way of greeting. \"If you hadn\\'t noticed. She never keeps her promises. Not a one.\"\\n\\nAiglamene did not answer. Gideon didn\\'t expect her to. She just stood there, not yet meeting her student\\'s gaze, one liver-spotted hand clutched tight to the grip of her sword. Eventually, she said gruffly: \"You have always suffered from a want of duty, Nav. You can\\'t argue that. You couldn\\'t spell obligation if I shoved the letters up your ass.\"\\n\\n\"I gotta say, I don\\'t think that would help,\" said Gideon. \"God, I\\'m glad you didn\\'t teach me my spelling.\"\\n\\n\"A soldier\\'s best quality is her sense of allegiance. Of loyalty. Nothing else survives.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Gideon, and, experimenting, rose from the pew. She was standing fine, but her ribs ached; one was probably cracked. Her butt hurt from being dragged. She was going to be swollen with bruises before nightfall, and she needed to have a tooth put back in -- not by one of the nuns, though, never again. The Cohort would have bone magicians aplenty. \"I know. It\\'s fine. Don\\'t get me wrong, Captain. Where I\\'m going, I promise to piss fidelity all the livelong day. I have lots of fealty in me. I fealt the Emperor with every bone in my body. I fealt hard.\"\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t know fealty if it -- \"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t hypothetically shove stuff up my butt again,\" said Gideon, \"it never does any good.\"\\n\\nThe lopsided old woman took a scabbard off her back and wearily handed it over. It was Gideon\\'s. Her sword had been sheathed safely inside it. Aiglamene tossed her the abandoned suitcase, to boot. This would be the closest to an apology she would get. The woman would never touch her, and she would never give her a word that had no edges. But this was nearly tender for the captain of the guard, and Gideon would take it and run.\\n\\nDetermined footsteps sounded down the centre aisle, alongside the sound of ancient lace rustling over slick obsidian. Gideon\\'s gut tightened, but she said: \"How the hell are you going to get out of this one, Nonagesimus?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not,\" said Harrow, surprising her. The Reverend Daughter\\'s sharp-angled, foxy chin was thrust out, and she still had a thick rime of blood circling each nostril, but with her burning black eyes she looked exalted as a bad bone saint. \"I\\'m going. This is my chance for intercession. You couldn\\'t comprehend.\"\\n\\nGideon wanted to punch her lights out, but she said instead, with forced jollity: \"By the way, I worked out your nasty little trick, jackass.\"\\n\\nAiglamene did not cuff her for this, which was also some sort of apology; she just jabbed a warning finger in her direction. Harrow cocked her chin up in genuine surprise, hood falling away from her dark, short-cropped head. \"Did you?\" she drawled. \"Really?\"\\n\\n\"Your mother\\'s signature on the commission. The sting in the tail. If I come clean,\" she said, \"that renders the signature null and void, doesn\\'t it? It buys my silence. Well played. I\\'ll have to keep my mouth shut when I hand that one over, and you know it.\"\\n\\nHarrowhark cocked her head the other way, lightly.\\n\\n\"I hadn\\'t even thought of that,\" she said. \"I thought you meant the shuttle.\"\\n\\nAlarm bells rang in Gideon\\'s head, like the First and Second Peal all mixed together. She could feel the heat drain from her face, and she was already backing out of the pew, into the aisle, wheeling away. Harrowhark\\'s face was a painted study of innocence, of perfect unconcern. At the expression on Gideon\\'s, Aiglamene had put a hand on her sword, moving herself between the two with a warning stump of the leg.\\n\\nGideon said, with difficulty: \"What -- about -- the shuttle?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Ortus and his mother stole it,\" said Harrowhark. \"They must be gone already. She still has family back on the Eighth, and she thinks they\\'ll take them in.\" At her expression, Harrow laughed: \"You make it so easy, Griddle. You always do.\"\\n\\nGideon had never confronted a broken heart before. She had never gotten far enough to have her heart broken. She knelt on the landing field, knees in the grit, arms clutched around herself. There was nothing left but blown-out, curly patterns in the pebbles where the shuttle had passed. A great dullness had sunk over her; a deep coldness, a thick stolidity. When her heart beat in her chest it was with a huge, steady grief. Every pulse seemed to be the space between insensibility and knives. For some moments she was awake, and she was filled with a slow-burning mine fire, the kind that never went out and crumbled everything from the inside; for all the other moments, it was as though she had gone somewhere else.\\n\\nBehind her stood the Lady of the Ninth House, watching her with no satisfaction.\\n\\n\"I got wind of your plan only last week,\" she admitted.\\n\\nGideon said nothing.\\n\\n\"A week before,\" Harrow continued. \"I wouldn\\'t have known at all, if I hadn\\'t gotten the summons. You\\'d done everything right. They said I could put my reply on the shuttle I had previously scheduled, if I wanted to write in paper. I will give you your due: there was no way you could have accounted for that. I could have spoiled it before, but I wanted to wait until now to do anything. I wanted to wait... for the very moment when you thought you\\'d gotten away... to take it from you.\"\\n\\nGideon could only manage, \"Why?\"\\n\\nThe girl\\'s expression was the same as it was on the day that Gideon had found her parents, dangling from the roof of their cell. It was blank and white and still.\\n\\n\"Because I completely fucking hate you,\" said Harrowhark, \"no offence.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'tor.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Tor.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'tamsyn_muir@tor.com', 'name': 'Tamsyn Muir', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gideon_header2.jpg?fit=1000%2C+9999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C650px&ssl=1&w=640', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'wgt': 8}\n",

He Told Investigators It Was 'Awesome'\", 'body': 'Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan testifies during a House Armed Services Committee hearing, March 26, 2019 in Washington, DC. Shanahan was cleared by the Pentagon of violating ethics standards and favoring his former employer Boeing. Drew Angerer -- Getty Images\\n\\nThe Pentagon\\'s watchdog cleared acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan in its investigation into whether he violated any ethics rules by promoting his longtime former employer Boeing while serving in the Trump Administration. The reprieve removes a major hurdle for President Donald Trump to nominate him as Defense Secretary, a post that has been empty for 112 days since James Mattis resigned last December.\\n\\nThe Department of Defense Office of Inspector General had launched the probe in the face of allegations he pushed military leadership to purchase more Boeing-made F-15X fighter jets and openly criticized Boeing-rival Lockheed Martin Corp. during government meetings. The allegations were based on referrals from an anonymous Senate Armed Services Committee attorney, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\'s staff, several media reports and a outside watchdog group, called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\\n\\nThe inspector general was able clear Shanahan in a just a month, which is lightning-quick for an Inspector General\\'s investigation that often run months-long. Over that time, investigators said they interviewed Shanahan and 33 witnesses, including top Pentagon brass, while also poring over more than 7,300 pages of classified and unclassified documents.\\n\\n\"We found that the allegations were not substantiated and that Mr. Shanahan fully complied with his ethics agreements and ethical obligations regarding Boeing and its competitors,\" the inspector general said in its 47-page report, which was made public Thursday.\\n\\nShanahan, who came to the Pentagon after spending more than three decades at Boeing, has routinely fended off questions about potential conflicts of interest with the aerospace company, which also happens to be one of the largest suppliers for the U.S. military. In March, he told Congress that he welcomed any such investigation into his actions in office.\\n\\nThe investigation came after Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington wrote a nine-page complaint in March to the Pentagon\\'s inspector general urging the agency to scrutinize the relationship. In its complaint, the group cited a Politico report from January that said Shanahan had been promoting Boeing while criticizing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a Lockheed Martin program. The plane was \"f-cked up,\" he reportedly said, and Lockheed Martin \"doesn\\'t know how to run a program.\"\\n\\nHowever, the inspector general said in its report that Shanahan told investigators that he never said the F-35 fighter jet, itself, was \"f-cked up.\" He told them the aircraft is \"awesome.\" However, Shanahan told investigators that he said the F -35 program was \"f-cked up.\" Evidently, that point of distinction was important, because the inspector general found his comments were \"substantive, related to the program\\'s performance, and were consistent with comments about the F -35 program made by other senior Government officials.\"\\n\\nThe inspector general\\'s office interviewed those most likely to have encountered Shanahan\\'s alleged bias, including Shanahan\\'s old boss, Mattis; Gen. David Goldfein, the chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force; Marine Commandant Gen. Robert Neller. Investigators also reviewed Shanahan\\'s emails and other correspondence for terms related to Boeing and Boeing products.\\n\\n\"We determined that Mr. Shanahan did not make the alleged comments and did not promote Boeing, or disparage its competitors,\" the inspector general\\'s report said. \"While Mr. Shanahan did routinely refer to his prior industry experience in meetings, witnesses interpreted it, and told us, that he was doing it to describe his experience and to improve Government management of DoD programs, rather than to promote Boeing or its products.\"\\n\\nThe inspector general also cleared Shanahan of any wrongdoing in three other issues related to Boeing, which were also proven erroneous.\\n\\n\"I have never heard him mention, nor have I had a conversation [with him] about Boeing, and to the extent that the issue has come up we did Congressional testimony together,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford told investigators.\\n\\nLieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, did not comment on the findings. \"Acting Secretary Shanahan\\'s focus remains on our global operations, our strategy, and our service members, civilians, and families,\" he said in a statement.\\n\\nThe resolution of the allegations takes on increased importance because Shanahan, 56, is the leading contender to become Defense Secretary. He has the dubious distinction of being the longest serving \"Acting Defense Secretary\" in the nation\\'s history. The path is now clear for the nomination, now that this dark cloud has passed.\\n\\nA Washington state native, Shanahan initially stepped into the No. 2 spot at the Pentagon in 2017 after leaving his business career at Boeing. A mechanical engineer by trade, with two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shanahan quietly turned around some of Boeing\\'s most troubled programs, including a multibillion-dollar missile defense system and the problem-plagued 787 commercial airliner. His success earned him the nickname, \"Mr. Fix-It,\" inside the company.\\n\\nAt the Pentagon, Shanahan has assumed the role of a technocrat, leading efforts to cut wasteful spending and create a standalone Space Force - a priority for President Donald Trump. He\\'s maintained a low public profile thus far, and he has not forged strong ties around Washington like Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, had garnered.\\n\\nShanahan, who has relatively little foreign policy experience, would assume the top job at a time of historic change around the world. He\\'ll have to juggle the continued fight against terror groups in the Middle East, Russia\\'s renewed resurgence in Europe and China\\'s muscular rise in Asia. Add to that the litany of other issues putting pressure on the liberal international order that won the Cold War and advanced American interests for a half century.\\n\\nShanahan now has a daunting task of navigating this minefield, while also managing the expectations of a demanding Commander-in-Chief. For instance, the Pentagon entanglements in the Administration\\'s immigration policy have worried both parties on Capitol Hill, and top U.S. military leaders have faced tough questions from Congress about the months-long troop presence along the southern border with Mexico. The Pentagon is also on the hook to help shelter 5,000 migrant children caught crossing the U.S. southern border without a parent.\\n\\n\"It shouldn\\'t come as a surprise that we\\'ll provide more support to the border,\" Shanahan told reporters on April 12. \"And the way I tend to frame that is, it\\'s -- our support is very elastic.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'time.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TIME'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'w_j_hennigan@time.com', 'name': 'W.J.

Most of the focus was on how investors submitted orders for about $60 billion of bonds. Even if you are (rightly) skeptical of \"order books\" and think the true demand was for half that amount, it\\'s still a remarkable development for a country that just a few months ago was being ostracized for its role in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. But there\\'s more to the story.\\n\\nIn essence, the high demand is a referendum on the oil market. Investors are really looking to jump into the deal because they think that oil prices, which are up more than 50 percent from the lows in December, are headed much higher. Rising oil prices are generally not a problem for markets during times of economic strength, but the majority of analysts expect weaker growth, with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development having just slashed its global forecast for this year to 3.3 percent from a previous estimate of 3.5 percent. Higher crude prices could act as a further drag on the economy and weigh on riskier financial assets. In the U.S., for example, prices for a gallon of regular grade gasoline have risen to an average of $2.74 heading into the all-important summer driving season, according to the Automobile Association of America, up from January\\'s low of $2.23 a gallon. Prices are in sight of the $2.90 a gallon seen in early October right before personal spending took a dive and equity markets collapsed. Some might say that higher oil prices indicate an economy that isn\\'t as bad as thought, but the reality is they probably have more to do with a decline in the supplies, thanks to OPEC.\\n\\nOPEC and its partners, which pump about half of the world\\'s oil, have been successful in cutting in production to get oil back to near the levels they need to cover government spending, according to Bloomberg News\\'s Grant Smith. On top of that, there\\'s now concern that an escalating conflict in Libya, whose oil is prized for its quality, could cause crude supplies to tighten further. \"The expectation that the tightened supply picture is going to boost prices is starting\" to gain traction, said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst at Tradition Energy, according to Bloomberg News.\\n\\nBOND BULLS FACE CRITICAL WEEK\\n\\nPerhaps it was the potential negative effect of rising oil prices on the global economy that prompted bond investors to step up at the U.S. Treasury Department\\'s auction of super-safe bills on Monday. The offering of $42 billion of three-month bills attracted bids for 3.07 times the amount offered, the most since January. The offering of $36 billion in six-month bills generated a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.14, the highest since February. Relatively high-yielding cash equivalents such as Treasury bills should see demand in an uncertain economic environment like the one the U.S. currently faces. Plus, the market is pricing in about a 100 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points this year. Regardless, this is a big week for the world\\'s most important market. Besides the regular bill auctions, the Treasury Department will offer $78 billion in three-, 10- and 30-year notes and bonds. In addition, the government on Wednesday will release the monthly Consumer Price Index report for March -- which is forecast to show faster inflation, in part because of rising oil and gas prices -- and the Fed will release the minutes of its March monetary policy meeting the same day. \"For the market to begin pricing in a hike, we will need to see persistent inflation pressures,\" said Noelle Corum, a portfolio manager in the fixed-income group at Invesco Advisers Inc., according to Bloomberg News.\\n\\nA PRUDENT STOCK BEAR\\'S WARNING\\n\\nIn the second and third quarters of last year, when U.S. stocks were flying higher, Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson wasn\\'t impressed. Wilson stuck to his call that the S&P 500 Index would end that year at 2,750 even as the benchmark jumped above 2,900 and the median estimate among 25 Wall Street strategists surveyed by Bloomberg rose to 3,000. Everyone knows what happened next, as the S&P 500 began a long tumble that pushed it down to around 2,500 at the end of last year. In short, Wilson was right to be skeptical, and his views haven\\'t really changed even though the S&P 500 rebounded to 2,891 on Monday. His year-end forecast is still 2,750, and his reasoning is sound. As Wilson puts it, the recent gains were mainly due to the notion that bad economic news would be good for riskier assets by forcing the Fed to put its rate-hike plans on hold. But that trade is played out. \"Unlike in January, I doubt bad fundamental news will be good for stocks any more, given significantly higher valuations today and the fact that the Fed can\\'t pivot any further at this point without signaling rate cuts,\" Wilson wrote in a Sunday research note. \"Historically, the first rate cut is a red flag for stocks because it portends even weaker growth, rather than the positive inflection point that comes from a pause.\" Wilson adds that the Fed \"has fixed\" the tight financial conditions that sparked the sell-off. \"However, it can\\'t roll back the corporate cost pressures created by the fiscal stimulus\" and \"these pressures now have to play out in what we\\'ve been calling for since last fall -- a profits recession.\"\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT WHO CRIED WOLF\\n\\nTime was when President Donald Trump could rattle the peso with a tweet or an off-the-cuff remark criticizing Mexico over trade or its handling of immigrants passing through that country on their way to the U.S.\\'s southern border. No more. The peso gained on Monday despite broader weakness in emerging-market currencies and threats by Trump over the weekend to close the border with its southern neighbor \"and/or\" tariffs. The peso appreciated as much as 0.84 percent on Monday, strengthening below 19 a dollar in its fourth intraday gain and becoming the biggest driver of the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index\\'s decline. The moves suggest that traders are starting to ignore Trump\\'s repeated threats against Mexico, having seemingly made contradictory remarks about potential tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican-made cars and a border closing. As Bloomberg News\\'s Sebastian Boyd points out, a lot of U.S. car companies such as Ford, Chysler and General Motors use factories in Mexico, and any tariffs like the one Trump has threatened could harm the U.S. economy. Plus, Mexican auto-parts suppliers such as Metalsa, which makes the chassis for the Chevy Colorado, Chrysler Ram and Ford F-150 pickup trucks, also have plants in the U.S. Tariff-induced pain could also cause them to cut back there, hurting jobs. Mexico\\'s stock market is also starting to hum, with the benchmark Bolsa IPC rising on Monday to its highest level since November.\\n\\nISRAELI INVESTORS ARE BECALMED\\n\\nGiven Israel\\'s strategic Middle East location and geopolitical influence, elections there are always an important event. The stakes are higher than usual in this week\\'s elections, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing the possibility of being indicted for fraud and bribery and, as Bloomberg Opinion contributor Pankaj Mishra puts it, Israel\\'s traditional support base in the U.S. showing signs of weakness as a more outspoken left seeks to reshape foreign policy. And yet, investors appear unfazed. The shekel has steadily appreciated this year, gaining 4.30 percent in one of the world\\'s best performances against the dollar. The benchmark Tel Aviv Stock Exchange 35 Index has gained more than 7 percent this year. All this even though the Bank of Israel\\'s research department on Monday cut its growth forecast for this year to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent, predicting exports would underperform amid sluggish global trade. Even so, that\\'s not so bad and the central bank is in an accommodating mood, deciding to keep interest rates at an ultralow 0.25 percent. \"We think that the window for rate hikes in Israel is rapidly closing,\" Guy Beit-Or, head of macro research at Psagot Investment House Ltd., wrote in a research note. \"In the likely event of rate cuts in the U.S. and around the world in 2020, we don\\'t see a scenario in which the BOI will hike.\"\\n\\nTEA LEAVES\\n\\nThe National Federation of Independent Business\\'s monthly index of sentiment among U.S. small-business owners had fallen for five straight months through January before showing a small gain for February. So, was that increase the start of a new upswing or a just a pause on the way to a deeper slide? Markets will get some answers Tuesday when the next report is due. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for another small rise, to 102 from 101.7 in February. But that would still keep the gauge a long way from the 35-year high of 108.8 in August. \"Companies in this segment have recently become cautious about taking on new workers, a trend also reflected in the recent ADP private-hiring data by company size,\" Bloomberg Economics noted in a research note Monday. \"Such vigilance could have been related to uncertainty surrounding small business owners\\' expectations for 2018 tax refunds, and will likely be temporary.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'robert_burgess@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'Robert Burgess', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/itN7CSpxZDSs/v1/1200x800.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.1529411764705882, 'wgt': 8}\n",

Mr. Trump has also used the threat of tariffs against Canada, Europe, Japan and Mexico to help speed up negotiations and win concessions from trading partners.\\n\\nBut it caught Chinese officials off guard. \"On Monday morning in Beijing, they were trying to decide whether Vice Premier Liu He should go ahead with his visit\" to Washington later this week for a round of negotiations, Ms. Swanson writes. Mr. Liu\\'s plans were unclear at the time of writing.\\n\\nNew tariffs could hurt China if they lead to long-term trade tensions. Tao Wang, an economist specializing in China at UBS, told the NYT that a full-blown trade war with the U.S. could cut China\\'s economic growth rate 1.6 to 2 percentage points over the next 12 months.\\n\\nBut while the U.S. \"believes it has leverage over China, huge swaths of the American economy depend on access to the Chinese market for materials, products and sales,\" Ms. Swanson adds. \"It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump\\'s threat will produce a beneficial trade agreement for the United States -- or whether his attempts to pressure China will backfire by pushing already-tense relations past the breaking point.\"\\n\\nThe markets didn\\'t like the news. Stocks in Asia and Europe tumbled, and futures suggest that major U.S. indexes will open lower today.\\n\\nWarren Buffett still loves capitalism\\n\\nWith many billionaires apologizing for what capitalism has wrought, at least one man isn\\'t distancing himself from his love of the free-market economy, Andrew writes in his latest column.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a card-carrying capitalist,\" Mr. Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway\\'s annual meeting over the weekend. \"I believe we wouldn\\'t be sitting here except for the market system,\" he added. \"I don\\'t think the country will go into socialism in 2020 or 2040 or 2060.\"\\n\\n\"There is something oddly refreshing about Mr. Buffett\\'s frankness,\" Andrew writes. \"Many of today\\'s business leaders appear to publicly wring their hands over the state of inequality or take moral stands on public policy issues. But when it comes to offering up concrete solutions and actually making the hard decisions that could affect their bottom lines, they have much less to say.\"\\n\\n\"He believes that the pursuit of capitalism is fundamentally moral -- that it creates and produces prosperity and progress even when there are immoral actors and even when it creates inequality.\"\\n\\nMr. Buffett also dismissed the E.S.G. movement, in which investors and policymakers attempt to fix capitalism by focusing on environmental, social and governance initiatives. \"We are not going to tie up resources doing things just because it is the standard procedure in corporate America,\" he said.\\n\\nMore: ICYMI, here\\'s a cheat sheet to the highlights from Berkshire\\'s annual meeting.\\n\\nOccidental raises its cash offer for Anadarko\\n\\nOccidental juiced its acquisition bid last night by increasing the cash component of its offer in an effort to outdo Chevron, Clifford Krauss of the NYT reports.\\n\\nIts offer is now 78 percent cash, up from 50 percent. Its total cash-and-stock proposal remains unchanged, at $76 per share, or $38 billion. Chevron has offered $33 billion.\\n\\nSome of the cash comes from Occidental\\'s sell-off of investments across Africa to Total, the French energy giant. Under a binding agreement, Occidental would receive $8.8 billion from Total for assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa after a successful acquisition of Anadarko. (Berkshire Hathaway previously committed $10 billion.)\\n\\nThe move could help \"win the support of Anadarko\\'s shareholders who may well make the final decision,\" Mr. Krauss writes.\\n\\nBut it\\'s not a done deal. \"Chevron is expected by some Wall Street analysts to sweeten its offer to counteract Occidental\\'s recent moves,\" Mr. Krauss adds.\\n\\nA mix-up on standard Boeing safety features\\n\\nConfusion inside Boeing about a feature implicated in two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max jets has underlined the flawed design and rollout of the airplane, David Gelles and Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT report.\\n\\n* \"When Boeing began delivering its 737 Max to customers in 2017, the company believed that a key cockpit warning light was a standard feature in all of the new jets.\"\\n\\n* \"But months after the planes were flying, company engineers realized that the warning light worked only on planes whose customers had bought a different, optional indicator.\"\\n\\n* \"In essence, that meant a safety feature that Boeing thought was standard was actually a premium add-on.\"\\n\\n* \"Because only 20 percent of customers had purchased the optional indicator, the warning light was not working on most of Boeing\\'s new jets.\"\\n\\n* \"Boeing said it did not inform airlines or the Federal Aviation Administration about the mistake for a year.\"\\n\\n\"The revelations add to Boeing\\'s mounting problems, which include frayed relations with airlines and customers, multiple federal investigations, growing financial costs and the remaining work to get the Max flying again,\" Mr. Gelles and Ms. Kitroeff write. \"The initial lack of knowledge about the feature\\'s functionality, along with the delayed disclosure, add to the concern about Boeing\\'s management of the Max\\'s design.\"\\n\\nF.T.C. can\\'t decide how to punish Facebook\\n\\nHolding Facebook accountable for its mishandling of users\\' personal data appears to be a no-brainer for the Federal Trade Commission. But deciding what that penalty should be is proving difficult, Cecilia Kang of the NYT writes.\\n\\n* \"The F.T.C.\\'s five commissioners agreed months ago that they wanted to pursue a historic penalty that would show the agency\\'s teeth.\"\\n\\n* \"But now, the members are split on the size and scope of the tech company\\'s punishment,\" according to unidentified sources.\\n\\n* One of the most contentious issues \"has been the degree to which Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\\'s chief executive, should be held personally liable.\"\\n\\n* Differences among the commissioners are \"complicating the final days of the talks.\"\\n\\n\"The stakes are enormous\" for both the agency and Joseph J. Simons, its Republican chairman, Ms. Kang writes. \"The case is being closely watched globally as a litmus test on how the United States government will police the country\\'s tech giants.\"\\n\\nDon\\'t expect new limits on Facebook\\'s data practices, like tracking of users and sharing data with its partners. \"Mr. Simons has argued that the settlement proposal sets a new bar for enforcement of privacy violations and wants to avoid litigation that risks losing that opportunity,\" Ms. Kang writes.\\n\\nCBS News is braced for a shake-up\\n\\nSusan Zirinsky, the new president of CBS News, is about to put her stamp on the network by changing the anchor lineup, John Koblin and Michael M.

House prices are predicted to fall 20 percent in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank Ltd., and rents are now growing at the slowest pace in records dating back to the early 1970s:\\n\\nThe share of Australians saying that housing affordability is one of their top three issues has also fallen to its lowest level since before the last election in 2016, according to Essential Report polling:\\n\\nEven for those on low incomes, things appear to be turning. While Sydney is still an alarmingly expensive city, the number of properties advertised for rent at 30 percent or less of a typical minimum-wage income has doubled in less than two years to more than a fifth of total advertisements, according to a report this week by Anglicare Australia:\\n\\nOne response might be to assume it's because the great foreign invasion has finally been beaten back. In truth, it's close to the opposite: The wave that broke across the country in recent years has bailed Australian governments and regulators out of their own policy mistakes.\\n\\nForeign -- particularly Chinese -- spending on Australian real estate has certainly been significant. Chinese investment rose more than 10-fold between 2010 and 2016 to hit A$32 billion ($23 billion), enough on its own to represent nearly 15 percent of total reportable external investment in the country, according to data from the Foreign Investment Review Board or FIRB, a government regulator. In recent years, about a quarter of all overseas real estate investment has come from mainland China. 1 That rises to a third or more if you include Hong Kong and Singapore -- popular conduits for mainland investors.\\n\\nYet that spending has had little effect on the existing housing stock because of restrictions on overseas investment. Foreigners are normally allowed to buy established homes in Australia only if they have a residency visa; they must sell when that paperwork expires. Such purchases rarely account for more than a percentage point or so of the almost 500,000 home sales taking place each year.\\n\\nWhere overseas money does make a difference is in new housing, for which the rules are much more open. In the five years through June 2018, the FIRB granted 97,000 approvals for foreigners to buy undeveloped residential properties, with a total value of around A$179 billion.\\n\\nThat's helped the country in two ways. First, home sales sit alongside tourism, education and the export of iron ore, coal, natural gas and gold as one of Australia's biggest sources of foreign capital. Perhaps more importantly, though, those inflows have led to a boom in home-building that's one of the main reasons the country's housing bubble is now gently deflating.\\n\\nAs we've written, the construction splurge between 2015 and 2017 was a unique period in recent Australian history when housing starts ran consistently ahead of household formation. That was driven heavily by two reviled categories of investors, foreigners and baby boomers, who encouraged a wave of apartment-building that's changed the skyline of the country's cities.\\n\\nAbout 1.03 million homes were started in the five years through June 2018, an increase of 256,000 on the previous five years, according to data from the Housing Institute of Australia. The 97,000 approvals in the FIRB data account for about 40 percent of the excess, a sign that foreign capital led to more home-building than would otherwise have taken place.\\n\\nDomestic regulators for many years sat on their hands rather than implement macroprudential measures to stop interest-rate cuts pushing the housing market out of control. They're fortunate that foreign buyers spurred this increase in supply, so that housing is gradually rebalancing to become less ruinously expensive.\\n\\nElection time in Australia is a traditional moment to blame foreigners, but the third of the population struggling to make ends meet in rented accommodation should heed that lesson. Regulators and domestic politicians in successive governments did too little to help make housing more affordable. It's foreign investors and retirees who finally took the heat out of Australia's property boom.\", 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'david_fickling@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'David Fickling', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i0ZdGzwECAWo/v1/1200x800.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4762401', 'sentiment': -0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 7}\n",

The Senate in February 2018 rejected an immigration overhaul backed by the White House as well as a bipartisan compromise Trump opposed that would have financed border security and given many young undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship.\\n\\nMcConnell said he also hopes to pass an infrastructure package, but he said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trump need to agree on how to pay for it first.\\n\\n\"The key to it is for the president, the only person in America who can sign something into law, and the Democratic speaker of the House to reach an agreement on a credible pay-for,\" McConnell said. \"Otherwise, it\\'s just talk.\"\\n\\nCongressional Democrats are laying the groundwork for a broad infrastructure package that Pelosi says could seek as much as $2 trillion in new investment for the nation\\'s roads and bridges.

Progressive Democrats have floated a tax on high-frequency financial transactions as one way to fund the plan.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Thursday that he and Pelosi plan to meet with Trump after a two-week Easter recess to talk about infrastructure. He declined to say whether he would endorse any particular funding approach, such as increasing the federal gasoline tax.\\n\\nMcConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, is Transportation secretary, said no one has come up with a credible way to pay for an infrastructure plan yet. \"All I would rule out is what we did in 2009, which is to go out and borrow $900 billion,\" he said, referring to the economic stimulus legislation passed under President Barack Obama.\\n\\nMcConnell said separately that talks have begun among his staff, Pelosi\\'s staff and the White House on a two-year deal on budget caps to clear a path for appropriations. Congress also must increase the debt limit later this year. McConnell said he\\'s still working to pass disaster relief, which has been mired in a dispute over how much to spend on Puerto Rico.\\n\\nMcConnell also said he intends to be \"on offense\" in 2020\\'s Senate races, and that the ideas of progressive Democrats running for president provide easy fodder.\\n\\n\"We\\'re running to be the firewall to save the country from socialism,\" he said. \"You add up things like packing the Supreme Court, getting rid of the Electoral College, the Green New Deal and Medicare for None, and you have a prescription for turning America into something it never has been and never should be.\"\\n\\nHe said Republicans lost the House in 2018 because they lost college-educated voters \"for the first time in my memory\" and women, particularly in the suburbs. \"That is not a path to political success,\" he said.\\n\\nHe added that the growing economy is helpful, but the elections won\\'t turn so much on that as it will the \"deficiencies\" of either party.\\n\\n\"There are not a whole lot of voters who cast gratitude votes,\" he said. \"Generally, they\\'re looking for what the deficiencies are in one side or another.

In a short film projected onto the famous stage just before the show began, Boateng explained that the initials stood not for artificial intelligence, but a trifecta of \"authentic identity,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and \"ancestral identity.\"\\n\\nBoateng, a first-generation British son of Ghanaian immigrants, opted to debut his debut womenswear collection on his own terms. In show notes, the former Givenchy creative director wrote of finding inspiration in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s.\\n\\n\"Keeping up with tradition is good, but I have always held a strong belief that traditions have to evolve otherwise they will eventually die,\" Boateng, 52, wrote.\\n\\nAs models walked to the center of the stage then made a lap around the \"runway\" that were aisles of the theater orchestra section, it was easy to pick up the reverence Boateng has for vintage designs.\\n\\nAlong with obvious sartorial nods to the 1920s, the designer took cues from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. To keep things less costume-y and more current, historical references were juxtaposed with sleek, timeless suiting, giving the entire scene a futuristic vibe. (Again: robots.)\\n\\nIn the unisex show, both men and women wore Black Panther-esque berets tilted to the left. Some were put over printed keffiyehs that flowed with each step.\\n\\nAs expected from a tailor like Boateng, the night became a parade of soome very smart suits. The best were saved for women.\\n\\nOne model\\'s right trouser leg had a slick, straight silhouette, while her right one fanned out into skirt-like pleating. Another wore a pristine white jumpsuit that would have been a little too angelic were it not for two pointy pant creases that toughened things up.\\n\\nThere were also traditionally feminine styles, too, for men and women. One showstopper that came in the middle of the night was a printed maxi with a skirt layered over the top. Boateng paired it with a jade peacock headdress Josephine Baker would have scooped up in a heartbeat.\\n\\nAnother structured suit for men got the gender-fluid treatment with a long, purple skirt overlay.\\n\\nThe night\\'s homage to black culture included a soundtrack that was impossible to not seat dance to, with remixed tracks from James Brown, Prince, and an encore from opera singer John Holiday.\\n\\nBoateng recently dressed Idris Elba for his April wedding to Sabrina Dhowre; the newlyweds sat front row on Sunday night. Also present was the model Adut Aketch, skin pristine after a 24 karat gold mask facial she got to prep for the evening (and, of course, Monday\\'s Met Gala).\\n\\nThe singer Justine Skye also made an appearance in a faded tangerine pantsuit. Boateng utilized a similar rusty hue for many of his designs, making one wonder if burnt copper is the new hot pink.\\n\\nSome vestiges of a typical fashion show remained. A long line stretched outside the Apollo, guest standing in the rain, blocking the entrance to a nearby Red Lobster. Predictably, there was some door drama with ticket barcodes. The show did not start until more than an hour after its 7pm call time.\\n\\nMinor details, really, in the face of the meaning behind Boateng\\'s afrocentric show, which celebrated fashion on the designer\\'s own terms.

I thought not, and in November 2018, wrote \"Housing Forecast: Not A Bubble In 2019.\" This update shows that housing will continue to soften, though not quite so much as previously expected.\\n\\nThe most important factor determining housing construction and pricing is the underlying demographics. Housing is mostly built to accommodate new residents; just a little new construction replaces demolished or abandoned housing. My first gauge of the housing market is construction relative to population growth. The accompanying chart shows how many housing units were started per 100 new residents. New residents come from births in excess of deaths, plus net foreign immigration. The population data include estimates of illegal immigration, though there\\'s obviously some uncertainty there.\\n\\nHousing starts per 100 new residents; Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Census Bureau\\n\\nThis ratio shows we are in the ballpark of building just the right amount of new housing, single-family homes plus apartment units. This is a low-fidelity measure, ignoring factors such as mobile homes shipments, demolitions, and houses abandoned in rural counties as people migrate to cities. Nonetheless, it gets us in the ballpark of whether we are grossly overbuilding or underbuilding.\\n\\nKey to this chart is the slow population growth of recent years. The United States\\' population growth last year was the lowest percentage increase since 1937. Many people in the lumber business think of 1.5 million housing starts as normal, but that was back when population growth was much faster. Today, 1.1 million is a normal year, and we built 1.2 million housing units in 2018, though with a downward trend in the second half.\\n\\nU.S. Population Growth; Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Census Bureau\\n\\nThe other benchmark for current conditions that I watch is housing vacancy rates. They are running about normal for both owned (owner-occupied if not vacant) and rental properties. The quarterly data from the Census Bureau don\\'t align perfectly with other data sources, but they do indicate gross disparities from normal.\\n\\nU.S. housing vacancy rates; Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Census Bureau\\n\\nTo dig deeper into current conditions I look at home prices, measured by the Federal Housing Finance Administration. Home prices have increased in a fairly narrow range averaging about six percent, though the latest data point is quite low. I also watch the price of newly constructed houses and see that homebuilders are moving down-market.\\n\\nU.S. home price appreciation; Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency\\n\\nThe cause of recent weakness is most likely mortgage interest rate increases. From September 2017 through November 2018, the interest rate on 30-year mortgages increased from 3.8% to 4.9%. Sales of existing homes dropped sharply, with about a one-month time lag. Sales of newly built single-family houses peaked just after mortgage rates started rising, then dropped sharply in the following months, hitting a bottom in December 2018. Mortgage rates obviously affect the affordability of a house, but the changes in mortgage rates also affected expectations of future affordability. Homebuilders moved quickly to avoid the worst sting of the higher rates, then returned to the market at the first signs of rates easing.\\n\\nU.S. mortgage interest rate; Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from Federal Reserve\\n\\nThe income part of the homebuying equation has been steadily improving. Disposable income has increased by four to five percent over the past few years, driven by increases in employment and even greater increases in wage rates.\\n\\nU.S. disposable income growth; Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis\\n\\nLooking forward, the demographic trends won\\'t change much, unless the United States suddenly lets in a great many more immigrants. That seems unlikely, even if President Trump is not re-elected in 2020.\\n\\nInterest rates have dropped every month since November 2018. Part of this is a global drop in long-term interest rates, and a secondary factor is the recent Federal Reserve policy shift, which involves both short-term rates as well as the Fed\\'s large portfolio of long-term securities. I expect rates to be level for a few months and then to rise again, as the Fed sees more signs of inflation in the economy.\\n\\nHousehold income growth should continue to be strong. Weakness in employment would most likely be driven by labor shortages rather than soft demand. The labor shortage will continue to drive up wage rates, boosting total income.\\n\\nRolling these factors together, we are currently close to a reasonable range for housing construction, but a little bit high. The slight oversupply will put downward pressure on price appreciation. If I am right that inflation will accelerate - and be warned that this is now a minority view - then higher interest rates will dampen demand. Combining weaker demand with a little too much supply, and home price appreciation will slow. A major price decline is unlikely, but don\\'t expect to make easy money simply owning a house.\\n\\nAs I talk to people about the economy, I hear a range of opinions. The gloomy old men see housing as overpriced and younger people too profligate to be able to afford to purchase a home. The real estate professionals panic at the thought that mortgage rates could rise over five percent, as if we haven\\'t survived much worse. And investors don\\'t understand that the economy is not the same as the stock market. A good solution to the inherent biases that we humans have is to slow down, roll through the fundamental factors, and ignore headlines as much as possible.\\n\\nEditor\\'s Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.', 'source': {'uri': 'seekingalpha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Seeking Alpha'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'bill_conerly@seekingalpha.com', 'name': 'Bill Conerly', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/4/22/saupload_https_3A_2F_2Fblogs-images.forbes.com_2Fbillconerly_2Ffiles_2F2019_2F04_2FYD-2019-04-300x240.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'wgt': 7}\n",

They sat atop rattling boxcars and clung precariously to ladders alongside the clanking couplings. Most were young men, along with a few dozen woman and children. Mothers clambered up the railings clutching their infants. Migrants displayed a Honduran flag from atop the train.\\n\\nThe train known in Spanish as \"La Bestia,\" which runs from the southern border state of Chiapas into neighboring Oaxaca and north into Gulf coast state Veracruz, carried migrants north for decades, despite its notorious dangers: People died or lost limbs falling from the train. Mexican authorities started raiding the trains to pull migrants off in mid-2014 and the number of Central Americans aboard the train fell to a smattering.\\n\\nBut about a week ago, a longtime migrant rights activist, the Rev. Alejandro Solalinde, noticed a change: Large numbers of migrants started getting off the train in Ixtepec, the Oaxaca town where his Brothers on the Road shelter is located.\\n\\nMany had waited weeks for Mexican visas that never materialized, and simply decided to head north without papers. Others were part of a 3,000-person migrant caravan that was broken up in a raid Monday by federal police and immigration agents on a highway east of Ixtepec.\\n\\nWith dozens of police and immigration checkpoints dotting the highways, many migrants now view the train as a safer, albeit still risky, way to reach the U.S. border.\\n\\n\"They\\'re riding the train again, that\\'s a fact,\" said Solalinde, who shelter now houses about 300 train-riding migrants. \"It\\'s going to go back to the way it was, the (Mexican) government doesn\\'t want them to be seen. If the migrants move quietly like a stream of little ants, they\\'ll allow them to, but they are not going to allow them to move through Mexico publicly or massively\" as they did with the large caravans that began in October. In fact, Solalinde predicts \"they\\'re not going to allow caravans anymore.\"\\n\\nIn Monday\\'s raid, federal police and agents detained 367 people, wrestling men, women and children into patrol trucks and vans and hauling them off, presumably to begin deportation proceedings. Many other migrants abandoned the road and fled into the surrounding countryside.\\n\\nThe decision to turn to \"The Beast\" derives from several reasons, all related to the crackdown.\\n\\nWith throngs of police pickups and small immigration vans parked at checkpoints up and down the narrow waist of southern Mexico, hitchhiking, taking buses or walking is no longer an option. Truckers, warned by the government that they could face fines, no longer give rides to the migrants as they did last year. Migrants are pulled off buses, and rounded up off the sides of highways when they stop to rest.\\n\\n\"Now we\\'re going by train because we can\\'t go on buses, because they won\\'t let us through,\" said Rudi Margarita Montoya, the wife of a Honduran carpenter, who was perched atop a freight car with her young son and daughter and her husband.\\n\\nIt\\'s not as if the migrants think the train is safe; they acknowledge the dangers of riding through the darkness perched high atop the freight cars. Just like increased U.S. border protection, Mexico\\'s increased enforcement efforts push migrants into using more dangerous means of travel.\\n\\nCarlos Marroquín, a mechanic from El Salvador, and his wife Brenda Gómez, 24, clambered onto the train with their son, 5 and daughter, 10. Marroquin ticked off the dangers facing them on the rails: \"There are drug traffickers, gangs, thieves, but we\\'re putting everything into this, because it means everything.\"\\n\\n\"If we can\\'t walk, if we can\\'t take the bus, we\\'ll go on the train,\" Marroquin said.\\n\\nDenis Funes, a migrant from central Honduras whose sun-beaten skin and leathery hands betray his past as a farmworker, says he saw a fellow Honduran knocked off the train the previous night by a low-hanging branch that caught the man in the face and sent him hurtling to the tracks below. Funes and his companions could do nothing to help the man; the train was moving too fast to jump off. \"He\\'s still back there somewhere,\" Funes said. But he remains undeterred. \"We\\'re going to rely on the train, despite everything we know that can happen to us.\"\\n\\nGomez and many others were also driven to desperation by another change in Mexican policy. Whereas in late 2018 and early 2019 authorities were handing out humanitarian visas and processing asylum requests, they have now largely stopped doing so, instead making migrants wait weeks in the southern town of Mapastepec for visas that never seem to come.\\n\\nGomez said \"They lied to us, they made us spend a month at the shelter, they told us they were going to give up papers but they never did.\"\\n\\nEnrique Valiente, a 19-year-old roofer from El Salvador who came to the U.S. at 3, spent much of his life in Nevada and was deported last May after a traffic stop. He said Mexico had flatly refused to consider him for asylum. He is afraid to return to his native country -- which he knows little about and where he has almost no remaining relatives -- because he isn\\'t familiar with complex rules of getting along with street gangs in El Salvador, and could fall afoul of them.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t even plan to sneak back into the United States; his dream is to use his perfect English to find work at a call center in the border city of Tijuana. But he can\\'t do that without papers.\\n\\n\"I asked them to consider me for asylum and they just said \\'No, you\\'ve been rejected.\"\\n\\nThe train was popular for years, back when \"caravan\" just meant small Holy Week demonstrations by migrants on the Guatemala-Mexico border. Now, the train is popular once again. Solalinde compared it to trying to squeeze off a leaky garden hose: Wherever Mexican authorities crackdown, the migrants find an alternate route.\\n\\n\"Nobody is ever going to be able to stop the flow of migration,\" Solalinde said.', 'source': {'uri': 'abcnews.go.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@abcnews.go.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_ee429a1fb0214aceb62dd9aedf5f521f_16x9_992.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 6}\n",

Also, male resentment and back to Brexit.\\n\\nTo get John Authers\\' newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.\\n\\nThat was the week that was. We received the usual deluge of month-end economic data, had to digest election results in Spain and the U.K. and, usually most important of all, watched a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that sets U.S. monetary policy. The week also provided a genuine piece of important news, with the end of President Donald Trump\\'s plan to nominate Stephen Moore to be a Federal Reserve governor. But this big event in the real world turned out to be non-event for the markets, while a number of typical data non-events triggered momentous market reactions.\\n\\nThe Moore news played out on Thursday, when in the morning he asserted on Bloomberg TV that he was \"all in\" for the White House\\'s plan to nominate him to a Fed governorship. Moore also denied that he would simply be a presidential puppet, saying that he did not agree with Trump\\'s tweets earlier in the week calling for the target federal funds to be cut by one percentage point and a return to quantitative easing bond buying. Then in the afternoon, Trump announced via tweet that Moore had withdrawn himself from consideration. The market barely twitched. Why? As far as the PredictIt prediction market was concerned, his chances of being confirmed this year had dwindled almost to nothing anyway, and it appears that the wider financial markets agreed:\\n\\nIt is best to ignore complicating but incidental factors, such as a paper trail showing Moore\\'s offensive comments about women in the past. These issues are important, but do not bear on why the nomination mattered to the market.\\n\\nDuring the first two years of his presidency, Trump had toed the line with his nominations to the Fed, putting forward a series of mainstream candidates who might just as easily have been elevated under a Hillary Clinton presidency. The Moore nomination was different. A well-known conservative commentator, he lacked the conventional academic credentials or practical experience for the job, and appeared directly tied to the president. He represented an unambiguous attempt to rein in the Fed\\'s independence, with Trump attempting to push the central bank toward a monetary policy that virtually no reputable economist anywhere on the political spectrum could possibly support.\\n\\nIn this context, it should be a relief to everyone that the political line held against the appointment. The Fed is one of the most divisive and controversial institutions in the world, but at least it is not seen as a political one. There are arguments for making the Fed more politically accountable. But at present, the fact that Republican senators were not prepared to ostensibly put the central bank under Trump\\'s political control is something to celebrate. And it is also impressive that the bond market plainly grasped that the Moore nomination was a step too far and never got too worried about it.\\n\\nIf this incident showed impressive sangfroid, however, the response to the FOMC announcement and to the employment data on Friday was more surprising. The steady month-by-month rise in non-farm payrolls is now arguably the longest period of such stability since the end of World War II.\\n\\nDemocrats cannot argue that the Trump administration has done anything to mess it up, and Republicans cannot say that they have done anything significant to speed up the economy since the end of the Obama administration. The same points can be made for central bankers. Nothing the Fed has done in the last few years of the post-crisis era, whether under Ben S. Bernanke, Janet Yellen or Jerome Powell, has stopped a steady gain in employment, and nothing they have done has sped it up. Last year\\'s interest-rate increases have not messed up the employment picture. Powell said and did nothing following the FOMC meeting on Wednesday to suggest that anything was changing, and the employment data later in the week gave no reason for a change of course. And yet, this week saw a big shift in the market perception for the course of rates. Where once a cut by the end of the year was seen as a two-in-three probability, now it is seen as fifty-fifty, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\nRather than ask what happened last week to alter the perception of future rate cuts, it is more useful to ask why so many seemed to think a rate reduction was in order. The single most relevant part of the employment data for the Fed is the average hourly earnings number. Generally, the idea is that higher wages should lead to faster inflation. The tight labor market, and in particular rising earnings, is exhibit A for those who want the Fed to raise rates. And for April, average rate of earnings growth fell for the second month running:\\n\\nIt is too soon to declare the rising trend over, but if anything the slower pace of wage gains at the margin improved the case for a rate cut, because inflation seemed less of a danger. And yet, as we have seen, the market odds on a cut came down after the data.\\n\\nOne could argue that the classic notion of a trade-off between inflation and unemployment is all wrong. This is know as the Phillips curve relationship, one of the most debated issues in modern macroeconomics. I did a lot of work on the Phillips curve for my old employers at the Financial Times a year ago, which you can read here, here and here. Over time, you can see there does appear to be something of a trade-off, but not an iron-clad one. And it is not clear where causation lies:\\n\\nOne of the more interesting points to come out from my exploration of the academic debate is that earnings inflation is prohibitively difficult to measure. Nobody should ever deploy any money on the basis of a move in wage inflation numbers from one month to another. So I suspect the market\\'s move to reduce the odds of a rate cut owes more than anything else to a belated realization that people had grown far too carried away with the narrative that a rate cut was imminent. Lots of people made and lost money as the market found its way to a more defensible position on the likely future path of rates, but at the end of the week all that had really happened was a slight adjustment in response to a sequence of non-events.\\n\\nOne other question arises from the unemployment data: if there is such steady and consistent growth in employment, why are people so unhappy? A popular answer is that the unemployment data are skewed by the high numbers of people who are no longer looking for work. This is captured by the \"participation rate\" that shows the proportion of the total population who are available to work. This number has dropped significantly in recent years. Some of this is due to the aging of the population. Baby boomers are retiring, and so the participation rate is naturally falling.\\n\\nBut if we look for the total employment rate, by taking the participation rate and then adjusting it for the proportion of those participating who show up as unemployed, we get the following chart:\\n\\nThe picture of a long and steady recovery remains intact. But we are still only back to early 2009. This measure overstates the pain of the current situation slightly, but it does help to explain the level of anger in the population.\\n\\nThat leads to another possible explanation for the level of anger: male resentment. So I tried exploring the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\\'s FRED database, as well as the Bloomberg terminal, to see if this held water. This is the total unemployment rate among men who are looking for work:\\n\\nNote that it has ticked up a little just recently, and that it remains clearly above the levels of the 1960s. But in general, the number of disappointed male job-seekers looks no worse than at previous peaks in the jobs market. But if we compare the total employment rate of all men in the prime working age group between 15 and 64 with the same numbers for women, we can begin to see why men might be significantly unhappier than women with their current predicament:\\n\\nThe role of women in the economy was transformed in the last four decades of the 20th century. This was only partially at the expense of men, but male employment is clearly lower and at the worst point during the Great Recession, it was 20 percentage points worse than it had been during the Eisenhower administration. The recovery since then has still left male unemployment worse than at any point post-war before the Great Recession. So yes, the macro-data do indeed suggest that there are many men who are less productive than their fathers, and have reason to feel angry. That said, women have reason for unhappiness as well. This is the gap between the two lines on the chart above, graphed over time:\\n\\nFemale progress compared to men in the job market froze a decade ago, and the gap has widened slightly. Maybe there really is this large a proportion of the female working-age population that is happy not to have a job, but this seems unlikely. Women are still putting up with unemployment rates 10 points higher than for men. And so it does indeed seem possible, from my extremely swift look at the top-down data, that gender dynamics help explain why improving employment is not making many Americans happier.\\n\\nBrexit is out of the headlines for the time being, but it is bound to return. Britain\\'s politicians still have to agree on a way to leave the European Union by Halloween, and there is every chance that they will fail to do so. The market, however, is settling down.\\n\\nTo return to the worlds of betting and prediction markets, RBC Capital Markets produces this chart of the implicit odds of when a U.K. exit from the EU might take place, along with the odds that the country holds a second referendum on the issue. (Such a referendum would be the only politically viable way for the U.K. to change its mind and decide not to exit at all). As the chart shows, the chance of such a referendum is falling and is near its lows for the last year, but it is still not something that can be dismissed. That is about right, as the opposition Labour party is still not campaigning for a referendum. What is more interesting is the chart on the right on exactly when Brexit might happen:\\n\\nWe have a classic \"twin tails\" probability. The most likely scenarios are that an exit happens in the second half of this year, on the current schedule, or that it does not happen at all, with some possibility of protracted delays ending in an exit at some point over the next two years. The tail on the left makes it hard for sterling to gain much over the next few months, while the tail on the right represents the upside for the currency, and for British assets in general.\\n\\nLooking at sterling, the obvious expression of Brexit anxiety, we can see that it has stayed in a remarkably consistent range, on a trade-weighted basis, ever since referendum night in June 2016, when it dropped more than 10 percent against the dollar. That huge decline has never been reversed:\\n\\nSterling had a good day on Friday, which was roughly equal parts due to a weakening U.S. dollar and excitement when Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour party leader, was quoted saying that local election results showed that the public wanted the main parties to come to a Brexit deal. As his treasury spokesman talked down the possibilities of a deal over the weekend, expect that hope to dwindle in the short term.\\n\\nBut the twin-tailed nature of the Brexit risks is important. U.K. monetary policy is hugely different from what it might have been had the country not voted to leave the E.U. Should the U.K. leave, then monetary policy will stay roughly unchanged. But should the country decide to stay, there is every chance that there could see a huge shift from the Bank of England, which would be very positive for the pound.\\n\\nThe blue line in the following chart shows the gap between the main interest rates set by the BOE and the Fed. The BOE kept rates a quarter-point higher until late 2015. Now, they are 1.75 percentage points lower. Meanwhile, the white line shows the gap between expected inflation over the next 10 years for the two countries. Back in 2013, the U.S. was perceived to have a slightly bigger inflation problem. But since the referendum, a gap has steadily opened, and now U.K. inflation is expected to be 1.4 percentage points higher:\\n\\nThis imbalance would not exist without Brexit. The central bank with higher inflation expectations should be expected to respond with higher interest rates. The only reason the BOE has not done this has been its attempt to guard against a possible economic shock from Brexit. Should the country find a way to get out of Brexit (still unlikely in my view), then sterling could be expected to rally very hard as U.K. rates rose. That would not necessarily be great news for the British economy. It would also be horrible news for anyone who was short sterling. The Brexit political risks have not gone away.\\n\\nMeanwhile, there is the issue of what the EU shorn of its irritating offshore annex will look like. An interesting new research paper for Barings Investment Institute by Christopher Smart makes this bold claim \"The reality is, it\\'s over. Whatever technical economic relationship the United Kingdom chooses to strike with the European Union, it has already effectively left and the continent is moving on without it.\"\\n\\nI am not sure that I agree, but there is certainly no realistic way that the U.K. will be joining in any new attempts to build even closer links between the EU nations, and it is close to inevitable that it will have less influence over continental Europe than it used to have. Smart makes the important point that this will change the EU. The U.S. has long backed British membership in the EU because it shifts the group in a particular \"Anglo-Saxon\" direction, emphasizing the creation of the single market, and championing a relatively light regulation of financial services. Without the U.K., the EU becomes that much more like what Donald Rumsfeld called \"the Old Europe.\"\\n\\nInvestors should start getting used to a Europe that is, on the margin, more likely to regulate economic activity, less likely to negotiate new trade deals and facing a crucial debate about allowing more flexible rules around fiscal policy to boost growth.\\n\\nThis may not be a Europe in which Americans are thrilled to invest, particularly as it could mean a big shift in the way the EU goes about regulating financial services:\\n\\nAn unwritten understanding among European leaders has held that London\\'s views would prevail on financial market issues. Britain had a vital interest in a healthy financial industry and its instincts tended to follow a \"trust markets more, regulate less\" credo. (Similarly, France would have an unofficial veto over agricultural policy and Germany could prevail on important matters of industrial matters.) Now the task of crafting healthy financial markets and boosting economic growth lies primarily in the hands of policymakers in Paris and Berlin.\\n\\nThe EU without the U.K. might be more cohesive. But there is also the risk that without the U.K. to infuriate everyone, we could see far more of a reaction against German economic leadership, which has entailed an aggressively conservative approach to fiscal policy. Italy is close to revolt over the tight budgets required by Brussels, and it is possible others will join the Italians. As Smart says, this - rather than all the exciting secessionist dramas of the moment - could be the most important aspect of European politics for investors to watch:\\n\\nFor investors, the most important immediate signals from this new Europe without Britain will come from any potential shifts in government spending. Budget discipline has been the by-word of European membership, even if often observed in the breach. Today, tight fiscal policy has been a drag on growth. Even now, with Germany recently teetering on recession, the government is running a surplus. Italy\\'s legacy debt is high, but growth is stymied by its own budget surplus after interest payments on debt.\\n\\nIgnore the rhetorical fireworks around immigration or national sovereignty. Instead, watch for any indication of greater flexibility on government spending that will support recovery. That\\'s a far better indicator of the future of Europe than anything going on these days in London.\\n\\nLast week, I directed people to a podcast interview I conducted last year with Emi Nakamura, a macroeconomist now at Berkeley who has done ground-breaking work on the causes and measurement of inflation. Somehow, I managed to do this without noticing that she had just been awarded the John Bates Clark Award. That was quite an oversight, as the Bates Clark is harder to win even than the Nobel. There is only one winner each year and they must be under the age of 40. Even more remarkably, Nakamura is the first macroeconomist to win since Lawrence Summers in 1993 - and the first female macroeconomist to win.\\n\\nBloomberg Opinion colleague Noah Smith was more alert, while you can find all the entries on her in the Marginal Revolution blog kept by another Bloomberg Opinion colleague Tyler Cowen here. You can find a more detailed appreciation of Nakamura here, and there is also a write-up of her award in The Economist.\\n\\nTo add my own appreciation, I have many friends who took her class at Columbia, and know that she is that rare creature who is a great and inspiring teacher as well as a great researcher. Interviewing her was a joy. She is a remarkable mind and it is great that she has been rewarded. I am sorry I did not mention this last week. And it really is worth listening to her explain why we can actually trust inflation data, despite all the many voices saying that we cannot.', 'source': {'uri': 'bloomberg.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bloomberg Business'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'john_authers@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'John Authers', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'for_investors@bloomberg.com', 'name': 'For Investors', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwACY6m5qY9E/v1/1200x1332.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4776355', 'sentiment': -0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 5}\n",

A Chinese delegation is still coming to Washington on Thursday and Friday. \"Mr. Mnuchin said the United States would reconsider imposing higher tariffs on China if the negotiations got \\'back on track,\\' \" Ms. Swanson and Mr. Brasher write.\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nToday\\'s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Jamie Condliffe in London.\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\nAnadarko switches suitors\\n\\nThe energy company, coveted for its U.S. shale oil holdings, said yesterday that it intended to reject Chevron\\'s takeover bid in favor of Occidental\\'s, Clifford Krauss of the NYT reports.\\n\\nOccidental sweetened its offer over the weekend by putting more of it in cash. Its $38 billion bid was already higher than Chevron\\'s first offer of $33 billion. And the extra cash sidestepped the requirement for shareholder approval, happily for Anadarko\\'s board.\\n\\nBut this is \"far from a final decision,\" Mr. Krauss writes. \"Chevron will now have four days to improve its offer, after which Occidental would have several days to revise its bid.\" Chevron has deep pockets, and Anadarko has to pay a $1 billion breakup fee if its offer is rejected, which led analysts at Morgan Stanley to suggest that Chevron could win even without fully matching Occidental\\'s offer.\\n\\n\"Whichever suitor emerges victorious, the sale of Anadarko will be the largest deal in the global oil industry in three years and establish a dominant producer in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the most productive oil field in the world,\" Mr. Krauss adds.\\n\\nMnuchin won\\'t hand over Trump\\'s tax returns\\n\\nThe Trump administration yesterday chose to deny a House request for six years of President Trump\\'s personal and business tax returns, Alan Rappeport of the NYT reports.\\n\\nThe House request \"lacks a legitimate legislative purpose,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the House Ways and Means Committee in a letter yesterday. That, he said, meant he was not authorized to grant access.\\n\\nWhat happens next is unclear. House Democrats could \"file a lawsuit against the Treasury Department, accusing Mr. Mnuchin of not following the law,\" Mr. Rappeport writes, or \"try to access Mr. Trump\\'s returns with a subpoena.\" A protracted court fight looks likely in either case.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Attorney General William Barr has become a punch bag of sorts for Democrats frustrated with Mr. Trump but leery of impeachment. \"The House Judiciary Committee announced a vote for Wednesday that would recommend that the House hold Mr. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for Robert S. Mueller III\\'s full report and evidence,\" Nicholas Fandos and Mr. Rappeport reported in another article.\\n\\nThese \"are only two of a growing number of confrontations between House investigators and Mr. Trump and his administration that are threatening to boil over into court,\" they add.\\n\\nThe Fed warns of risky corporate debt\\n\\nCompanies that already have lots of debt are borrowing at a breakneck pace, and the Fed is uncomfortable about it, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT reports.\\n\\n* \"Loans to companies with large amounts of outstanding debt -- known as leveraged lending -- grew by 20 percent in 2018 to $1.1 trillion, according to the Fed\\'s twice-annual Financial Stability Report.\"\\n\\n* \"The share of new, large loans going to the comparatively risky borrowers now exceeds peak levels reached previously in 2007 and 2014.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what\\'s happening: \"The loans are either held by mutual funds, which pool money from many different investors, or are grouped together and used to back securities called collateralized loan obligations,\" Ms. Smialek writes. These C.L.O.s are then sold to financial institutions.\\n\\n\"A greater proportion are to borrowers with lower credit ratings and already high levels of debt,\" the Fed report, released Monday, explains. \"Any weakening of economic activity could boost default rates and lead to credit-related contractions to employment and investment among these businesses.\"\\n\\nBut this isn\\'t quite 2008 redux. The C.L.O.s are structured in a more secure way than the housing-backed bundles that went bad then, and the Fed says that banks should be able to handle their exposure to corporate debt.\\n\\nChinese spies captured the N.S.A.\\'s weapons\\n\\nChinese intelligence agents acquired N.S.A. hacking tools and repurposed them in 2016 to attack American allies and private companies in Europe and Asia, according to the cybersecurity research firm Symantec.\\n\\nChinese hackers intercepted the tools from an N.S.A attack on their own computers, \"like a gunslinger who grabs an enemy\\'s rifle and starts blasting away,\" Nicole Perlroth, David Sanger and Scott Shane of the NYT write. The tools were then used in cyberintrusions in Belgium, Luxembourg, Vietnam, the Philippines and Hong Kong.\\n\\nThe hacking group is one of the most dangerous Chinese contractors that the N.S.A. tracks, according to a classified agency memo reviewed by the NYT.\\n\\n\"Proliferating cyberconflict is creating a digital wild West with few rules or certainties,\" they continue. And the Chinese action shows \"how difficult it is for the United States to keep track of the malware it uses to break into foreign networks and attack adversaries\\' infrastructure.\"\\n\\n\"The losses have touched off a debate within the intelligence community over whether the United States should continue to develop some of the world\\'s most high-tech, stealthy cyberweapons if it is unable to keep them under lock and key,\" they add.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the CBS News shake-up looks like\\n\\nThe news division\\'s first female president, Susan Zirinsky, made a raft of announcements that signal a new era for the network, John Koblin and Michael M. Grynbaum of the NYT write.\\n\\n* Gayle King will be the new centerpiece of \"CBS This Morning.\"\\n\\n* Norah O\\'Donnell is the next anchor of the \"CBS Evening News,\" only the second woman to hold that role.\\n\\n* Jeff Glor, the current \"CBS Evening News\" anchor, is \"discussing opportunities\" at the network.\\n\\n* \"CBS This Morning\" will also feature two new anchors: Anthony Mason, a co-host of the morning show\\'s Saturday edition, and the CBS correspondent Tony Dokoupil.\\n\\n* John Dickerson, the other morning co-anchor, will slide over to \"60 Minutes.\"\\n\\n\"The shake-up represents the first big stamp by Ms. Zirinsky on the network,\" Mr. Koblin and Mr. Grynbaum write.

But today, the picture has changed. Too much brown bud that can\\'t be sold and not enough green in their financial summaries or ours either.\\n\\nA week ago, I reviewed sixteen cannabis companies for which I had detailed reports from Thomson Reuters.\\n\\nCannabis Stocks: The Massive Gap between Fact and Fantasy\\n\\nThis week, I am reviewing 37 companies. As more broker-dealer analysts provide coverage to the smaller industry companies, I will expand my reviews as well.\\n\\nReaders and clients know my views on the industry, which are mostly negative at this point, but with an understanding, there are strong prospects of success in some cases.\\n\\nObviously, market valuations must come into line with reality. In the market today, there are favorite stocks of investors - let\\'s call them speculators - that are scoffed at by independent business valuators and rightly so.\\n\\nFrom my perspective as a professional investor and portfolio manager, I too have an independent approach to studying the information provided by these companies and, accordingly, have decided to not invest personally or for clients yet. The good news is that corporate earnings and not production capacity is the new focus, not only for investors but for the management teams of these companies.\\n\\nFor this article, I will try to drill down on some of the cannabis companies that I feel may be positioned for future earnings of the kind that would attract me as an investor. You see, I am looking for the real green and not the kind that underlies the hype.\\n\\nIn each case, investors should be thinking what must happen to these companies for this full-on green scenario to come true. That\\'s a discussion all of us must have because so far there are no earnings to speak of.\\n\\nAt the end of the article, I will be inserting comments about the industry and some of these companies that you may or may not find informative. I will also include Reuters information for each of the companies.\\n\\nFor our purposes today, we ranked each of the 37 cannabis companies on earnings, balance sheet, and risk to come up with a fundamental score and on relative valuation and price momentum to come up with a quantitative score. This is a bit of a switch from last week\\'s article. Again, there are no recommendations, just a review of the data from Thomson Reuters, which is mostly historical data and, for this industry, quickly dated.\\n\\nOur Fundamental scores, using both consensus market estimates and company financials, are available to readers for over 5,000 companies we track (free sign-up for our Stock Screener tool).\\n\\nLet\\'s examine the data more deeply.\\n\\nClearly, cannabis is a new and rapidly evolving industry that does not yet measure up to the basic requirements of institutional investors. However, institutional investors are definitely investing as this first table shows, although mostly only in the few stocks that have met NYSE and NASDAQ listing requirements and have the largest market caps.\\n\\nTicker in Canada\\n\\nTicker in USA\\n\\nCompany Name\\n\\nInstitutions own %\\n\\nAPHA.TO\\n\\nAPHA\\n\\nAphria Inc.\\n\\n15,3\\n\\nACB.TO\\n\\nACB\\n\\nAurora Cannabis\\n\\n12,2\\n\\nTRST.TO\\n\\nCTST\\n\\nCannTrust Holdings\\n\\n11,4\\n\\nWEED.TO\\n\\nCGC\\n\\nCanopy Growth Corp.\\n\\n10,3\\n\\nTLRY\\n\\nTilray\\n\\n10,1\\n\\nCRON.TO\\n\\nCRON\\n\\nCronos Group\\n\\n9,4\\n\\nTGOD.TO\\n\\nOTCQX:TGODF\\n\\nGreen Organic Dutchman\\n\\n9,2\\n\\nHEXO.TO\\n\\nHEXO\\n\\nHexo Corp\\n\\n9,1\\n\\nEMH.V\\n\\nOTCQX:EMHTF\\n\\nEmerald Health Therapeutics\\n\\n7,6\\n\\nOGI.V\\n\\nOTCQX:OGRMF\\n\\nOrganigram Holdings\\n\\n6,6\\n\\nVIVO.V\\n\\nOTCQB:VVCIF\\n\\nVivo Cannabis Inc.\\n\\n6,6\\n\\nGENE.V\\n\\nOTCQX:IVITF\\n\\nInvictus MD Strategies Corp.\\n\\n6,2\\n\\nFIRE.TO\\n\\nOTCQX:SPRWF\\n\\nSupreme Cannabis Company Inc.\\n\\n5,1\\n\\nXLY.V\\n\\nOTCQX:CBWTF\\n\\nAuxly Cannabis\\n\\n5,0\\n\\nHIP.V\\n\\nOTCPK:NWKRF\\n\\nNewstrike Brands\\n\\n4,5\\n\\nRIV.V\\n\\nOTCPK:CNPOF\\n\\nCanopy Rivers Inc.\\n\\n3,4\\n\\nEVE.V\\n\\nOTCPK:EEVVF\\n\\nEve & Co Inc.\\n\\n3,3\\n\\nWMD.V\\n\\nOTCPK:WDDMF\\n\\nWeedMD Inc.\\n\\n3,1\\n\\nNDVA.V\\n\\nOTCQX:NDVAF\\n\\nIndiva Ltd.\\n\\n2,9\\n\\nNINE.V\\n\\nOTCQX:VRNDF\\n\\nDelta 9 Cannabis Inc.\\n\\n2,7\\n\\nSCYB.V\\n\\nScythian Biosciences Corp.\\n\\n2,6\\n\\nMETA.V\\n\\nOTCPK:NACNF\\n\\nNational Access Cannabis Corp.\\n\\n2,5\\n\\nHVT.V\\n\\nOTCPK:HRVOF\\n\\nHarvest One Cannabis Inc.\\n\\n2,4\\n\\nGTEC.V\\n\\nOTCQB:GGTTF\\n\\nGTEC Holdings\\n\\n1,9\\n\\nN.V\\n\\nOTCQB:NXTTF\\n\\nNamaste Technologies Inc.\\n\\n1,8\\n\\nTBP.V\\n\\nOTCQB:TBPMF\\n\\nTetra Bio-Pharma Inc.\\n\\n1,8\\n\\nIN.TO\\n\\nOTCQX:IMLFF\\n\\nInMed Pharmaceuticals\\n\\n1,7\\n\\nLABS.V\\n\\nOTCQX:MEDIF\\n\\nMedipharm Labs Corp.\\n\\n1,6\\n\\nALEF.TO\\n\\nOTCQX:ALEAF\\n\\nAleafia Health Inc.\\n\\n1,5\\n\\nKHRN.V\\n\\nOTCQB:KHRNF\\n\\nKhiron Life Sciences Corp.\\n\\n1,5\\n\\nNRTH.V\\n\\nOTCPK:NCNNF\\n\\n48North Cannabis Corp.\\n\\n0,1\\n\\nPCLO.V\\n\\nPharmaCielo Ltd.\\n\\n0,1\\n\\nFLWR.V\\n\\nOTCPK:FLWPF\\n\\nFlowr Corp.\\n\\n0,0\\n\\nSOW.V\\n\\nOTCPK:QILFF\\n\\nOrganic Flower Investments Group\\n\\n0,0\\n\\nSUGR.V\\n\\nOTC:RLLRF\\n\\nSugarBud Craft Growers Corp.\\n\\n0,0\\n\\nWL.V\\n\\nOTCQB:WSLFF\\n\\nWestleaf Inc.\\n\\n0,0\\n\\nZENA.V\\n\\nOTCPK:ZBISF\\n\\nZenabis Global Inc.\\n\\n0,0\\n\\nIt would not be a surprise one day to see The Green Organic Dutchman (TGOD.TO and OTCQX:TGODF) be listed in New York.\\n\\nEarnings Ratings do not correspond to absolute earnings but are based on Earnings Surprises, Estimate Revisions, and Analyst upgrades and downgrades of earnings in the past four months.

Every week or so, Reuters reports on more companies and the data changes as well for many of these companies, week to week.\\n\\nIn subsequent articles, I may decide to include my one-month forward outlook for the stock price trend. Anything longer would be pure guesswork on my part.\\n\\nIn summary, gathering this information for public information and discussion is a learning experience for all of us. I am not yet ready to trade these stocks, but as I complete the development of a proprietary algorithm that meets my needs, I shall consider that.\\n\\nComments on the industry and some of the companies\\n\\nAll negatives aside and the industry has many, I have projected that sometime around 2025-2026, total sales of cannabis will exceed the annual production of gold. And for many companies in cannabis one way or another, there will be green, and millions of investors will be pleased with their results.\\n\\nFor thousands of years, cannabis the medicine and cannabis for getting stoned has been popular in society if not fully legal. Because of Canada\\'s leadership under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, societal forces are rapidly changing around the world. In fact, there are laws in place in more than 30 countries now in support of medical cannabis and legalized recreational use is becoming widely accepted as well.\\n\\nThere are many facets to any industry, and that is certainly the case with cannabis. Products are also being derived from the non-hallucinogenic CBD flower and oils and going into the making of consumer products like edibles, cannabis-infused beverages, concentrates used in vaping, and creams and lotions among so many others. The industry includes businesses that operate throughout the seed-to-consumption chain involving the making, marketing, and delivery of cannabis products.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, cannabis is becoming a global trillion-dollar sub-industry of many industries. So, we are right to be researching, writing, and discussing it here in 2019. We are also right to be constructively critical.\\n\\nThere have been so many published reports and articles that present inflated sales numbers that at times there will be periods of consolidation, which is a fact of life in any market. We are witnessing softer sales quite recently in fact. Health Canada, the regulatory arm of the federal government, reported that cannabis sales in Canada actually dropped in January and February this year, counter to what most readers of the industry hype had believed possible. After Aphria reported in their most recent report that sales had fallen, bewildered investors hammered the stock price.\\n\\nMore of that to come. Just not to worry.\\n\\nAs part of Canada\\'s leadership in cannabis, the biggest companies in this industry have gained listings on the NYSE and NASDAQ. You may have noted that each of the seven large Canadian cannabis companies that are now listed there are presented to the public as in the medical cannabis space. True, they are; however, they are also in the retail cannabis space, although that is not what they want the US regulators to be seeing. Why build needless hurdles when running track?\\n\\nWhen traveling south, these Canadian executives do not wish to be arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers for their promotion to the American public of a federally illegal drug, especially where the corporate taxes are paid in Canada. Yes, it\\'s all about taxation. Isn\\'t that the business of government?\\n\\nThere are some big deals happening and some almost happening, many of which are cross-border deals. A hostile take-over bid on Dec. 27 by US cannabis retailer Green Growth Brands (GGB.CA and GGBXF), which is financed by the Schottenstein family of Ohio, ultimately failed to acquire Canada\\'s Aphria. The irony is that Green Growth Brands is listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange, now referred to as the Cannabis Stock Exchange because they now have 160 such listings and counting.\\n\\nThe original all-stock bid from Green Growth Brands valued Aphria at C$2.8 billion or C$11 per Aphria shares based on the share exchange ratio of 1.5714 Green Growth shares for each Aphria share. This bid was rejected. Then GGB made a second all-stock hostile bid for Aphria a couple months later, valuing it at C$2.35 billion based on the same exchange ratio of 1.5714 Green Growth shares for each Aphria share. This week, that proposed take-over died and Aphria should receive a break fee of C$89.0 million.\\n\\nThe lawyers and accountants are happy campers.\\n\\nThat proposed deal is the start of what I anticipate are a number of hostile take-over plays in this emerging industry. However, one friendly deal was consummated recently.\\n\\nAleafia Health Inc. (TSXV: ALEF, OTC: ALEAF, FRA: ARAH) and Emblem Corp. (TSXV: EMC, OTCQX: EMMBF) have amalgamated. Each Emblem shareholder is to receive 0.8377 of a common share in Aleafia. The company was pleased to state that the deal creates:\\n\\nThe leading Canadian medical cannabis clinic and education centre network with 60,000 patients seen to date. A high-value, highly differentiated product portfolio of oils, capsules, and sprays. Scaled production capacity and leading supply with three dedicated cultivation and product innovation facilities and the industry\\'s largest LP to LP cannabis supply agreement. A national and global distribution platform with provincial supply agreements, retail partnerships, and a global expansion. Improved capital markets profile and liquidity, including up-listing to the TSX. A combined entity with a robust cash position.\\n\\nOne problem that investors have still is that most cannabis companies are too small to be followed by sufficient number of analysts to meet the minimal requirements of Big Data companies like Thomson Reuters to provide us detailed reports. Moreover, the industry is so new that as broker-dealer analysts initiate coverage some of their opinions are complete opposites. Analysts at Bank of America and Jefferies told us totally different stories about Quebec-based HEXO. Bank of America called Hexo its \"top pick in the industry\", with a price target of C$14.00 (US$10.48) whereas Jefferies called Hexo a \"Sell\" with a price target of just C$5.60 (US$4.25), which was bumped slightly after Hexo acquired the Newstrike Brands company.\\n\\nWhile some analysts disagree, Jefferies has a \"conviction buy\" rating on CannTrust Holdings Inc. (TRST and CTST) with a price target at a healthy C$15 (US$11).\\n\\nAll these developments are interesting in that in the case of Hexo they have a joint venture with Molson Coors Brewing to produce non-alcoholic cannabis-infused beverages to come to market before the end of the year. MBA marketing students are drooling over the prospects of line extension in this emerging and rapidly evolving industry.\\n\\nNot everything is going the way these companies have been selling their stories though. Cannabis packaging company KushCo Holdings Inc. (USOTC: KSHB) reported larger Q2 losses even on revenue that more than tripled. Moreover, the accounting systems of this company are somewhat dubious as the company now is to file new financial summaries for 2017 and 2018. This is not good for a company that is seeking a major exchange listing.\\n\\nI suspect there will be more of that to come because many of these small companies appear to be run by the seat of the pants.\\n\\nAs I spend a few hours each week now looking into this industry, some associates have sent me some under-the-radar names to consider. You probably get the same smile and wink treatment too. In my case, I will follow up although certainly not to promote them or begin to trade them.\\n\\nTwo others on my radar are Charlotte\\'s Web and MedMen. In fact, MedMen is a positive story of young guys, starting from nothing in the US and making it big. Not one story like it in Canada. I wish more analysts would follow companies like these.\\n\\nAnother such stock that came to my attention this weekend is General Cannabis Corp. I\\'m told it may possibly become a winner with its plan to become the specialist in distillate. The company may also become a cannabis cultivator, but their plan is to process hemp and cannabis into CBD, THC, CBC and CBG distillate. The play of being the \"converter\" with economies of scale and process is likely to be a good business for CBD.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Sure, rainbow bagels are fun for the 'gram, but to me, nothing beats the allure of a perfectly baked baguette or a sourdough fresh out of the oven. That's why I set out to find the most legendary bread in New York City.Spencer: Hey guys, it's Spencer, and today I'm at Orwashers Bakery. This place has been making some of the most legendary bread in New York City for over 100 years. Today, the owner, Keith, is actually gonna show me how they do it. I'm super nervous because I don't cook. Let's go!Narrator: Orwashers was founded in 1916 by Abraham Orwasher, a Hungarian immigrant determined to bring quality eastern European breads to his local community. Since being sold to its current owner in 2008, the business has expanded to two brick-and-mortar locations, plus a massive wholesale production facility, which makes bread for some of the biggest restaurants in NYC.\\n\\nHimani (customer): This is definitely one of the best bakeries in New York City, and it's our favorite bakery on the Upper West Side.[Off-camera]: Which one do you love?\\n\\nNarrator: To learn how Orwashers makes its legendary bread, I met up with owner Keith Cohen. His award-winning baguettes are mixed every morning at 5 a.m. and rest for over 24 hours before being shaped in a molder.\\n\\nSpencer: Is it typical to shape the baguette with a machine instead of by your hand?\\n\\nKeith: It is. I mean, for a home baker or very, very small bakery with limited space, you could easily do it by hand. This is a very efficient way, and for this particular baguette, it works very well.\\n\\nSpencer: OK, I feel like I kinda wanna try one with my own hands, just to see if I can beat the machine. I mean...\\n\\nKeith: We're gonna have the super experienced baker, the mediocre baker, and the novice.\\n\\nKeith: That's OK. That means there's still air in the dough. It's great. Wanna pop it?\\n\\nSpencer: I don't wanna pop it.\\n\\nKeith: It's not gonna be like the bubble wrap, you're not gonna get the same amount of joy out of it.\\n\\nKeith: The couche. Flip my disaster over, and now I think John will come over and also try his hand, or hands, at it.\\n\\nSpencer: Yeah, John, get in here. Oh, he's gonna really show us up right now.\\n\\nJohn: There's many ways to shape a baguette. Many different ways, this is one of them.\\n\\nSpencer: But we have to see how they come out of the oven. I mean, it's all about the finished product.\\n\\nKeith: You're correct.\\n\\nSpencer: And a lot can happen in the oven, if I've learned anything from baking shows on Netflix.\\n\\nKeith: See, these are more hand-shaped, I can tell.\\n\\nSpencer: Yes, you can tell because they look not nearly as good as the ones from the machine.\\n\\nKeith: OK, and we kind of know these were ours, why? Little bit longer, little skinnier, you can see the stretch marks, you can even see the flour.\\n\\nKeith: That is a combination of many things: our mixing technique, or less mixing, hydration, and fermentation. But you did a great job.\\n\\nSpencer: And this actually isn't it because this is just one small part of your operation, right?\\n\\nNarrator: Although most locals think of Orwashers as a neighborhood institution, the massive wholesale production facility is the real heart of the operation.\\n\\nKeith: Well, in a couple years, I don't think I'll need the hairnet, so that makes things a little easier.\\n\\nNarrator: The factory is split into three separate areas for mixing, shaping, and baking.\\n\\nKeith: Much like yesterday, we are mixing in a far bigger mixer. This can make a lot of bread, a lot of dough.\\n\\nSpencer: How many loaves do you think you'll get out of something this size?\\n\\nKeith: Well, I mean, right now we're mixing a couple hundred pounds so could essentially get probably 150 loaves.\\n\\nNarrator: Before the shaped dough is ready for the oven, it makes a pit stop to the humidity-controlled proofing room.\\n\\nNarrator: After proofing and fermenting for various amounts of time, depending on the type of dough, everything eventually makes its final destination into the oven room.\\n\\nKeith: Right, so you have your deck oven and your three convection ovens, or rack ovens, and this is where all the bread is baked, and then we move it a little bit over to cool it.\\n\\nSpencer: So I have a question for you. At what point does dough become bread, is that in the oven?\\n\\nKeith: It starts from the time you mix it, OK. It is once that yeast is added, and that organism starts to eat the sugars and starches, it is from the time of inception, really.\\n\\nNarrator: After two full days of nothing but bread, I was exhausted and blissfully carbed out. But that didn't stop me from taking one for the road.\\n\\nSpencer: Fresh out of the oven, baked bread just for me? Oh, my God, that's amazing!\", 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jake_gabbard@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'Jake Gabbard', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'spencer_alben@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'Spencer Alben', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c8fbad32730ca2d972800e9-1920-960.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.3490196078431373, 'wgt': 5}\n",

The star tweeted the following:\\n\\nFans were quick to connect Wu\\'s tweets with the same day announcement that FOTB was renewed for a sixth season. Wu commented \"dislike\" on the show\\'s Instagram page, which makes her feelings pretty clear cut:\\n\\nWhether or not you like FOTB or Constance Wu, her outburst was unprofessional. After all, plenty of actors are struggling with the cancellation of their series (or struggling to find work at all), while Wu is in the prime of her career. Secondly, the series renewal means that the hundreds of cast and crew members that work on the series get another year of employment: that\\'s nothing to roll your eyes at.\\n\\nLook, unless you\\'re completely anonymous on social media, it\\'s poor form to trash your job, no matter how shitty it may be (and will likely lead to you getting fired). But trashing a show publicly on social media, when your career was launched because of said job, is not a good look. And then there\\'s this sip of tea, courtesy of Wu\\'s Crazy Rich Asians co-star Gemma Chan:\\n\\nChan quickly responded that the like was accidental which, sure Jan:\\n\\nBut drama aside, are we being too hard on Wu? After all, everyone has the right to complain about their job, even actors. And Wu may very well feel frustrated at missing out on career opportunities, especially since Crazy Rich Asians has made her a hot commodity. Everyone has bad days, and who among us has not tweeted some pettiness out into the world?\\n\\nThere may also be things happening behind the scenes at FOTB that Wu doesn\\'t like. Inkoo Kang wrote a piece on the show for Slate, where she describes the dumbing-down of Wu\\'s character Jessica.\\n\\nKang writes, \"The actress is as nimble as ever, but sometime last year, the writers seem to have forgotten what makes Jessica such a brilliant character. She still gets to throw flames, but now she\\'s forced to apologize for them, repeatedly. Her self-possession coarsened into self-absorption, Jessica has become yet another immature character in need of life lessons, alongside her middle- and high-school-age children. It\\'s a humiliating (and groan-inducing) turn, with insulting implications for the immigrant culture she represents.\"\\n\\nIf that is the case (I haven\\'t watched the show in several seasons) it\\'s disappointing. Jessica is a terrific character and Wu is frequently the MVP of the series. If they are turning Jessica into a caricature, no wonder Wu is upset about a renewal.\\n\\nWu quickly released a statement saying that while she enjoys working on FOTB, its renewal meant she had to pass up on a film project she was excited about:\\n\\nIt\\'s a thoughtful apology and reponse, but we\\'ll have to wait and see if Wu\\'s comments have any impact on the future of the series.

It was constructed on a storied site, the infamous former home of the Bethlehem Royal Hospital, also known as \"Bedlam,\" Britain\\'s first hospital for the mentally ill.\\n\\nOver the years, the stylish, Gothic, red-brick hotel housed various luminaries, both real and fictional -- including Van Helsing, Bram Stoker\\'s intrepid vampire hunter, who resided here in Stoker\\'s first Dracula novel. Postcards were produced of the hotel\\'s façade. Sea water was transported by train, so guests could enjoy healing salt-water baths.\\n\\nBut as Shoreditch devolved, so did the hotel, and by the time current owner, Sir Terence Conran, checked into the place in the 1980s, it had become a flophouse. \"It was in the most disgraceful, derelict condition,\" remembers Conran, a well-known designed and renaissance man. \"They asked me, \\'how many hours do you want?\\'\" So he bought the hotel, gutting and transforming it, reopening as the world\\'s first Andaz, Hyatt\\'s boutique brand.\\n\\nAnd they\\'ve just undergone another extensive renovation, carried out in 19 stages and finished this past year with the completion of their 860-square-foot RED Suite, designed by Conran himself, spacious and comfortable and filled with personal touches. Given the historic nature of the hotel and the level of design work that has gone into it, the hotel was a shoo-in for Beast Travel\\'s twice-monthly hotel feature The New Room with a View. (Like other RED projects, 30 percent of the room rate is donated to help fight AIDS.)The suite, like the rest of the hotel, aims to reflect Shoreditch and all of East London, bringing the outside into its restaurants and 267 rooms -- of which, no two are the same. The area was once a hub for industries like silk weaving and coffee, which was offloaded nearby from ships on the Thames, and those elements are reflected in the artwork and etchings. Larger than most in London, the rooms are also equipped with modern conveniences -- including flat-screen TVs and, a new addition, large walk-in showers.\\n\\nBedlam even gets its due at the hotel\\'s Rakes Café Bar, adorned with A Rake\\'s Progress, eight works, reflecting eight stages of the mind, by 18th-century painter William Hogarth which trace the moral decline and ruin of Tom Rakewell -- who ended up in the Bethlehem Royal. Rakes is divided into three sections -- The Front Room, where DJs spin and people dance, The Lounge, a cushy, luxe space, perfect for a comfortable cocktail, and No. 3, a \"secret room\" for private parties. The original hotel was even built with two Masonic temples, and one of which, grand and strange, has been reopened and renovated -- it\\'s now used for morning yoga,Game of Thrones-themed dinners, and Lady Gaga even did a photo shoot there.\\n\\nAnd as this area of London revived over the past two decades, with hipsters moving in all around -- building a nearby, semi-ironic bowling alley and lounges and bars and barbershops -- that\\'s reflected, too, with photos of graffiti, and tattoo artwork embossed on headboards. Guests are encouraged to get outside and see this renaissance. I wandered down Brick Lane, long a destination for new immigrants and industry, from breweries to textile shops, and now home to that bowling alley, and cafes and craft beer bars, where hipsters and immigrants now live side-by-side.\\n\\nI have lunch at the Old Spitalfields Market, which dates all the way back to 1638, and has traditionally traded in fruits and vegetables. Renovated in the last couple years, they still sell fresh produce out of Victorian buildings, but now also welcome those seeking antiques and vintage eyewear and handcrafted skincare products, plus 40-some food outlets, from street food and gourmet burgers to farm-to-table fare.\\n\\nAnd I even take a street art tour, arranged by the hotel and led by a local graffiti artist. In addition to showing me his own work, Karim Samuels leads me down streets and around corners and down alleyways, giving the background on a number of other local paintings and their creators, explaining the different types of graffiti art, from simple tags to full-colour murals. At one point he gets a bit deep about the meaning behind it all, and the line that these artists still straddle between fashionable -- and criminal. \"Street art is analog social media,\" he explains, with a smile. \"People have been writing on walls for thousands of years -- but try telling that to a judge.\" We finish with the area\\'s piece-de-la-resistance, pink Porsche near Brick Lane painted by Banksy and, Samuels says, dropped here in the middle of the night, by crane.\\n\\nI haven\\'t been doing anything so heroic as fighting vampires but, tired from the walking and saturated with information, I head back to the Andaz. Rather than sea water bath, there\\'s walk-in shower, and then a cocktail waiting for me at Rakes. And then a comfortable night in my unique room, far removed from the Bedlam of the bustling city outside.', 'source': {'uri': 'thedailybeast.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Beast'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'tim_johnson@thedailybeast.com', 'name': 'Tim Johnson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1556405186/190428-johnson-room-with-a-view-andaz-shoreditch-hero_sbrpso', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1058823529411765, 'wgt': 5}\n",

It's also a wakeup call for investors. Privacy does not exist, not even in Europe.\\n\\nThe amount of data that will soon become searchable is staggering. Identity records, including date of birth particulars and passport information, will get linked to fingerprint and facial scan records.\\n\\nAll told, Eurodac, the fingerprint database for asylum seekers; Visa Information System; and Schengen Information Systems, the giant database used by 31 European countries for law enforcement and border control, will be linked to three new databases governing criminal records for third party nationals, the entry/exit system and a travel authorization system.\\n\\nAt the click of a virtual button, border control and police offers will be able to pull up information, including biometric data on 350 million people.\\n\\nThe new centralized database is a big step for privacy-conscious Europe. It establishes a common registry for biometric data for all of its citizens, as well as for those who wish to visit as tourists. More important, it's the shape of things to come.\\n\\nThe global community often criticizes China for the state's efforts keep tabs on citizens. In 2018, the government announced that facial scanning systems were capable to tracking every person in Beijing, a city of 21.5 million people, according to a New York Times report.\\n\\nIn addition to extending these systems through the country of 1.4 billion, new software systems will link the information to financial, travel and social media data. The end result will be a social credit score to differentiate good Chinese citizens from undesirable ones.\\n\\nIn India, the government successfully implemented Aadhaar, a digital identification system backed by fingerprints and facial scans. The database, run by the unique identification authority of India, houses information on 1.2 billion Indians, and is widely considered to be the largest information technology project ever attempted.\\n\\nThere have been benefits, too. Just as the early adoption of mobile helped the Chinese build a lead in mobile payments, the digitalization of India promises radical advances in banking, given reduced levels of fraud.\\n\\nWith Aadhaar, Indians can easily open bank accounts with their fingerprint, move money and pay bills, and buy mutual funds, investments and insurance. They can also move around the country more freely, assured their financial assets will remain in tow.\\n\\nThe CIR is not that. In many ways, it's the opposite.\\n\\nThe European parliament wants to track people moving in and out of the EU because lawmakers are fearful that people who will do harm are slipping through the cracks. They are turning to draconian, authoritative practices because it's more politically expedient to be too safe, rather than not safe enough.\\n\\nIt's the lesson investors should have learned long ago. The surveillance state is real. In the future it will be universal, and unavoidable because it makes people feel safer.\\n\\nCities will be blanketed with cameras.

Since March 2018, the firm has been representing President Trump as Trump faces a federal lawsuit over his undivested business interests. Consovoy has been acting as the president\\'s personal lawyer. On April 5, Consovoy sent a letter to the Treasury Department, arguing that the House Ways and Means Committee has no \"legitimate committee purpose\" for requesting the president\\'s income tax returns. Consovoy requests that forcing the president to hand over his income tax returns would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" Here\\'s what you need to know:\\n\\nEarlier this week, Democrats in the House formally requested the past six years of the president\\'s income tax returns. Democrats say that the request had nothing to do with politics. But Consovoy, who said the president would not be handing over his tax information, said the request amounted to an \"abuse of power.\" He wrote,\\n\\n\"It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass and intimidate their political opponents. Once this Pandora\\'s box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.\"\\n\\nConsovoy represented the nonprofit group Students for Fair Admissions Inc in a lawsuit filed against the president of Harvard University. The lawsuit charged that Harvard had violated the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against Asian Americans in their admissions policy. The plaintiffs were backed by the Department of Justice and also by the Federalist Society. Harvard was backed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. The university claimed that it had a right to take race into consideration as part of its admissions policy, since, it argued, providing a diverse environment benefited all its students.\\n\\n<hr.\\n\\nConsovoy\\'s law firm represented a group called \"Speech First,\" a non-profit organization that filed a lawsuit last year against the University of Michigan. Speech First charged that the university\\'s anti-harassment rules violated free speech and freedom of expression. The group also charged that the University of Michigan\\'s \"Bias Response Team\" -- a campus group which investigates bias complaints -- had overstepped and was making it difficult for many members of Speech First to express themselves. The group wrote, in a press release last year:\\n\\n\"In light of these policies, Speech First members enrolled at Michigan have abstained from speaking on topics including immigration, identity politics, and abortion because they fear their speech will be anonymously reported as offensive, biased, and/or hateful to university authorities through the bias response system. The complaint alleges that these hopelessly vague policies chill student speech and expression - a clear First Amendment violation.\"\\n\\nConsovoy specializes in constitutional law and federal law. He\\'s argued several cases before the Supreme Court, including argued Spokeo v. Robbins and Evenwel v. Abbott -- before the Supreme Court of the United States.\\n\\nConsovoy served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and also clerked for Judge Edith H.

Consovoy has won a number of accolades for his work; he\\'s been named a \"rising star\" by Law 360 and has been ranked one of the leading appellate lawyers in the nation by Chambers and Partners.\\n\\nConsovoy teaches occasional classes at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason Univerisity, where he is a co-director of the Administrative Law Clinic and the Supreme Court Clinic.

House prices are predicted to fall 20 percent in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank Ltd., and rents are now growing at the slowest pace in records dating back to the early 1970s:\\n\\nThe share of Australians saying that housing affordability is one of their top three issues has also fallen to its lowest level since before the last election in 2016, according to Essential Report polling:\\n\\nEven for those on low incomes, things appear to be turning. While Sydney is still an alarmingly expensive city, the number of properties advertised for rent at 30 percent or less of a typical minimum-wage income has doubled in less than two years to more than a fifth of total advertisements, according to a report this week by Anglicare Australia:\\n\\nOne response might be to assume it's because the great foreign invasion has finally been beaten back. In truth, it's close to the opposite: The wave that broke across the country in recent years has bailed Australian governments and regulators out of their own policy mistakes.\\n\\nForeign -- particularly Chinese -- spending on Australian real estate has certainly been significant. Chinese investment rose more than 10-fold between 2010 and 2016 to hit A$32 billion ($23 billion), enough on its own to represent nearly 15 percent of total reportable external investment in the country, according to data from the Foreign Investment Review Board or FIRB, a government regulator. In recent years, about a quarter of all overseas real estate investment has come from mainland China.(1) That rises to a third or more if you include Hong Kong and Singapore -- popular conduits for mainland investors.\\n\\nYet that spending has had little effect on the existing housing stock because of restrictions on overseas investment. Foreigners are normally allowed to buy established homes in Australia only if they have a residency visa; they must sell when that paperwork expires. Such purchases rarely account for more than a percentage point or so of the almost 500,000 home sales taking place each year.\\n\\nWhere overseas money does make a difference is in new housing, for which the rules are much more open. In the five years through June 2018, the FIRB granted 97,000 approvals for foreigners to buy undeveloped residential properties, with a total value of around A$179 billion.\\n\\nThat's helped the country in two ways. First, home sales sit alongside tourism, education and the export of iron ore, coal, natural gas and gold as one of Australia's biggest sources of foreign capital. Perhaps more importantly, though, those inflows have led to a boom in home-building that's one of the main reasons the country's housing bubble is now gently deflating.\\n\\nAs we've written, the construction splurge between 2015 and 2017 was a unique period in recent Australian history when housing starts ran consistently ahead of household formation. That was driven heavily by two reviled categories of investors, foreigners and baby boomers, who encouraged a wave of apartment-building that's changed the skyline of the country's cities.\\n\\nAbout 1.03 million homes were started in the five years through June 2018, an increase of 256,000 on the previous five years, according to data from the Housing Institute of Australia. The 97,000 approvals in the FIRB data account for about 40 percent of the excess, a sign that foreign capital led to more home-building than would otherwise have taken place.\\n\\nDomestic regulators for many years sat on their hands rather than implement macroprudential measures to stop interest-rate cuts pushing the housing market out of control. They're fortunate that foreign buyers spurred this increase in supply, so that housing is gradually rebalancing to become less ruinously expensive.\\n\\nElection time in Australia is a traditional moment to blame foreigners, but the third of the population struggling to make ends meet in rented accommodation should heed that lesson. Regulators and domestic politicians in successive governments did too little to help make housing more affordable. It's foreign investors and retirees who finally took the heat out of Australia's property boom.\\n\\n(1) The figure includes commercial as well as residential real estate.\\n\\nTo contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.net\\n\\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.net\\n\\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\\n\\nDavid Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

But these days, it's seaplane sojourns that are all the rage, not least from Miami and especially to the Bahamas and the Florida Keys. As with the helicopter flights, it's not about YOLO bragging rights and tartly hashtagged Instagram posts from the sky -- or at least not just about those things. It's also plain convenient, cutting down on transit time, traffic frustrations and wasted hours waiting in lines and on commercial airline delays.\\n\\nBlade, the Hamptons helicopter service that launched in spring 2014, began operating in South Florida the following winter, and the company reports that growth has been exponential there over the last year. Last winter, it started offering regularly scheduled weekend service between Miami and Palm Beach, with #flyblade fans also chartering and crowdsourcing planes to Bahamian destinations including Harbour Island and Baker's Bay.\\n\\nSouth Florida operator Tropic Ocean Airways saw growth of 31 percent from 2017 to 2018. Clients rely on its services to avoid slow-moving lines of cars on the one-lane highway down to the Keys, and to skip long security and immigration waits for the Bahamas. Tropic offers scheduled flights to several Bahamian islands and can handle charters anywhere within a 300-mile radius of Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\\n\\nAnd just where are the well-heeled headed on their seaplane vacays? Here are the most exciting new destinations in the Bahamas and the Keys drawing folks south from Miami for some splashy R&R.\\n\\nAfter years of development, Nassau's $4.2 billion, 1,000-acre Baha Mar is now fully up and running. The final major hotel piece, a 237-room Rosewood resort -- which joined a 299-room SLS and an 1,800-room Grand Hyatt -- debuted in the middle of last year. And now, luxe Baha Mar Residences are for sale, ranging from one-bedroom studios to eight-bedroom waterside villas. (And what better way to arrive at your new pied-á-plage than by seaplane?)\\n\\nThose who buy into the residences will enjoy special access to Baha Mar's extensive amenities, not least of which is its 100,000-square-foot casino, a private island, a 213-foot superyacht, top-flight shopping and a club co-founded by Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake. Among the hot boîtes at Baha Mar, Skybar (Nassau's only hotel rooftop bar) and Carna (the first spot outside Italy for Tuscan meat master Dario Cecchini), both at the SLS, are the latest arrivals. They join a Philippe Starck-designed Katsuya -- and more than 40 other restaurants, bars and lounges in the development.\\n\\nBeyond Nassau, the quieter pleasures of the Out Islands also have much to recommend them these days. On the pink-sand enclave of Harbour Island -- known as the home (or at least one of the homes) of style-setters Diane von Furstenberg and Elle Macpherson -- Coral Sands Hotel unveiled a major makeover of its beachfront cottages and Moroccan-inflected restaurant. Great Exuma's Grand Isle Resort and Spa, for its part, just opened a new beach club last month. The club's indoor-outdoor restaurant, infinity pool on Emerald Bay and plush cabanas are available to hotel guests as well as by day pass, making it a perfect spot to seaplane into for the quickest of getaways.\\n\\nThe string of islands stretching southeast from the tip of Florida have seen a surge of development in the past several years, only fleetingly paused by 2017's Hurricane Irma.\\n\\nIsla Bella Beach Resort -- on Knights Key, at the east end of Seven Mile Bridge -- opened earlier this month. The top-flight, white-clapboard hotel sits on 24 secluded, waterfront acres and boasts five pools, four dining spots (including a flagship Italian restaurant), almost a mile of private coastline and its own beach. That's all for the guests of just 199 rooms, each of them decorated in soothing shades of white and blue, with ocean views to match. A 4,000-square-foot spa and 1,000-square-foot fitness center debut next month.\\n\\nA few islands back toward Miami, Hawks Cay reopened on Duck Key last summer after a yearlong, post-hurricane closure and $50-million refit of its 177 rooms, lobby and restaurant. The redesign takes inspiration from the work of Morris Lapidus, the Miami Modern architect who created the original hotel here. The reimagined property now features an expanded adults-only zone with its own pool, bar, restaurant, outdoor lounge and firepit.\\n\\nEven closer to the mainland, Bungalows Key Largo opened late last year on 1,000 feet of shoreline as the region's first all-inclusive hotel. Sensing the seaplane trend, the resort has partnered with Staniel Air to create a three-night package that offers transfers to and from Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport. Meanwhile, the 200-room Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo, part of Hilton's Curio Collection, emerged in February on 13 acres of a former pineapple plantation. Notable among its offerings: day-trip excursions to Key West or Dry Tortugas National Park, with transport aboard a -- you guessed it -- seaplane.\", 'source': {'uri': 'nypost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'New York Post'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'andrew_sessa@nypost.com', 'name': 'Andrew Sessa', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/17a.seaplanes.main_.c.ta_rr.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.03529411764705881, 'wgt': 5}\n",

News flash: It\\'s not always.\\n\\nA new survey reveals that Americans are prone to lie about just about every aspect of their vacation, according to the Los Angeles Times. The travel website JetCost surveyed 4,000 Americans, and found that vacation-goers will lie about where they went, how much fancy sightseeing they did, what the weather was like, how much they drank, and where they stayed. And a whole bunch of vacation-goers lie about whether they had any fun at all (per the LA Times):\\n\\n[...] almost 70% said they had a better time on vacation than they actually did, and more than half said they wouldn\\'t tell anyone if their vacation was a complete fiasco even if it was.\\n\\nThe societal expectation to have the time of your life on vacation, no matter where you go, is unparalleled. The LA Times does not say how JetCost defines \"American\" for the purposes of the survey, but I think that, in the U.S., people need their peers to have an ah-MAZE-ing time on vacation, so that they can build it up as this life-changing experience in their minds and justify it to themselves the next time they want to take off. Think about it: The first thing that someone asks when you get back from vacation was \"HOW WAS IT?\" or sometimes, \"Did you have THE BEST time?\" Once, I asked a roommate this question, who had just gotten back from a month in Brazil to watch her sister play in the Olympics. (Sounds amazing to me!!) And my roommate, rightfully so, was like, \"I hate that question.\" My roommate was Australian, so maybe she was onto something.\\n\\nThere\\'s too much pressure to have an out-of-your-mind, bonkers good time on vacation -- but vacation can be good, fine, or even mediocre. Vacation involves some of the most painful experiences life can offer: layovers; checking bags; being on airplanes; interacting with immigration and customs official; bad seafood; long lines; sunburns; finding a small animal in your rental car. Listen: you don\\'t need to wow anyone else with your time off. The real point of vacation is not working. If you can step away and take a real break from working, you should count that as a victory against this capitalist hellscape. No need to dress it up or justify it to anyone else: Take your vacation, because no one can do it for you, and dare to go out there and have an absolutely just-fine time.', 'source': {'uri': 'jezebel.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Jezebel'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'frida_garza@jezebel.com', 'name': 'Frida Garza', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dTWo4srm--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/iqe589onzpw4iklm6ds6.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'wgt': 5}\n",

She cuts through some wired fencing and creates a heart with it instead; the following morning the foreman says the cameras caught her doing it and he wants to know if he should call the cops, her parents or her principal?\\n\\nAnother woman arrives at the Veteran\\'s Hospital where Nick (Warren Christie) talks to his nurse, revealing his heart has been broken years ago; he thanks Janet for everything as he continues his rehab.\\n\\nA couple is getting busy in the shower when he rudely ignores her as his phone goes off. Sarah (Michaela Mcmanus) walks into the patients\\' room and demands that Enzo (Dominic Chianese) and Bernie demand they give up their stash after Luis almost drowned in a pudding cup that morning from begins so high. Sarah tells them to wake up their patient, but Enzo informs her that the other patient isn\\'t asleep and has been dead for a while; she comforts Enzo. Sarah gets a call and immediately leaves to deal with things, promising to be back.\\n\\nGabe (Daren Kagasoff) wants to know why the pharmacy won\\'t prescribe cough medicine when she reveals Enzo is selling it. She asks Gabe to go easy on him as Bernie just died. She just found out and told him not to give him medication. Gabe takes Pops to a cafe, not wanting to talk about Bernie dying but he can\\'t sell drugs to old people. Gabe sits with his dad saying he doesn\\'t want to live with there anymore; but rather live with his son. Gabe reminds him that he forgets the thing and it is safer for him to be there.\\n\\nNick arrives at the apartment building where he greets Ron (Frankie Faison), who is the superintendent. Nick insists that his arms still work but kind of shocked that it is a walk-up building. Nick is subletting Tim and Philippe\\'s apartment, but they are refusing rent from him after Tim lost a brother in Iraq. He thanks Nick for his service, but he feels like it sounds all too often like people ordering a latte. Nick says it was a bomb dog that saved him, knowing he was injured but stayed with him until he was rescued. Ron offers to give him a tour of the neighborhood and this is the first day of the rest of his life.\\n\\nSarah finds her daughter, Katie (Grace Van Dien) demanding to know what is going on with her life. She says they are building corporate offices and she simply crocheted a heart for the fence. Sarah wants to know what her problem is but suddenly she vomits inside her bag; shocking Sarah who is furious that Katie is pregnant. Katie throws it in her mom\\'s face, that she did the exact same thing. Sarah says her wish 3 is a \"do over\\' with Katie, holding her tight and telling her that things will be okay.\\n\\nAn NYPD Officer, Ben (Jerod Haynes) stops outside his building, saying it is obviously a mistake that Ava (Moran Atias) is not there illegally; but Ben informs her they have a warrant and ICE needs to take her. Ben promises to take her sick son, Sami (Ethan Maher). She hugs her son tightly, swearing she will clean up this mistake. She asks Ben to call Patricia (Lorraine Toussaint), who says she will get down to immigration as soon as possible. Meanwhile, she is in a doctor\\'s appointment, hoping for good news.\\n\\nSarah isn\\'t trying to slut shame her daughter, who admit she likes the boy but isn\\'t sure if he likes her. Katie doesn\\'t want to talk about abortion in a nursing home but Sarah says it was impossibly hard having her at a young age, but she doesn\\'t regret her for a moment. When her boss tries to talk to her, Sarah runs to the bathroom and screams.\\n\\nPatricia comes to see Ava, revealing that her papers are forged. She says it was her husband who filled them out, as she couldn\\'t speak English. She orders Ava to tell her that she is going to fight this too and to think about Sami; making her repeat it again. Patricia says this program is for catching defenseless women but they have no idea they just captured a tiger!\\n\\nThe seniors are busy dancing to the hip-hop on the TV, entertaining everyone in the room. Meanwhile, Ron brings Nick down to a private bar that is in the basement, he talks about how the room was filled with smoke and poetry. The three other men join Ron, as Enzo explains they escaped the house; Enzo introduces them to his new barkeep Nick. All 3 elderly men, salute him, introducing themselves as former military and he is honored to meet them as well.\\n\\nSarah is interrupted in the closet, as another patient tells her that her time is up since this closet is the only one without a smoke detector. Sarah won\\'t let Velma smoke it, so Sarah reveals that Katie blames herself for Sarah\\'s unhappiness. She tells Sarah that Bernie\\'s grandson is there packing his belongings and if she was 34 again, she would be jumping his bones; suggesting she invite him for coffee so Katie would feel less blame on her shoulders.\\n\\nBen sits with Sami, who isn\\'t really talking at all. Ben takes the call, giving Sami the opportunity to escape from the cafe. Patricia talks with Gabe, saying Ava is their neighbor and they need to help her. He reveals that his Pops stole his credit card and he will do whatever he can.\\n\\nSarah meets John (Will Chase), who wishes he knew his father better, although the movies are a good indicator that he liked the mafia. John admits he just moved to the city in hopes of reconnecting with his dad, but Sarah can\\'t help but notice that he smells like baked goods. He reveals he is a pastry chef; he jokes that she probably smells great but admits her daughter vomited in her purse that morning. She excuses herself before she makes any more silly comments. She returns asking John out, only if he is saying yes as she can\\'t handle rejection. He agrees.\\n\\nBack at the bar, Gabe finds Enzo accusing him of stealing his credit card when he went out and bought him coffee. He says he is calling the home, demanding the card; but Enzo says him and Bernie were planning on going on a trip. Ron says they are closing but the good news is they open the rooftop every third Thursday, but he is making a special occasion tonight. Nick hands Enzo his card, saying he needs to take that trip first with Bernie.\\n\\nSarah walks by what Katie made, and tells Patricia that they both may need her; promising to see her on the roof later. Sarah enjoys the crocheted heart her daughter made as Katie looks through pregnancy information on her tablet. She meets a little girl, who calls Katie \"mom\" which she finds a touching and confusing moment.\\n\\nEnzo goes to the docks, asking if they will open the gate, so they have shared some memories of when they worked there together. Ben finds Sami hiding under some of the playground equipment in the park, joining him and holding him. Nick learns all the interesting things from Rob about what happens on the roof. Ron excuses himself as he sees Patricia approaching. He says this is his roof and all he wants to do right now is a dance with his lady, 32 years of dancing with the same woman and he knows something is wrong. She says it has just been a hard day, talking about Ava. Nick witnesses the beautiful moment, but when a lightbulb bursts, his PTSD causes him to get upset.\\n\\nThe days go by as the elderly gentlemen, enjoy all the rides in the park; thoroughly remembering their time together with Bernie.\\n\\nGabe tells Ava that the best case scenario is that she pays a fine and stays but if she is deported, Sami can stay there because he was born there. She refuses to allow him to return to Iran, revealing that she was born in a place where she wasn\\'t safe, so she traveled 6,000 miles to make sure she had a voice and now he needs to care enough to find his own voice.\\n\\nPatricia talks to Ben, who feels like he let down everyone. She says heroes are overrated and it takes a real make to stick around and deals with the carnage. Sarah arrives with John, smiling at Nick. Patricia makes a call to the cancer treatment center, saying she will take the appointment. Ron welcomes Nick to the building, hoping Nick will find new purpose living there. John thanks Nick for his service but excuses himself when a delivery arrives.\\n\\nJohn asks Sarah if he is going to meet her daughter there, even calling her pretty. She wants to know about his new chapter, wondering how long he has been divorced. He says long enough to know she wasn\\'t the one and would like to believe in things. Enzo finds Gabe working on his computer, who apologizes for being angry and worrying. Enzo feels drugs are wasted on the young and since he couldn\\'t find a peace pipe he offers him tequila. They share stories, especially how Enzo met all his friends at an amusement park.\\n\\nNick is thrilled at the arrival of his service dog; something Katie sees. She calls him the new \"soldier guy\" and he realizes she is Sarah\\'s daughter. She says she has a lot of issues with war, just like him. He rises to his feet, introducing himself as Nick Porter and his dog, Jedi. He smiles as he signs for his service dog and walks towards the building.\\n\\nPatricia talks to Katie, suggesting she could have used a picket sign for the protest, but when she mentions the crocheting, Patricia says she is her kind of girl. Sarah and Patricia talk about Ava, feeling they can all pitch in to help take care of Sami. Patricia tells Sarah that whatever Katie decides, she had one thing Sarah didn\\'t - her as a mother! Sarah joins Katie on the bench, who says if the guy is not a serial killer, he is kind of cute. She sits with Katie, holding her saying that hard and happy aren\\'t mutually exclusive and her life has been. She likes her work and Katie is worth it; she made these choices, not Katie. Katie admits she is really scared as Sarah promises she\\'s got her!\\n\\nNick has his leg removed and Nick opens the door when it is Sarah at the door. He says it\\'s not a bad time, he just prefers pants. Nick says he met Katie and she has got Sarah\\'s eyes. Sarah asks if he told her that he is Katie\\'s dad and he felt it wasn\\'t the time. They discussed telling her right away but felt they could wait until it is best to reveal it. He says he will be the legless guy upstairs. Sarah welcomes Nicky home.\\n\\nAva finds her bed in the ICE location where she is informed about her appointment in the morning with her lawyer. Ava is shocked as she didn\\'t know she has a lawyer.

A similar bill is pending in the state Senate.\\n\\nThe bill would force local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal authorities who enforce immigration laws for people who are arrested or detained, mainly U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE.\\n\\nThe House sponsor, Republican Rep. Cord Byrd of Jacksonville Beach, said the intent is to prohibit \"sanctuary policies\" that some local agencies use to protect illegal immigrants from federal authorities. Florida does not currently have any \"sanctuary cities\" that exist in other states. The bill also would require local authorities to honor immigration detainer requests from ICE or other federal agencies that can lead to a person\\'s deportation after an arrest.\\n\\n\"If you find yourself in custody, federal immigration authorities will be contacted and at that time a determination will be made about whether federal immigration authorities have further interest in you,\" Byrd said. \"We are trying to get people who are potentially dangerous in our communities out of our communities.\"\\n\\nIn addition to mandating cooperation with federal authorities, the bill would permit local officials who allow sanctuary city policies to be suspended or removed from office, and permit fines up to $5,000 a day for violations.\\n\\nSimilar legislation passed the House last year, but the Senate version did not get a floor vote. This year the measure appears to have enough momentum for final passage in both chambers.\\n\\nThe bill has prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to warn immigrants against traveling to Florida and triggered protests around the state, including one Tuesday at the Capitol. Several dozen people carried signs such as \"No Human Being Is Illegal\" and \"Undocumented, Unafraid\" followed by chants of \"No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.\"\\n\\n\"This bill will increase deportations across the board,\" said Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Winter Park Democrat. \"We can\\'t be the judge and jury in one fell swoop and say that person must leave.\"\\n\\nByrd, however, said the bill\\'s intent is not to force local law enforcement agencies to adopt federal immigration powers or conduct dragnets to catch undocumented immigrants.\\n\\n\"No one is requiring law enforcement officers to go out and ask people for their papers,\" Byrd said.\\n\\n-- -- -- -- --\\n\\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt', 'source': {'uri': 'abcnews.go.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@abcnews.go.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_ad958670d7ee4e9f8ce48500630d50ee_16x9_992.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.1607843137254902, 'wgt': 4}\n",

Amazon declined to say when the change would happen.\\n\\nThere is no federal law that requires stores to accept cash, so lawmakers are working on the issue at the state and city level.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Philadelphia became the first city to ban cashless stores, despite efforts by Amazon to dissuade it. New Jersey passed a statewide ban soon after, and a similar ban is working its way through the New York City Council. Before this year there was only one jurisdiction that required businesses to accept cash: Massachusetts, which passed a law nearly 40 years ago.\\n\\n\"The potential societal cost of a cashless economy I think outweighs the potential benefits for businesses,\" said Ritchie Torres, a New York City councilman for the South Bronx who introduced the bill.\\n\\nPolicymakers argue that while cashless enterprises aren\\'t widespread now, the practice could expand to more services, including some that cater to lower-income people.\\n\\nWalmart-owned Sam\\'s Club opened its first cashier-less store in Dallas last year, using technology that allows customers to scan and pay for items with their smartphones. Kroger has installed similar technology in about 400 stores nationwide.\\n\\nStadiums in Tampa Bay, Florida, and Atlanta have started to go cashless, or nearly cashless, and the Barclays Center, where the Brooklyn Nets play, is now effectively cashless as well.\\n\\nAdvocates for cashless bans worry technology is moving too fast for the 6.5% of American households -- 8.4 million -- who do not have a bank account, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\\n\\nFigueroa is among the much larger group considered \"underbanked,\" meaning they have a primary bank account but regularly rely on alternative financial services like check cashers. More than 24 million U.S. households are underbanked, according to the FDIC.\\n\\nThe issue disproportionately affects African-American and Hispanic communities. About 17% of African-American and 14% of Hispanic households have no bank accounts, compared to just 3% percent of white households, according to the FDIC.\\n\\nFigueroa, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, only opened a credit union account two years ago. It took another year to build up enough funds to use his debit card regularly.\\n\\nHe still occasionally relies on a check casher if he needs money quickly, and much of his income comes in cash from his weekend job as a busboy. He has no credit card and no apps on his phone and has only shopped online three times.\\n\\nBusiness owners who go cashless say they are following the lead of the majority of customers who are abandoning cash payments. Retailers are under pressure to cater to customers with heightened expectations for fast and seamless service, driven by companies like Amazon, Uber and Grubhub.\\n\\nLeo Kremer, co-owner of Dos Toros, said the volume of cash transactions at his stores fell from about 50% a decade ago to 15% last year. That made the cost and logistics of handling cash especially onerous. Before going cashless, Dos Toros locations were robbed twice.\\n\\nStill, Kremer said the company would adjust if legally required to accept cash.\\n\\n\"There are no bad guys on this issue. Everyone is trying to do the right thing and make sure there are no unintended consequences,\" he said.\\n\\nCritics say banning cash-free stores is an over-reaction.\\n\\nThere are no overall estimates on how many U.S. stores have gone cashless, but it remains a rarity. In New York City, the trend appears to be gaining traction mostly with \"fast casual\" dining establishments like Dos Toros. Far more common are stores that require a minimum purchase for non-cash payments.\\n\\n\"To call this a trend is a bit of an exaggeration,\" said J. Craig Shearman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation in Washington. \"It\\'s not something the average customer would expect to see at every store at the mall any time soon.\"\\n\\nIn testimony to a New York City Council committee, Kremer argued that businesses that \"consistently serve the unbanked and underbanked population aren\\'t going to go cashless. It wouldn\\'t make sense for them.\"\\n\\nBut financial experts who work with low-income people caution against making assumptions about the shopping preferences or buying power of those who rely on cash.\\n\\n\"I\\'m uncomfortable with the idea that certain people don\\'t shop here so it\\'s fine to exclude them,\" said Justine Zinkin, CEO of Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, a financial counseling nonprofit affiliated with the credit union where Figueroa banks.\\n\\nAP Retail Writer Joe Pisani contributed to this report from New York.', 'source': {'uri': 'abcnews.go.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'alexandra_olson@abcnews.go.com', 'name': 'Alexandra Olson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_0711b84c292b4e37a25c3cb456903874_16x9_992.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.01960784313725483, 'wgt': 4}\n",

Here are a few of my observations from the trip.\\n\\nWelcome, Travelers!\\n\\nDelhi's International Arrival Terminal T3 looks like any modern airport. Walking to the baggage claim area, travelers navigate through moving sidewalks, fancy lounges, and plenty of battery-operated vehicles. For a moment, it appeared I arrived somewhere in the West, only to be reassured that I was in India by the giant, gracious silver statues of mudras1 posing at the immigration counter.\\n\\nBaggage Claim And Ground Transportation\\n\\nDelhi has a state-of-the-art subway system that ensured a smooth ride to my hotel, helping me also save few bucks by avoiding an expensive cab ride.\\n\\nTrains are electronically tracked at every station. They have superb connectivity to Delhi and its neighboring cities/suburbs. As in New York (or in any big city in the U.S.), the subway system connects the airport to the railway station smoothly. You can even check luggage right at the railway station for a flight from the airport.\\n\\nGurgaon - a satellite town of Delhi with a big presence by more than 250 Fortune 500 companies - even has an interoffice subway that connects to the Delhi subway. It runs from building to building. Shorter commute times may enhance productivity.\\n\\nDomestic Connections And Tier 2 Cities\\n\\nEven the airports at smaller cities (Prayagraj, Varanasi, etc.) are now much better run than before. Just a few years ago, these airports were tiny, and what used to be a two-room building is now a major complex. As you move into these cities, you may find multilane roads with stretches of up to six lanes occasionally cutting right through the city. Serpentine overpasses are everywhere, with subway lines running in the background. A few years back, I didn't see even half of these overpasses. The speed at which the country built them is amazing.\\n\\nEverywhere you go in the Delhi region, you'll not just find small bazaars but also enormous shopping malls filled with showrooms of luxurious Italian and French brands. Gurugram alone has 26 large malls, one of which houses a full kilometer of shopping length on each floor. While global brands have always been in India's bigger cities, now the smaller towns are having their turn, whether the brands are fashion names like Prada and Gucci or food chains like Subway and Pizza Hut and their online food delivery apps. I was never away from the brand names I see in New York City.\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nBeyond these on-the-ground observations, let's also highlight changes that have taken place in India's economy over the last few years.\\n\\nWhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi got a clean and decisive mandate in 2014, there was a structural shift in the way India voted. Unlike as in previous governments, this was the first time in three decades that a single political party got a clean mandate in India's typically fractured, fragmented and coalition-based political system. So, expectations were sky-high, and the Modi government did not disappoint. What India has achieved in the last few years is truly staggering.\\n\\nThough there were thousands of reforms implemented in the last five years, I will highlight the most fundamental changes.\\n\\nFinancial Changes: Simplifying and unifying India's complicated taxes under the Goods & Services Tax (GST). This subsumed over 17 tax line items on every purchase to just one national tax. It made the country a true unified economic zone. Implementing the bankruptcy code to expedite liquidation and recovery of nonperforming loans. Stimulating microlending, as employment in the unorganized sector accounts for nearly 86% of total employment, through a government-backed microlending agency. Giving incentives to savers to deposit money in banks by providing free life insurance, bringing financial inclusivity to every individual in the country. Socioeconomic Changes: Implementing biometric-based unique identification (including retina scans and fingerprints), called Adhaar, for the country's 1.3 billion people. Connecting biometric identification to bank accounts and mobile phones, creating a trinity of banking, identification and connectivity. This makes India a data gold mine in incubation, and also cuts middlemen thereby stopping leakages in government welfare schemes. Employment Generation: Setting up various economic zones and government-backed semiprivate setups to encourage manufacturing and education. Giving large tax benefits to start-ups and smaller shops that employ fewer than 100 people. Infrastructural Focus: Building an average 17 miles of roads every day in India over the last five years. Achieving 100% electrification to its last villages/hamlets over the last five years.\\n\\nI can go on and on about reforms/structural changes, but that would require a book! I hope this has given you some idea of the scale at which growth is happening in that part of the world.\\n\\nFrom its #142 rank on the World Bank's ease-of-doing-business list in 2013, India is now #77 out of the 190 countries tracked by the bank.\\n\\nNo country had ever jumped 30 spots, but when India did that in 2017 alone (from 130 in 2016 to 100 in 2017), many investors started taking this country more seriously.\\n\\n1Mudras poses are a symbolic hand gesture used in Hindu and Buddhist ceremonies and statuary, and in Indian dance.\\n\\nGaurav Sinha, Associate Director, Asset Allocation and Modern Alpha\\n\\nGaurav Sinha is currently working as Asset Allocation Strategist at WisdomTree since November 2014.

Having arrived from the Philippines when she was 2, she rehearsed a Boston accent and prayed for a metamorphosis, pleading with God to turn her into a white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. But her transformation one morning at the age of 8 turned out to be less Barbie and more Kafka: \"My lips had disappeared into a mass of swollen flesh, my earlobes were triple their usual size and my cheeks were throbbing hot.\"\\n\\nIn \"The Body Papers,\" Talusan\\'s precise, delicately constructed memoir-in-essays, her brief turn as a \"puffy pink monster,\" inflamed with hives, was a sign that something monstrous was being done to her. Her father\\'s father, Tatang (Tagalog for \"father\" -- Talusan uses the Filipino vocabulary for kinship ties throughout), would arrive from the Philippines for an extended visit every spring and enter Grace\\'s room at night, pulling her floral nightgown over her shoulders. The sexual abuse started when she was 7 and ended when she was 13, after she waited for Tatang one evening and shoved him into the bedroom wall. Seeing the look of humiliation on his face, she knew that one form of torment was over: \"My rage turned to joy.\"\\n\\n\"The Body Papers\" doesn\\'t track a one-way march to triumph from adversity; Talusan\\'s essays loop in on themselves, as she retrieves old memories and finds unexpected points of connection. It was only a few years after the abuse stopped that she told her family about it. They were supportive but not surprised. Her grandfather, she learned, \"was an unrelenting pedophile.\" Her parents were compulsively secretive, having fled an authoritarian country where \"a story could get you killed.\" After her father\\'s student visa expired, the Talusans became undocumented immigrants; Grace and her older sister only found out about their vulnerable status when they had to miss school for the blood tests and fingerprinting that were part of the immigration application process.\\n\\n\"There is no paper trail to document what happened to my body,\" Talusan writes, recalling what her grandfather did to her. But once an order for her deportation arrived, a paper trail controlled her fate. She later obtained her immigration file through a Freedom of Information Act request and reproduces some of the pages in this book, as if entering them into the public record. \"With a shuffle of papers,\" she writes, \"life as I knew it could be lost.\"\\n\\nTalusan is now an American citizen, though soon after President Trump\\'s inauguration she started carrying her American passport with her whenever she left the house. Documents had once posed a threat; now they were a form of protection. When she took a genetic test at the age of 33, the slip of paper showing the results saved her life. Learning that she was genetically predisposed to the cancers that had killed a number of her female relatives, Talusan decided to have her breasts and ovaries removed.\\n\\nThese were radical interventions for a body that had suffered from years of neglect. \"I once drew a picture of myself in which my head floats over my body like a balloon,\" she writes. \"That\\'s where I really live, my head; my body is just the vehicle.\" She put on weight, trying to erect a protective barrier around herself. But the boundary between her and the world had a way of warping and dissolving.\\n\\nTalusan describes such experiences with unadorned prose that conveys a startling specificity. As an anxious child, she would bite her nails \"and line up the white slivers in the groove of the pencil holder, pretending my nails were sails for boats that would take me away.\" After her double mastectomy, she imagined what would happen if she went jogging and her silicone implants burst out of her skin: \"I saw myself stooping to collect the slippery implants, and quickly dusting off the black pebbles from the track before anyone saw.\"\\n\\nHer father, an ophthalmologist, was so preoccupied with external dangers to his loved ones\\' eyesight (Grace learned to respect \"the raw power of drinking straws, metal clothes hangers, baseballs, pencils and tree branches\") that he missed the signs that a young granddaughter, Grace\\'s niece, was developing a retinoblastoma -- a cancer of the eye. His misplaced vigilance was also what led him to miss the signs that his own daughter was being abused inside the family home.\\n\\n\"Our house was American on the outside, but Filipino on the inside,\" Talusan recalls. It was supposed to be a haven; a place where she could remove the mask that she had worn all day, as one of the few girls of color in her school. Decades later, when she temporarily moved with her husband to the Philippines for a fellowship, she wondered if returning to the land of her birth, a place where she could blend into the crowd, would alleviate the sense of loss that seemed to follow her wherever she went.\\n\\nBut even though she lived in a cosseted part of Manila, in a neighborhood with a Starbucks and a Lamborghini dealership, she knew that the poor were hauling garbage and scrounging for food on the other side of the wall. Visiting an orphanage, she met a teenage girl who had been found in a cemetery, having survived for years on the oranges and pastries that mourners left on the gravestones, in honor of the dead. \"Every day here,\" Talusan writes, \"I am offended.\"\\n\\nSuch commentary, while righteous and earned, is not the point of this indelible book.

Currently running for president of the United States as a Democratic candidate.\\n\\nAge: 40.\\n\\nFamily: Moulton is married to Elizabeth Boardman, an executive search consultant for a consulting firm. Together they have a daughter, named Emmy.\\n\\nHometown: Marblehead, Massachusetts.\\n\\nPolitical party: Democratic.\\n\\nPrevious jobs: US Marine from 2002 to 2008, managing director of Texas Central Railway, startup entrepreneur.\\n\\nLees ook op Business Insider Hoe Duncan Laurence op het Songfestival de mierzoete wraak van Ilse DeLange op Waylon kan zijn Who is Seth Moulton\\'s direct competition for the nomination?\\n\\nBased on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Moulton\\'s lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.\\n\\nEven after weeks of polling, we\\'re really not near the sample size of Seth Moulton\\'s name recognition where we\\'d be confident interpreting his performance and drawing conclusions about a viable candidacy.\\n\\nINSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate\\'s constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\\n\\nRead more about how we\\'re polling this here.\\n\\nWhat are Seth Moulton\\'s policy positions? On healthcare: Moulton supports a public option for healthcare. \"Healthcare is a right, not a privilege,\" Moulton says on his website. \"All Americans deserve health insurance that\\'s affordable, that isn\\'t tied to a job, and that covers all pre-existing conditions-no matter who you are.\" On immigration: Moulton, a centrist Democrat, describes the current immigration system as \"broken\" and supports comprehensive immigration reform that includes citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. After President Donald Trump announced his administration was ending the DACA program in 2017, Moulton rebuked the decision and described it as \"cruel and unusual, and clearly motivated purely by anti-immigrant political pandering.\" On climate change: Moulton describes climate change as one of two \"primary challenges in this country right now\" and co-sponsored the Green New Deal. \"The first [primary challenge] is that our economy is changing faster than ever before, and Americans everywhere are being left behind,\" Moulton\\'s campaign website said. \"The second is climate change. That\\'s why we need a Green New Deal: because if we do it right, we can solve both problems at once.\" Moulton opposes Trump\\'s changes to legislation on climate change: \"President Trump\\'s executive order on the environment shows a complete disregard for facts and science. Trump\\'s executive order completely ignores reality and will irresponsibly roll back the progress we made under President Obama to protect our environment for generations to come.\" In 2016, Moulton signed a resolution that called for 50% of US energy production to originate from clean and carbon-free sources by 2030. On campaign finance: According to OpenSecrets, 15% of Moulton\\'s PAC donations during his career have come from labor, while 66% have come from businesses. Moulton raised millions of dollars through the Serve America PAC, his veteran-boosting political action committee. Between January 2017 and September 2018, the PAC raised $2 million and was the third-highest Democratic leadership fundraiser, according to POLITICO. On abortion: Moulton supports abortion rights. He voted against imposing penalties for abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. \"Restricting women\\'s rights is not just bad for women, it\\'s bad for families, it\\'s bad for communities, and it\\'s bad for a country founded upon the values of freedom and equal rights,\" Moulton said in a statement in 2018. On LGBTQ rights: Moulton backed the Equality Act, an amendment to the Civil Rights Act. The Equality Act seeks to ban discrimination against LGBT people in many facets of society, including housing, federal funding, employment, and education. \"No one should ever be discriminated against because of whom they love,\" Moulton said in a statement. \"That\\'s not who we are as Americans. Every American deserves the same basic protections under the law.\" On education: Moulton hails progressive education reforms but raises awareness to some of its shortcomings. \"Despite the many successes that have resulted from [the Every Student Succeeds Act], and No Child Left Behind, too often a child\\'s zip code determines the quality of his or her educational opportunities,\" Moulton said in a statement. \"This is wrong, and we can do better.\" Moulton describes the skyrocketing cost of college education as \"unacceptable\" and co-authored legislation to provide free community college to students. On guns: Moulton, a former infantry officer in the Marine Corps, is not shy about voicing his support for gun control. \"We are losing too many Americans to hate and gun violence, and I believe Congress has a moral obligation to take meaningful steps to heal our country and prevent these tragedies,\" Moulton said in a statement. \"We owe it to the victims of these senseless tragedies and their families to debate and vote on reasonable gun violence prevention proposals which the majority of Americans support.\" Moulton supports an assault rifle ban and mandatory background checks for all firearm purchases. Following the 2017 shooting in Las Vegas, Moulton supported the ban on bump stocks. He holds an \"F\" rating from the NRA. On criminal justice reform: Moulton disagrees with the notion that marijuana is a gateway drug and supports legalization. \"Regulation is the way to address the concerns around these issues and actually try to make it safe,\" Moulton said in 2016. \"But that\\'s not going to happen if it\\'s simply illegal.\" Moulton encouraged Veterans Affairs (VA) doctors to be open about considering marijuana as a possible treatment for patients. He does not believe prison inmates should have the right to vote but adds that they should \"absolutely\" have their rights restored after serving their sentences. On trade: Moulton broadly agrees with levying certain tariffs but characterizes Trump\\'s approach as \"short-sighted, irresponsible, and dangerous.\" Moulton describes China as one of the US\\'s \"economic competitors\" who \"steals our intellectual property.\" Instead of sparking a trade war with China, Moulton calls for it to be held accountable by the World Trade Organization. He believes tariffs on steel and aluminium will hurt US jobs. On foreign policy: Moulton believes Asia should establish a NATO-like entity to counter China. Russia is the immediate threat to the US while China is the long-term problem, according to Moulton. Moulton proposed redistributing the defense budget away from costly systems, such as aircraft carriers, and into the newer projects, like cyber weaponry. He has called for repealing the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which broadly allows the president to use military assets against groups directly and indirectly associated with the 9/11 attacks. Moulton disagreed with the merits of the Iraq War and pushed for the US to develop a coherent and sustainable plan for future operations in the Middle East. On taxes: Moulton cosponsored a resolution to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $12.00 an hour by 2020. In 2017, he voted against the Republican tax bill and called it \"economically dangerous.\" Moulton supports comprehensive tax reform that benefits middle class Americans. \"This isn\\'t a tax reform plan, this is just a tax cut for the wealthy,\" Moulton said in a statement. \"And Republicans are shoving it down our throats.\" He backed a bill that would require Trump to release 10 years of tax returns. What are Seth Moulton\\'s political successes and failures? Moulton\\'s demand for \"a new generation of leaders\" to serve in Congress paid off in the 2018 midterm elections. His PAC endorsed candidates who had military or intelligence agency backgrounds, and flipped House seats in numerous states. He spearheaded a movement to prevent Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California from becoming Speaker. The effort eventually fizzled. How much money has Seth Moulton raised?\\n\\nMoulton announced his candidacy in late April and raised $255,000 in the first quarter. The roughly $723,000 in his House campaign account can be used for his presidential campaign.\\n\\nCould Seth Moulton beat President Trump?\\n\\nReferring back to INSIDER\\'s recurring poll, Seth Moulton is not getting anywhere near enough name recognition to get the needed sample size to draw conclusions about how he\\'d perform in a general election against Donald Trump. Generally, that is not a good sign.\\n\\nRead more of our best stories on Seth Moulton: Massachusetts Rep.

And like the subject of the Iggy Pop song bearing that title, he rides and he rides -- buses, cabs, ferries, trains, planes.\\n\\nThe Passenger is not a mere commuter, either: His trips cover multiple lands over several continents; one involves leaving the physical realm (cue ayahuasca and a shaman).\\n\\nSpanning 28 years, the events Mr. Phillips recounts in \"17 Border Crossings\" are mostly drawn from his own experiences. We are lucky this theatermaker is so well-traveled, otherwise we might have been stuck with accounts of a junior year in Paris. Instead, we visit Colombia, Croatia and Cuba.\\n\\nAnd those are just the countries starting with C.\\n\\nThey are all summoned thanks to the inventive use of basic theatrical tools, as David Todaro\\'s lighting and Robert Kaplowitz\\'s sound help create different settings on a stage bare except for a desk, a chair and a hanging light bar that can be pulled up and down.\\n\\nMr. Phillips, whose earlier works include \"Capsule 33\" and \"Red-Eye to Havre de Grace,\" is an ingratiating writer and performer. He needs little by way of props to evoke a trip on a ferry crossing the Mediterranean, riding shotgun on a Colombian motorcycle taxi or trying to sleep in a cramped compartment on a Balkan Express train. He also eases in and out of different languages, peppering the script with Spanish, Portuguese, Czech and French, among others.\\n\\nThroughout, the staging by Tatiana Mallarino (Mr. Phillips\\'s wife) moves with a fluidity at odds with the travel mishaps, which are related with dry humor. A recurring gag involves Ace of Base\\'s \"All That She Wants,\" the Europop hit that had no problem ignoring custom checkpoints to spread with the ineluctable ease of a virus back in 1992.\\n\\nThen again, the stamps in the Passenger\\'s passport have a more lasting presence than his anecdotes, because the genial, light-footed show retreats every time things get sticky or uncomfortable. And when borders come up nowadays, unsettling matters are hard to avoid. Flying into Liberty International Airport in Newark from Bogotá, the Passenger is detained five hours by Homeland Security for unclear reasons. Not much is made of it.\\n\\nThe show -- which was added to the New York Theater Workshop season as a late replacement for Martyna Majok\\'s delayed \"Sanctuary City\" -- has been slightly revised since it was presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2015. A new story is about trying to attend a Live Aid-like concert held in February 2019 in Cúcuta, a Colombian city next to Venezuela. But over all Mr. Phillips steers clear from obvious topical references until the very end, which takes place between Mexico and the United States.\\n\\nThe Passenger tells of becoming a \"dental refugee\" when he has to get two molars removed in Ciudad Juárez because it is much cheaper than in the United States. He meets a man named Pablo who was once caught in the net of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, then goes on to imagine the point of view of an American Border Patrol agent sitting in wait by the Rio Grande, watching for people trying to cross. The oddly gentle conclusion seems to suggest that we are all parts of a cosmic whole where borders mean little. Alas, being starry-eyed seems less poetic than naïve nowadays.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'elisabeth_vincentelli@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Elisabeth Vincentelli', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/arts/15border/15boarder-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1686274509803922, 'wgt': 4}\n",

Mexican political and economic analyst Macario Schettino wrote recently for the newspaper El Financiero that unless trends change, investment could fall 5% in the first trimester and possibly remain at similar levels throughout 2019.\\n\\nAttendees said implementing the USMCA, which must still be voted on by lawmakers in all three countries, could help that.\\n\\n\"We are going to close ranks to win its ratification as soon as possible,\" Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said, adding that officials were optimistic about announcing a number of investments derived from the dialogue.\\n\\nOften historically tricky, U.S.-Mexico relations became particularly fraught following the election of Trump, who repeatedly hammered the United States\\' southern neighbor on trade, the border and migration.\\n\\n\"I congratulate the new presidential administration in Mexico for its strong emphasis on improving the economic development of this region in particular,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at the gala. \"We also thank them for assisting us as we confront the crisis at our southern border.\"\\n\\nMexico is the United States\\' second-largest export market and its third-biggest trading partner, with more than $678 billion in goods and services changing hands last year, according to Ross. U.S. foreign direct investment in Mexico was over $109 billion in 2017, he added, and Mexican investment in the United States has reached more than $35 billion.\\n\\nDonohue said the Chamber had \"vigorously\" opposed the idea of closing the U.S.-Mexico border, which would have imperiled that trade.\\n\\nBut even as Trump backed off that threat, he gave Mexico a year to stop the flow of drugs and migrants or face tariffs on cars or other products.\\n\\nTwelve months from now, the 2020 election campaign will be in full swing, and some say a candidate Trump is likely to try to keep illegal immigration front-and-center as meat for his base.\\n\\n\"When he is competing electorally or out there on the stump, he goes to a dark place, and Mexico is often in that place,\" said Shannon O\\'Neil, senior fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\n\\n\"And so whether it\\'s immigration or drugs or other security threats or Mexico\\'s effect on the economy as he perceives it, I think that will be the mainstay of his rhetoric,\" said O\\'Neil, who was not at the Merida gathering. \"And so yes, I think there\\'s a growing chance that the border will be a centerpiece of the 2020 U.S. election and not in a way that will be helpful to Mexico.\"\\n\\nBefore López Obrador took office in December, many had been concerned about possible clashes between Trump and the leftist populist who won the presidency in his third try. But so far, ties between Washington and Mexico City seem to have generally held up well, with the two administrations working closely on a number of bilateral issues and López Obrador officials reluctant to react to critical tweets from Trump.\\n\\nMexican officials said in Merida that from the earliest days, López Obrador\\'s administration has looked to private sector leaders in both countries, executives with deep and longstanding cross-border ties, for cues on navigating what they expected to be a trying relationship.\\n\\n\"These are businesspeople, and they\\'re used to climates changing and they\\'re used to looking out a few years beyond the present,\" said Garza, the former ambassador. \"And they\\'re used to having to work very hard to get things done in environments that are, you know, where there\\'s not a tailwind every day.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'abcnews.go.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC News'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_36507b9f6af541c9a19342f70bf84879_16x9_992.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.01960784313725483, 'wgt': 3}\n",

Levi Strauss is no victim.\\n\\nWhen investors think about Levi Strauss, digital transformation is probably not top of mind. After all, the company has been making blue jeans for 145 years.\\n\\nTimes change. These days, every company is either a technology business, or the victim of one. Levi Strauss is no victim. Shares of the San Francisco clothier will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday with the ticker LEVI.\\n\\nTech investors should be ready to consider buying.\\n\\nThe company is expected to price 37 million shares at $14 to $16 on Wednesday evening. The midpoint would give the jean maker a market capitalization of $5.6 billion.\\n\\nIn 1853, a strapping Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss settled in the Bay area. He saw an opportunity to expand his family textile business to the West Coast. It was the height of the gold rush. And two decades later he would make his mark with a pair of pants tough enough to hold up to the rigors of mining. It was 1873. Blue jeans were born.\\n\\nBack then, gold mining shaped his dry goods business. Today, it's all about using technology to manage inventory, and earn a high return on invested capital.\\n\\nGiven the proposed offering price, Levi Strauss is being offered at a significant discount to its peers, according to a report from MarketWatch and my own calculations. At the midpoint of the range, they price in the worst return on invested capital during the last five years, and after-tax operating profits of just 10%. The company return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2018 was 28%, the MarketWatch report notes.\\n\\nAll of this is relevant because Levi Strauss is in the middle of a business model change. The company began diversifying away from its core business of selling blue jeans mostly to men when Chip Bergh, chief executive officer, took over in 2011. Revenues from men's products have declined from 77% in 2014, to 69% in 2018.\\n\\nToday, t-shirts, fleeces and women's clothing play a much bigger role in overall revenues. As an added benefit, these categories tend to turn over more quickly, leading to increased profitability and better cash flows.\\n\\nThe company is also making gains with its direct to consumer model. In 2018, the DTC channel represented 35% of sales, up from 29% in 2015. More importantly, items sold through this channel carry higher gross margins, turn over more frequently and create massive streams of data that can be analyzed and used to inform other parts of the business.\\n\\nThis prospect is the most exciting part of the business. In addition to waist sizes, Levi's is known for its many styles, fits and finishes. From 501s and 505s, to skinny, athletic and relaxed, the possible variants are endless. Analysts at IPO Candy note there are 467 men's jean options on the corporate website. And that does not take into account all of the different finishes and colors.\\n\\nCollecting more data will help the company refine the its product offerings, reducing inventory further.\\n\\nLevi Strauss reported that fourth quarter revenues increased 9% year over year to $1.5 billion. Fiscal 2018 sales were $5.6 billion, up 14%.\\n\\nWith most of retail has been in a deep funk, these are terrific numbers. And considering the IPO puts the valuation in the $5.6 billion range, at just 1x sales, shares look dirt cheap.\\n\\nFor comparison, American Eagle (AEO) , a broken business, trades at 1x sales. Nike (NKE) , a much healthier enterprise, trades at 3.7x sales. Levi Strauss probably should trade somewhere in between the two.\\n\\nLook for shares hit the ground running Thursday morning. Based an expected march toward 2.5x sales, shares could reach $36 in the coming year and a half.\\n\\nTo learn more about Jon Markman's recommendations at the crossroads of culture and technology, check out his daily investment newsletter Strategic Advantage.

This year, P&I also added a new category on financial wellness, recognizing 12 campaigns that sought to bolster financial literacy skills, help participants get the most out of their health savings accounts and foster engagement with the sponsor\\'s retirement plans. To produce this special report, web producer Patrick Roth and reporters Brian Croce and Margarida Correia spoke with a number of plan sponsors and service providers to learn more about the strategies driving their successful communication campaigns. Their interviews, which follow, have been edited for clarity and length.\\n\\nLaura Humphries, DENSO International America\\n\\nFirst place (tie) in financial wellness/corporate plans, more than 5,000 participants\\n\\ntell us more: \"Our campaign was for Get F.I.T. We secured buy-in from our executives and then partnered with Empower. We came up with a moniker titled Get F.I.T.\" (That stands for Get Financial Independence Tools.) \"It was a campaign of emails, hard copy, brochures and posters across the organization at two locations. The first was a corporate environment, primarily white-collar workers. The second was a plant environment. At both locations we developed advocate teams, so we pulled from different areas in the organization to get feedback about the program. They actually helped us develop the campaign.\"\\n\\nWhy now: \"We\\'re looking at our incoming population and they\\'re carrying a very high student debt load; we also surveyed across the organization and found that we\\'re carrying high proportions for loans as well as hardship distributions. The hardship distributions are primarily for mortgage defaults and people who are looking at evictions. We know that there\\'s a need across all aspects of the organization. This was an opportunity for education as well as one-on-one consultations with financial advisers, which was very valuable.\"\\n\\nFinal thoughts: \"There\\'s a plethora of information that\\'s out there in terms of financial tools -- information that\\'s available for free. But I think associates are really struggling with identifying what they need at a specific point in time. And our program really tried to target those teachable moments: when you were having children, when you were going through a divorce, when you were getting ready to retire.\" Across the board and across generations, people like to talk to other people. That one-on-one consultation is very valuable.\"\\n\\nMichelle Gawinski, The Boldt Co.\\n\\nFirst place in financial wellness/corporate plans, fewer than 1,000 participants\\n\\nTell us more: We have a wellness program and we wanted to add financial wellness to it, so we started a lunch-and-learn program called Food, Physical and Financial Fitness. We have an on-site health coach -- a registered nurse -- who gives us tips on health-care topics -- everything from food tips to exercises we can do at home. We started lunch and learns to do the financial piece. We met with Francis Investment Counsel, which had just put together a campaign to have different topics catered to the different age groups. The one that was very well attended was the one on raising financially savvy children. Even grandparents came to those.\"\\n\\nWhy now: We felt that our wellness program was missing the financial piece. We didn\\'t limit the topics to retirement. If employees wanted to talk about their student loans, or if they wanted to talk about savings for their children\\'s college, or if they wanted to talk about long-term care, they could touch on all those things, other than their 401(k) plan.\"\\n\\nFinal thoughts: One of the things we wanted them to take away was feeling confident that they have a plan to help make them more financially ready. And from the responses we had, this was overwhelmingly appreciated by our employees.\"\\n\\nBecca Jones, Cone Health\\n\\nFirst place in financial wellness/not for profit/other, more than 5,000 participants\\n\\nTell us more: \"We started a financial wellness campaign in January (2018). We have a very robust employee wellness program, so we do really well in the areas of fitness and healthy eating, smoking cessation, stress management -- things like that. But we were lacking in the area of financial wellness. We started off by surveying our employees and asking them about their financial priorities. And then we took that information and created an entire financial wellness campaign. We have a wide variety of employees. And financial wellness is different for everyone.\"\\n\\nWhy now: The absence of financial wellness \"causes a lot of stress. If employees are saving comfortably, if they are financially healthy, then they\\'re better employees. I think it\\'s part of the overall wellness package.\"\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Again, financial wellness is different for everybody and you have to offer a variety of mediums. So email, text, one-on-one counseling, onsite sessions. And you have to create a level of trust between human resources and your retirement provider and employees. We incentivized participation through our healthy rewards program so employees could earn cash by participating.\"\\n\\nJason Chepenik, Chepenik Financial\\n\\nFirst place in special projects/generic\\n\\nTell us more: We have a taco truck called \\'Let\\'s taco-bout retirement\\' that goes from client to client. For employees who sign up or increase how much they are saving in their retirement plan, they get a free taco. And if not, they get rice and beans because that\\'s all they can eat in retirement.\"\\n\\nWhy now: The investment industry is so innovative and they\\'ve done a great job with investment analytics, target-date funds\" and other components. \"I think some of the part that still creates anxiety is how do you get people into a plan? The idea of saving money or using concepts of deferral ... is overwhelming. It just brings anxiety. So if we can lower the bar and just make it easy, fun and feed them, it created this environment -- and really, a social environment because everybody is hanging out around the food truck. It made it easy to enter the plan and at an entry point that didn\\'t seem overwhelming.\"\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Simplicity. You don\\'t have to overthink things. I think the investment industry has taken care of record keeping with technology (and) investments with default investments. But the simplicity of just getting in and saving a little bit can really make a difference in (participants\\') future.\"\\n\\nJim Courtney, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board\\n\\nSecond place (tie) for special projects/public, more than 5,000 participants\\n\\nTell us more: The \"Now You Know\" series of videos \"are essentially our frequently asked questions, but in video format, written, produced and hosted by our own employees. (They are) very sharable on social media.\"\\n\\nWhy now?: \"Social media is a very important way of sharing information now, not just among young people. When you think social media, most people think millennials. But for us, our followers on Facebook, 40% of them are 55 and older; 13% of them are 65 and older. Social media is a great way for people to learn about information and then share it with their peers.\"\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Not everybody absorbs information the same way. Some people would like to read a page on a website, other people, \\'just tell me what it is.\\' So having one of our employees just tell them in a minute\\'s time what they need to know (was) a perfect way to get information.\"\\n\\nManuel Carvallo, Hispanic Wealth\\n\\nHonorable mention, ongoing investment education/generic\\n\\nTell us more: A series of videos aimed to explain, \"from very basic steps, how the immigrant community can start learning finance (such as the importance of building a credit history). When we come to the U.S., there are many things that work differently in our (home country). I thought (education) was needed and created a series of videos addressing those issues.\"\\n\\nWhy now: Because we make a lot of mistakes and mistakes here are very costly. For example, in most countries in Latin America, not being in the credit bureau is a good thing because being in the credit bureau means you have debt that you have not paid. Here, many people actively do not want to participate in the credit bureau.\" That creates \"problems (in the U.S.) because then your insurance costs you more and you can\\'t get a job, etc. But if people do not explain this to the participants, how are they going to know?\"\\n\\nFinal thoughts: For immigrants, \"don\\'t be afraid to ask. A lot of Latinos have this guilt about not knowing and it\\'s perfectly normal not to know. They need to start asking questions and engage with whoever can answer those questions. And this material is to allow these people to learn about finance.\"\\n\\nRebecca Ward, Savannah River Nuclear Solutions\\n\\nFirst place, conversions/not for profit/other, more than 5,000 employees\\n\\nTell us more: We were doing a conversion from Mercer as the record keeper to Transamerica. To get ready for that transition and to take advantage of the change, we also added a Roth to our plan, increased our auto-deferral rate from 4% to 8% and implemented auto escalation. We migrated Aug. 1, then we did a big SIP education campaign. (The plan is called the Savings and Investment Plan.) For three days we had classes, and we set up stations where people could log into Transamerica and see how to get onto the plan sponsor site and learn about getting ready to retire and all kinds of topics.\"\\n\\nWhy now: \"It was because Transamerica bought Mercer\\'s business and so really we didn\\'t have a choice. We needed to move to a new record keeper. It was going to be a lot of change so (we thought) we might as well put some new plan design changes in at the same time. It was very well received.\"\\n\\nFinal thoughts: \"People were more receptive to the increase in the auto-deferral rate. We were very concerned about that going from 4% to 8% that people might complain, (especially) new hires but we got no complaints. So that was a very nice surprise. People are being auto-enrolled so they\\'re going to be better prepared for retirement.\"\\n\\nGoogle News - Editors Picks, Special Report, Asset owners, Defined contribution plans,', 'source': {'uri': 'pionline.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pensions & Investments'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20190318/PRINT/190319898/AR/0/AR-190319898.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4667490', 'sentiment': 0.3098039215686275, 'wgt': 3}\n",

Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Obama administration did its best to sabotage the presidency of Donald Trump. They did this by issuing a flood of midnight regulations intended on distracting Republicans from implementing the Trump agenda in the first two years of Trump. One of these regulations that still remains alive targets the destruction of the EB-5 immigrant visa program that has created $1.5 billion in investment and created thousands of jobs in New York City.\\n\\nThe last-minute push by the Obama administration was undeniable. The Hill reported on January 23, 2017, about a study by the American Action Forum (AAF) that tallied up \"$40 billion worth of \\'midnight regulations.\\'\" The report indicated that \"last year [2016], federal agencies issued nearly $165 billion in final rules, according to the AAF, compared to $99 billion in 2015 and $79 billion in 2014.\" When you consider that $40 billon of the $165 billion in regulations were during the last months of the Obama administration -- with a staggering $24 billion coming in the final three weeks -- it is clear that the Obama administration was intent on disrupting the first 100 days of the incoming Trump presidency.\\n\\nSubscribe to Observer\\'s Politics Newsletter\\n\\nA handful of these regulations were massive. The American Action Forum\\'s report issued on February 2, 2017, indicated that a 2017-25 CAFE Standards rule was projected to cost $10.8 billion, Mercury Standards for Coal cost $9.6 billion and the Clean Power Plant rules cost $8.4 billion. Of the agencies responsible for the rules, the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) was the winner with $344 billion in costs. One that was little noticed was a regulation targeting merit-based investment visas that provided a magnet for investment in New York City infrastructure.\\n\\nThe Obama administration published a rule on January 13, 2017, just days before the end of Obama\\'s term, to \"amend its regulations governing the employment-based, fifth preference (EB-5) immigrant investor classification and associated regional centers to reflect statutory changes and modernize the EB-5 program,\" according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office at the Department of Homeland Security. The proposal was intended to severely limit the program and make it largely unworkable.\\n\\nA number of business groups in including the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney that made the case: \"regulations proposed during the Obama administration are currently being reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Our organizations are concerned that these rules will fall far short in achieving the reforms necessary to improve and sustain the EB-5 program over the long term. The regulations do not address the program\\'s national security and fraud concerns. Nor do they effectively balance the interests of stakeholders through the creation of a workable visa \\'set aside\\' for projects in rural and urban distressed communities.\" They argued that Congress is a better place to improve, not squash, this program with ideas intended to limit it. The Obama regulations were intended to limit, not reform, the program.\\n\\nThe Obama rules hike investment requirements and change the parameters in a way that makes it unable to work as intended. The New York City Regional Center (NYCRC) announced on March 4, 2019 that \"over the past 10 years, the NYCRC has put over $1.5 billion of EB-5 capital to work across a broad spectrum of infrastructure and real estate projects in New York City.\" These projects included \"$220 million to finance ground-up construction in the Bronx; $108.5 million to finance ground-up and redevelopment projects in Washington Heights (an Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone); and,$767 million to finance ground-up, redevelopment, and infrastructure projects in Brooklyn, including seven projects totaling $339 million in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\" If this regulation is allowed to go into effect, those projects will be the last.\\n\\nThe president has promised repeatedly to change the system to a merit-based structure. President Donald Trump said at his 2019 State of the Union address that he would work \"to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure.\" The EB-5 investment visa program falls squarely into this promised change.\\n\\nOBM Director Mick Mulvaney has always been a strong supporter of merit-based immigration policies; same with Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. Both of these Trump officials must recognize that the EB-5 program should not be allowed to be ruined by a last-minute Obama era regulation.\\n\\nBrian Darling is former Counsel and Sr. Communications Director for Sen.

It was April 1994, and violence was escalating after the death of the president, as ethnic tensions erupted. Crossing the border to seek safety in refugee camps in the neighboring Congo, the pair were eventually orphaned by the killings.\\n\\nApril 7 marks 25 years since the Rwandan genocide. Over the course of 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people were killed -- most of them members of the minority Tutsi ethnic group killed by the majority Hutu population.\\n\\nGadi and his sister\\'s new lives in Rwanda began at the end of 1994 after the genocide ended, when they returned with the Red Cross to their homeland and came to the Imbabazi Orphanage in the country\\'s north. Run by Rosamond Carr, an American humanitarian who had lived in Rwanda since 1949, the orphanage was a sanctuary for children who had lost their families as a result of that traumatic summer.\\n\\nFor Gadi, and two other boys, Mussa Uwitonze and Bizimana Jean, the orphanage also became the place where, years later, they first picked up cameras at a photography workshop run by Through the Eyes of Children, an organization founded in 2000 by photographer American David Jiranek. All three boys seized the chance to tell their own stories by taking pictures. It marked the beginning of a lifelong passion for photography.\\n\\nNow all in their late twenties, the three men are spreading that passion to other vulnerable children, taking on the leadership of Through the Eyes of Children by teaching photography workshops in Rwanda and around the world. Working initially with 19 \"camera kids,\" the photography workshops for vulnerable children in Rwanda started in 2000, teaching them the basics of lighting, composition and stop-motion among other photography techniques. The photographs made by workshop participants have been exhibited at the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda\\'s capital Kigali, the United Nations headquarters in New York and at Holocaust museums around the world. \"When you give a child a chance to tell their story from their perspective, it tells them they matter, and that their story matters,\" says Joanne McKinney, project director at Through the Eyes of Children.\\n\\nDocumenting scenes of everyday life in the country, the extraordinarily large collection of photographs track the healing and rebuilding of Rwanda in the years after the genocide. \"For us orphans, we were able to express ourselves and the world could see our photos, our country and the children of it,\" says Mussa Uwitonze, now 28 years old and the father of two girls. The photographs from the workshops did more than show life in Rwanda to international audiences. Proceeds from sales of the images to buyers around the world fed back into Imbabazi, paying for the children\\'s clothing, food and education. Many of the original Camera Kids have gone on to pursue careers in photography for media, events and non-profit organizations in Rwanda.\\n\\nAlmost 20 years on from their first workshop, and 25 years on from the genocide, Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana are embarking on their own journey, telling their story through different means. They are both the subjects and storytellers of a forthcoming documentary, entitled Camera Kids, in partnership with American filmmaker Beth Murphy, Director of Films for the Groundtruth Project, an international non-profit media organization supporting storytelling and freedom of expression in the United States and developing countries around the world.\\n\\nThe three men have all worked as professional photographers and now lead the Through the Eyes of Children photography workshops. But a few years ago, they realized they were still troubled by lingering questions about their past. \"We all had so many questions since our time at the orphanage,\" says Mussa. \"Who are these people who participated in the genocide? What were they thinking when they were killing people? We decided that it was our time, as photographers and storytellers, to find out the answers from the real people who participated in the genocide.\"\\n\\nThese are the questions that Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana seek to answer in the documentary, which follows their reunions with the other original camera kids from Imbabazi Orphanage, which closed in 2014, as well as a three month-long journey through villages across northern Rwanda, interviewing and photographing those responsible for the violence and their families. So far, they have interviewed participants in the genocide and their families, and have the goal of interviewing 100 perpetrators in total. \"We want to hear what their stories are and why they were involved,\" Gadi says, \"but I don\\'t expect to get a full or satisfactory answer. There is no valid reason that would lead one to kill another. However, talking to these perpetrators and survivors, I can see that eventually there has been some kind of reconciliation.\"\\n\\nMurphy, the filmmaker, has been filming Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana for the past three years, with plans to release a feature-length documentary in late 2020. \"Making peace with your enemy is one of the most difficult things a person can do, and the story in Rwanda can really be something to emulate,\" she tells TIME.\\n\\nMurphy also says she was struck by some of the parallels in Rwanda with the rise of hate speech back home in the United States. \"Some of the language the perpetrators use to explain why they did what they did sounds a lot like some of the language that we\\'re hearing today, especially from white nationalists in the United States.\" Leading up to the 1994 genocide, government-sanctioned propaganda and radio broadcast messages were used to dehumanize the Tutsis and stoke hatred against them. Murphy sees parallels today around the world with the use of the word \"invasion,\" a phrase used by President Donald Trump to describe the movement of Central American migrants towards the U.S. border. The term \"invaders\" was also used in the New Zealand shooter\\'s manifesto before he killed 50 people at a mosque in Christchurch last month. \"It\\'s chilling. And it is leading to violence and death,\" Murphy says. \"I want this film to be an antidote to hateful ideology and xenophobia.\"\\n\\nBeyond the perpetrator project, Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana are concentrating their efforts on expanding the mission of Through the Eyes of Children worldwide. In the U.S., they have led photography workshops with immigrant Haitian teenagers in New Jersey and foster children in Boston. In May, they plan to visit Haiti for workshops with orphanages, and will be traveling to Lebanon later in the year to share their photography craft with Syrian refugees. \"It\\'s a great feeling to be able to transfer knowledge to kids in difficult conditions like we used to be in,\" Gadi tells TIME. \"It\\'s like giving them a medicine to heal them. It\\'s treating them because we know from experience that because of photography, they will be better people.\" The men want to foster a global community of camera kids, united by telling their own stories through photography and fostering empathy with others. \"A lot of kids around the world need photography to be able to express themselves, to know lives outside their boxes,\" says Mussa.\\n\\nAnd in Rwanda, where it all started, photography remains integral to the three men\\'s lives. Gadi is pursuing a part-time career as a photographer and has worked with several non-profit organizations. Mussa recently left his job as a tour operator to become a full-time photographer, and Bizimana is in his second year as a staff photographer with Reuters Africa. Their determination to share their knowledge of photography with future generations has led to workshops with street children, disabled children, and now -- after the \\'Camera Kids\\' film project -- workshops with the children of both survivors and perpetrators of the genocide. \"When we were kids, [Rosamond Carr] used to tell us that we have to share with others what we have,\" Bizimana says, reflecting on the legacy of his late foster mother. \"This is the heritage she gave us. Giving other kids photography is doing what we promised her.\"\\n\\nCorrection, April 6: The original version of this story misstated the start date of the Rwandan genocide.

Brexit supporters regard such terms as betraying the 2016 Brexit referendum itself. These 17.4 million Britons undoubtedly believed that Brexit would mean exactly that: Britain would no longer be governed by any EU laws, regulations, etc. Nevertheless, all that the world has heard since that day in June 2016 is a debate over the terms of leaving, with any so-called terms being labeled as a \"soft Brexit\" and leaving without any agreement as a \"hard Brexit.\"\\n\\nIn a \"hard Brexit,\" Britain just leaves, and all EU regulations, etc. are null and void. It\\'s pretty clear-cut. A \"soft Brexit\" can mean almost anything that is not a \"hard Brexit\"; i.e., Britain would agree to continue some or all of the manufacturing regulations, tariffs and intergovernmental agreements - such as ceding jurisdiction to the European Court of Justice - that apply to EU countries. The list is almost endless and the time frame very nebulous, a perfect playground for those who wish to have a Brexit In Name Only. If there is to be Brexit of any sort, however, Parliament must act. Experts in British constitutional law claim that only Parliament can actually take Britain out of the EU and only Parliament can decide under what terms, if any, it will do so. Of course, one of the terms of separation could be that there are no terms of separation - thus, a \"hard Brexit.\"\\n\\nThe Effect on Effects on Imports\\n\\nThe current government has been exploring the possibility of dropping all import tariffs to zero except on \"sensitive industries.\" This would be very good for consumers, because the EU imposes tariffs on almost all imports from nations not in the EU itself. Most notably, in its attempt to insulate inefficient European farms from worldwide competition, the EU imposes onerous tariffs on non-EU agricultural products via the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Eliminating these and many other tariffs would significantly lower the cost of living for the British people. The success of Brexit may depend entirely on whether Britain does, in fact, eliminate tariffs on most goods. It is a golden opportunity. The EU itself is very export-oriented, so it is unlikely that it would impose any restrictions on member countries selling goods to Britain. So far, so good!\\n\\nThe Effect on British Exports\\n\\nExports are another matter entirely. No longer in the tariff free customs union, it is assumed that the EU would impose tariffs on British products as it does on any other non-EU country, raising their cost to EU buyers - which, one must assume, would result in fewer British sales. The real harm would not fall on British exporters but on Britain\\'s EU customers, who now are forcibly prohibited from buying British goods at the previously advantageous price. On the other hand, since it no longer must meet onerous EU manufacturing regulations, British industry might enjoy lower manufacturing costs, which would enable it to sell more to non-EU countries. Although it might take time for Britain to develop new markets for its goods, some countries, led by the U.S. itself, have stated that they are ready to sign free trade agreements with Britain as soon as it leaves the EU.\\n\\nThe Effect on the City of London\\n\\nThe City of London is a massive global hub. Its banking and insurance companies are dominant in the EU and likely to remain so for reasons of depth of market knowledge and a high reputation for honesty and fair dealing. Although some companies have moved some operations to Frankfurt, it is unclear if these moves are significant in number and may be simply part of normal market flux. The same fears about the fate of the City were raised when Britain secured an opt-out from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which formally created the euro. Unless the EU imposes some special tax or regulation prohibiting EU members from utilizing London firms, it is unlikely that the City will be much affected by a \"hard Brexit.\"\\n\\nThe Effect on Controlling borders\\n\\nUncontrolled illegal immigration into the EU became a key issue for passing the Brexit referendum. There had been much concern for decades over loss of British sovereignty to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and the economic cost of belonging to a closed customs union with high tariffs and onerous regulations, but the movement to leave came to a head over border controls or lack thereof. One of the four pillars of the EU is freedom of movement of people within the EU. (The other three were freedom of movement for goods, services, and capital.) Illegal immigration came to a head following the crisis of refugees from the Arab world. Once inside the EU, these refugees could migrate anywhere within the bloc, including Britain, raising the cost of providing social services and disrupting settled life. Britain was not the only EU country that opposed this unforeseen migration. In fact immigration control may yet break apart the EU, as the elite in Brussels insist that every EU country not only accept a dictated number of refugees but also that every country then allow refugees to migrate freely within the EU. A \"hard Brexit\" would remove the requirement that Britain accept more refugees than it believes it can assimilate. Uncontrolled border crossings would end as modest checkpoints are reinstated.\\n\\nA separate border issue pertains to the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over goods. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and there has been much concern over continuing the free flow of goods into and out of the Republic of Ireland. This seems to be much ado about little. Most probably goods to and from the Republic of Ireland would be subject to random checks, with very little hindrance on trade. The EU has lobbied for an \"Irish backstop,\" whereby Northern Ireland would remain in the EU for some period of time. Naturally, this has incensed loyal British subjects, especially in Northern Ireland, and has almost no chance of being part of a \"soft Brexit\" deal.\\n\\nA Positive Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, the effect of a \"hard Brexit\" on Britain itself should be overwhelmingly positive, especially if Britain does, in fact, remove all tariffs and conclude free trade pacts with the rest of the world fairly quickly. Naturally, my advice to Britain is to unilaterally remove all tariffs on all goods, including \"sensitive industries.\" Free trade deals then become irrelevant. Britain could lead the way in showing the world the benefits of unilateral free trade, just as it did in the nineteenth century with the abolition of the Corn Laws. Perhaps this outcome is what the EU fears the most, because it would call into question the benefit of belonging to a closed customs union and would spell the end of the EU itself.\\n\\nDisclosure: No positions.\\n\\nEditor\\'s Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.', 'source': {'uri': 'seekingalpha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Seeking Alpha'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'mises_institute@seekingalpha.com', 'name': 'Mises Institute', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1294117647058823, 'wgt': 0}\n",

US equities reversed initial gains, but Asia Pacific equities edged higher, though Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday. European shares are struggling, as financials and consumer discretionary lead the 0.3% push lower. US shares are also trading with a heavier bias. Yields have come off and the US 10-year yield that had finished last week a little below 2.60% is now testing 2.50%. European 10-year yields are falling three to five basis points and puts the benchmark 10-year German Bund yield below five basis points for the first time since 2016. The US dollar is softer against the Antipodean currencies but is consolidating yesterday's losses against most of the other majors.\\n\\nAsia Pacific\\n\\nThe decline in Australia's unemployment rate concealed a deterioration of conditions a few days after the central bank underscored the importance of the labor market. The unexpected fall in unemployment to 4.9% from 5.0% reflected a decline in the participation rate (65.6% vs. 65.7%). Australia created a third of the jobs forecast (4.6k vs.15k) and there was a loss of 7.3k full-time posts. Similarly, in New Zealand, the optics look good but the details are less inspiring. Growth in Q4 accelerated from 0.3% in Q3 to 0.6%. However, the year-over-year pace slowed to 2.3% from 2.6%, its slowest pace since 2014.\\n\\nInvestors are closely watching Asian trade figures for signs of a recovery. South Korea reported that exports for the first 20 days of March fell 4.9% year over year. Here the news is really better than the optics. This decline shows a recovery from the first 10 days when exports cratered nearly 12%. Imports were off 3.4% after a 17.3% slump in the first 10 days. Separately, after keeping rates on hold as expected (note that Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines also kept policy steady today), Thailand reported an unexpected 5.9% gain in February exports year over year. They had fallen 5.65% in January. Imports, on the other hand, imploded, falling 10% after a 14% rise in January. The trade balance swung into surplus. The $4 bln surplus is the second largest since at least the early 1990s.\\n\\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority again intervened today to support the Hong Kong dollar. The size of the intervention remains modest and its take time for the cumulative effect to take hold. Part of the pressure is coming from interest rate differentials so the dovish Fed may help take some near-term pressure off. However, some of the pressure appears to be coming from capital flows into the mainland bond and stock markets. Consider that the mainland premium over the US on 10-year bonds has widened to over 60 bp a nearly 20 bp increase over the past month.\\n\\nThe Australian dollar approached $0.7170, its best level this month. The momentum could carry it closer to $0.7200, but we expect it to be seen as a lower risk sale near there. The dollar reversed lower against the yen yesterday (outside down day) and slipped a little more today (~JPY110.30), though local markets were on holiday. We suspect we have seen or approached the low and expect Japanese investors to take advantage of the yen's gains to buy foreign assets. There is an expiring (~$415 mln) option struck at JPY110.60 that could be in play. China set the reference rate for the dollar at its lowest level since July (dipping below CNY6.67, but throughout the mainland session the dollar gradually clawed back some of the losses to closed a little above CNY6.69.\\n\\nEurope\\n\\nBrexit remains a mess. Reports suggest that EC President Juncker cautioned the UK Prime Minister against requesting a delay past the European Parliament elections (end of May). Prime Minister May went ahead and sought a delay until the end of June. That little episode offers a microcosm of the entire process. May did not offer anything new and, of course, some other countries are balking. Just like Labour leader, Corbyn walked out of a meeting with the Prime Minister because he did not think that former Labour Umunna, who now heads up his own small party, is not legitimate, so too does Corbyn's talk with EU officials amount to much.\\n\\nHis plan is to stay in the customs union, but he is not authorized to speak for the UK. Indeed, despite the mess of Brexit, Labour under Corbyn continues to trail in national polls behind the Conservatives. A third vote on the Withdrawal Bill looks likely next Tuesday or Wednesday, according to reports. There is headline risk from today's EU summit. There will likely be another summit next week.\\n\\nNorges Bank, the central bank of Norway raised rates 25 bp today. It is the second hike in the cycle. The first was delivered last September. It signaled additional hikes were likely. Underlying inflation is a little above target and the oil sector is doing well. We are less sanguine. Industrial output fell 2.2% in the month of January and although January mainland GDP rose 0.3%. it was flat in November and December. Separately, the Swiss National Bank stood pat as widely anticipated. Its deposit rate remains at minus 75 bp.\\n\\nThe UK reported a 0.4% rise in retail sales. The median forecast from the Bloomberg survey was for a 0.4% decline. It follows a 0.9% rise in January. It is consistent with a recent string of constructive data. A month ago, the market was nearly split over the chances of a rate hike by the end of the year. Now there is about a one in five chance. As widely expected the BOE left policy on hold today.\\n\\nThere has been little market impact from center-right Dutch government losing its Senate majority yesterday. FvD, anti-immigration populist party has moved into second place. It shows that the appeal of populism is not simply in southern Europe. It is finding root in prosperous, successful countries as well. The wave does not look as if it has crested yet (see European Parliament elections).\\n\\nThe euro traded almost to $1.1450 yesterday after the FOMC but has not seen follow-through buying today. We had anticipated a test on $1.1400 this week after the ECB-induced drop below $1.12. While acknowledging the Fed was more dovish than expected, we don't see the euro sustaining an upside break above the upper end of the $1.13-$1.15 range that continues to confine most of the euro's price action.\\n\\nThe 200-day moving average is found near $1.1480. There are 2.5 bln euro in options between $1.1415 and $1.1430 that expire today. Support is pegged in the $1.1360-$1.1370 area. The sterling is trading sideways at the lower end of yesterday's ranges and failed to get a lift from the better-than-expected retail sales. It may be in a one-cent range of roughly $1.3115-$1.3215.\\n\\nAmerica\\n\\nThe FOMC was more dovish than expected. The one rate hike many economists, including ourselves, anticipated was pushed into next year. The balance sheet unwind will taper sooner than expected, and the confirmed end in September, the earliest date expected. The Fed's forecasts reflect an economy that is perceived to be past its cyclical peak. Powell said the US economy is fundamentally strong and the outlook was positive.\\n\\nDespite projecting above-trend growth this year and next and below 4% unemployment, with inflation remaining around the 2% target, the Fed deems it necessary to still provide monetary stimulus. The narrative that the Fed typically is slow to respond than overreact to inflation choking off the expansion is far from the mark, though it is repeated ad nauseam. The last three downturns were the function of financial excess and crisis (S&L, tech bubble, and the Great Financial Crisis).\\n\\nThe US awaits the March Philly Fed manufacturing survey. It is expected to rebound from February's -4.1 reading. Weekly initial jobless claims should slip a little and the February Leading Economic Indicator may post its first increase since last November.\\n\\nThe large drawdown of US oil stocks, sending May WTI above $60 a barrel, coupled with the dovish Fed, saw the greenback drop from around CAD1.3320 to about CAD1.3260. The reversal in equities saw the Canadian dollar pare its gains. It is trading quietly around CAD1.33 today. The Bank of Canada's rhetoric is also in transition and an easier bias in the coming period would be surprising. We still like the US dollar higher. The dollar Index closed below its 200-day moving average yesterday for the first time since last April. However, it is snapping back above it (~95.85) today. We see scope for a recovery and our first target is 96.50.\\n\\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.\", 'source': {'uri': 'seekingalpha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Seeking Alpha'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'marc_chandler@seekingalpha.com', 'name': 'Marc Chandler', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.09019607843137256, 'wgt': 0}\n",

Regardless of which side of the argument one takes, sadly, society still needs prisons, and probably always will. If you\\'re OK with the idea of investing in them, please read on.\\n\\nThe two biggest publicly-traded US prison operators are CoreCivic, (CXW) and The GEO Group (GEO), which are both REITs. CXW focuses on US properties only, while GEO also has a bit of overseas exposure.\\n\\nCXW operates with three segments - its traditional Safety segment, which holds the lion\\'s share of its properties; its Properties segment, which develops properties, such as a 400,00 square foot correctional facility under construction leased to the Kansas Department of Corrections, and its Community segment, which has grown to become the second-largest community corrections provider in the US. It\\'s the nation\\'s largest owner of partnership correctional, detention and residential reentry facilities.\\n\\nThe company also offers various rehabilitation and educational programs, including basic education, religious services, life skills and employment training, and substance abuse treatment, as well as food services, work and recreational programs, and healthcare services, such as medical, dental, and mental health services. In addition, it leases its facilities to third-party operators.\\n\\nIn addition to its US operations, GEO has four facilities in Australia, one in the UK, and one in South Africa. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and the US Marshals Service are its top three customers, with ~42% of total revenue:\\n\\nPerformance:\\n\\nCXW has outperformed GEO and the market in 2019, over the past month, quarter, and year to date. It does trail the S&P a bit over the past year, but, throw in its dividends, and it would have a better total return.\\n\\nValuations:\\n\\nCXW looks cheaper than GEO across the board on these valuations, including its price to trailing funds from operations - P/FFO, of 9.31X, vs. GEO\\'s P/FFO of 10.82.\\n\\nCXW just raised its 2019 guidance when it reported its Q1 \\'19 earnings this week. FFO/share guidance rose by 4.3%, to a $2.44 - $2.50 range, while diluted EPS guidance rose 7%.\\n\\nGEO\\'s management also raised its 2019 guidance, and management now expects full-year 2019 AFFO to be in a range of $2.64-$2.70 per diluted share, vs. their previous $2.50 - $2.60 range.\\n\\nThe problem with comparing the guidance is that CXW issued FFO guidance, but not AFFO guidance, while GEO issued AFFO guidance, but not FFO guidance.\\n\\nHowever, here\\'s how the updated 2019 low end of guidance compares to both firms\\' 2018 actuals: CXW earned $2.32 in FFO in 2018, so its $2.44 2019 guidance represents ~5.2% growth.\\n\\nGEO earned $2.47 in AFFO/share in 2018, so its $2.64 AFFO guidance is ~6.9% growth.\\n\\nThis valuations table uses data from the four quarters ending 3/31/19:\\n\\nCXW revised 2019 guidance: (Source: CXW site)\\n\\nDistributions:\\n\\nDue to their prior problems in 2015 - 2016, (see Risks section), both companies have lousy dividend growth figures. CXW\\'s management dropped the quarterly payout from $.54 to $.42 in Q4 \\'16, while GEO dropped its payout from $.70 to $.47 in Q1 \\'17.\\n\\nGEO\\'s management did raise it by a penny, to $.48 in Q1 \\'19, while CXW raised its dividend by a penny in Q1 \\'18, to $.43, and again in Q1 \\'19, to $.44.\\n\\nCXW has the more conservative FFO payout ratio, at 74.57%, vs. 83.91% for GEO.\\n\\nCXW has averaged an FFO/dividend payout ratio of 74.57% over the past four quarters - Q1 \\'19\\'s FFO ratio of 68.75% was its best figure since Q1 \\'17.\\n\\nTaxes:\\n\\nCXW had a minor amount of return of capital in its 2018 distributions - 7.75%.\\n\\n(Source: CXW site)\\n\\nGEO had 45.71% of its 2018 distributions classified as non-dividend, return of capital distributions:\\n\\n(Source: GEO site)\\n\\nAnalysts Price Targets:\\n\\nCXW is currently ~11% below analysts\\' lowest price target of $24.00 , and 13.4% below the consensus $24.50 price target.\\n\\nGEO is a bit closer to the low end, at 7% below its lowest $22.00 price target, but it\\'s a bit further away from its average target, at 14.3% below $23.50:\\n\\nOptions:\\n\\nWe feature option trades for CXW in our DoubleDividendStocks.com service, which we won\\'t divulge here, but we\\'ve worked up two trades for GEO.\\n\\nGEO\\'s December $22.50 call strike (which is just above the lowest price target for GEO) pays $.95 ~the same as its next two quarterly payouts, effectively allowing you to double your dividend.\\n\\nOur Covered Calls Table has more details for this and over 35 other covered call trades, which are updated throughout each trading day.\\n\\nConversely, if you\\'re leery of the various risks for GEO, you could try selling cash secured puts out of the money at a much lower price than GEO\\'s price/share.\\n\\nFor example, this December $17.50 put pays $1.10, a bit higher than GEO\\'s next two dividends, and it gives you a breakeven of $16.40, which is ~9.7% below GEO\\'s 52-week low, and ~17% below the $22.00 lowest price target.\\n\\nRisks:\\n\\nTo say that these firms have headline and political risk might be an understatement.\\n\\nFor example, JPMorgan Chase announced in March that it was withdrawing from doing any financing deals in the future with prisons as a result of its ongoing evaluations of the costs and benefits of serving different industries. Wells Fargo also announced in January that it was reducing its relationship with the prison industry as part of its \"environmental and social risk management\" process. (source)\\n\\nCXW shed 7.5% and GEO lost 8.6% over the next few days following the JPMorgan announcement. CXW has recovered in price since then, but GEO is still at a lower price level.\\n\\nCXW\\'s shares came under a lot of pressure in 2015-2016 as the Department of Justice issued a memo directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons - the BOP, to decrease facility renewals of private prison operators. CXW fell all the way from ~$40.00 to under $15.00, while GEO fell from the high $20\\'s to the low teens.\\n\\nCXW has eight facilities which are sitting idle, which are a drag on earnings, that management is marketing for redeployment to its customer base. It remains to be seen if they\\'ll end up writing down any of these facilities. Management does point out though that since these existing facilities are user/ready, they have an advantage in capex and quick deployment. GEO has 12 idle facilities.\\n\\nClass-action suit - There\\'s also a class-action suit vs. CXW, which claims that company execs misled the public about the quality of CXW\\'s facilities. The class-action suit is led by Amalgamated Bank, which says it lost $1.2M when stocks fell after a 2016 U.S. Department of Justice memorandum directed the Bureau of Prisons to phase out contracts with private operators.\\n\\nCXW\\'s management counters that the DOJ directive was later rescinded, and the stock fully recovered in price. They also said a similar shareholder lawsuit against private prison operator GEO Group was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida. (source)\\n\\nEarnings:\\n\\nCXW\\'s management responded to the 2015-16 DOJ pressures by diversifying the company\\'s customer base - they\\'ve decreased exposure to both the BOP and California by 9%, and also have shed 11% of low-margin, managed-only operations. They\\'ve picked up the slack via new business with USMS and ICE, state and local governments, and their more diversified community and properties segments.\\n\\nSource: (CXW site)\\n\\nAfter struggling with negative growth in Q2 \\'18 and turning in better reports in Q3 and Q4 \\'18, CXW exceeded analysts\\' earnings estimates for Q1 \\'19, and had much stronger growth figures. This growth gave management the confidence to raise 2019 guidance, as mentioned earlier.\\n\\nGEO\\'s much stronger Q1 \\'19 has lifted up its trailing growth figures, which are now positive for FFO and FFO/share. There was a small ~3% growth in payouts, and, with the share count roughly flat, the better FFO/AFFO growth led to modest improvements in CXW\\'s payout ratios:\\n\\nGEO had a similar earnings scenario, with much stronger growth in Q1 \\'19 than in 2018:\\n\\nFinancials:\\n\\nThe two companies\\' ROA and ROE ratios are roughly similar, but CXW has a much better Operating Margin. It also has much lower leverage than GEO, on a debt/equity, net debt/EBITDA, and net debt/FFO basis, in addition to having better EBITDA/Interest coverage.\\n\\nDebt:\\n\\nCXW\\'s next large debt maturity, $344M, comes in 2020, while GEO has $333M maturing in 2019.

The surge of the S&P 500 before the weekend failed to inspire today. Asia markets were mostly firmer, led by Japan, while China, Hong Kong, and Singapore moved lower. The Nikkei gapped higher, jumping above the 22k level that had been holding it back. It is at its best level since early last December. The US coattails are even shorter in Europe, where the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is little changed, with a three-day rally in tow. US shares are a little heavier. US Treasuries are consolidating the pre-weekend drop, which weighed on Asia-Pacific bonds earlier today, and European benchmark yields are firmer, with Italy bucking the trend. The dollar is mostly softer, with sterling and the Swedish krona the strongest of the majors (~0.20-0.25% higher), while the Australian and Canadian dollars are lightly softer, alongside the Norwegian krone. The South Korean won is the strongest of the emerging market currencies today, helped by the rally in US stocks and Chinese economic data.\\n\\nAsia Pacific\\n\\nUS Treasury Secretary Mnuchin suggested that the trade talks with China are nearly complete. He acknowledged, it seemed for the first time that the enforcement mechanism would work both ways, meaning that the US could also be subject to repercussions if it were to fail to make good on its commitments. Still, US officials have been claiming progress on a nearly daily basis. When a date is set for the next Trump-Xi meeting, that will be the best indication that a deal has been reached. Note that unlike NAFTA 2.0, this is not a treaty that requires Congressional approval. This is an executive agreement.\\n\\nThe US-Japanese trade negotiations begin in the middle of the week. This too will be an executive agreement that does not require approval from Congress. Some critics see these executive agreements as a way to bypass the legislative branch. Talks this week will lay the groundwork for Abe's US visit later this month. Part of the problem is that Japan has struck agreements with Europe and the Trans-Pacific Partnership and it now grants others greater access than the US. This has hit US agriculture, where US pork exports to Japan, for example, are off by more than a third this year. As the US insisted in the NAFTA 2.0 talks and in negotiations with China, it seeks protection against currency manipulation, which seems to be mostly a question of transparency of actions. Japan does not appear to have intervened in the foreign exchange market for several years.\\n\\nChina reports March industrial production and retail sales and Q1 GDP in the middle of the week. Sequentially, March industrial output and retail sales are expected to have improved, while Q1 GDP is expected to have slowed to 6.3% (year-over-year) from 6.4%. Chinese lending and trade figures released last week confirm officials have switched gears and are doing more to support the economy. The strong export figures are good for China but also reflect stronger world demand.\\n\\nThe dollar has been confined to about a 10-tick range on either side of JPY112.00, where a $640 million option expires today. Technically, a convincing move above JPY112 would target JPY114. We remain concerned that not only is the Japanese economy struggling to show any meaningful traction but the closure of the markets for a long period at the end of the month, as the abdication of the Emperor and the ascension of the new Emperor, is potentially disruptive. The market is pausing after bringing the Australian dollar close to $0.7200. It has not closed above this level in more than two months, and the market has not given up on it. Initial support is seen in the $0.7140-$0.7160 band. Foreign investors continue to favor South Korean shares. This month, they have plunked down more than $2.0 after buying more than $4.5 billion in Q1. Demand for Indian shares appears to have cooled this month after foreigners bought roughly $8.2 billion in Q1.\\n\\nEurope\\n\\nThe UK Parliament is on recess until April 23. In the meantime, the government and Labour continue to talk. The situation still looks fluid and there continues to be talk of some kind of customs union arrangement. A referendum on the final agreement remains an open possibility. In the end, maybe it will be reminiscent of how France removed its troops from joint NATO command, but still exercised and prepared with NATO and later relented, and its forces were again part of NATO's command structure. Observers will scrutinize the May 3 local elections for signs of the political consequences.\\n\\nThe Social Democrats came out narrowly ahead in the national elections in Finland for the first time in 16 years. The populist Finns came in second. It has added hostility to policies (and taxes) meant to address climate change to its anti-immigration rhetoric. The market reaction appears to be limited to some additional pressure on the short end of its curve, where the two-year yield is up four-five basis points, the worst performer in Europe. The stock market is heavy, losing about 0.4% today and paring this month's gain to a still-impressive 3.6%. The 10-year yield is up half a basis point at 0.27%. The Social Democrats now need to forge a coalition, and this may force it to be centrist.\\n\\nAn estimated 31k Yellow Vest protesters took to the streets this past weekend. This evening in Paris (before the US equities close), President Macron will make a national address. Later this week, Markit will report the flash April PMI. Recall in March that both the manufacturing and service PMIs were below the 50 boom/bust level. While France's voice in Europe has not lessened, as illustrated by the shorter Brexit extension than the European Council President Tusk proposed, the economic weakness keeps Macron on the defensive nationally. The European Parliament elections at the end of next month may see him punished.\\n\\nThe euro is consolidating last week's gains that took it above $1.13 for the first time since March 26. It has not managed to push through the pre-weekend high of just below $1.1325. There is an option for 555 million euros at $1.1335 that will be cut today. Chart resistance is seen near $1.1350, though some are talking about a move to $1.1400. Initial support is pegged near $1.1290, and a break of $1.1280 would likely signal a near-term top and the start of a potential reversal. Sterling is firm in a narrow range. The general consolidative tone remains intact. The $1.3120 area is important. It houses a GBP300 million option that expires today and the 20-day moving average. Sterling has not closed above its 20-day moving average since March 27. Support is pegged near $1.3050.\\n\\nAmerica\\n\\nPresident Trump again took to Twitter to criticize the Federal Reserve, claiming the stock market and the economy would be much stronger had the central bank not engaged in quantitative tightening. The President's comments and his candidates for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors have sparked widespread criticism and concern about the central bank's independence. ECB Draghi, who rarely comments on US developments, expressed concern about the Fed's independence. Although we will address it in a longer note later, for now, allow us to make two points. First, observers may be tut-tutting, but investors see past it. Market prices, level of interest rates and the slope of the curve do not indicate investor concern that the Fed has been compromised. Second, neither Moore nor Cain has been officially nominated. The Senate has sometimes failed to confirm nominees. Many expect Cain to remove himself or that the President does not go forward with the nomination. The power of appointment to the central bank is the approved way to influence the direction of monetary policy in many countries, leaving aside the ECB. The system of checks and balances is working.\\n\\nEight Fed officials speak this week, beginning today with Evans and Rosengren. The data diary begins with among the first looks at April (outside of the weekly jobless claims which point to a robust labor market). It is expected to have improved, but this week's focus is on March industrial output and retail sales. Both are expected to have improved sequentially. Also this week, earnings from the financial sector are among the highlights. Canada reports March existing home sales today. They fell 9% in February, and a small bounce is expected. The Canadian dollar will likely be the brunt of disappointment. The Bank of Canada's Senior Loan Officer Survey results will also be announced.\\n\\nThe Dollar Index is trading in a narrow range near the pre-weekend low (~96.75). Additional support is seen near 96.60. Some observers think that stale longs have to be forced out and this may take a push through the 200-day moving average (~96.10). With a few minor exceptions, the US dollar has chopped between CAD1.33 and CAD1.34. Playing the range makes money now for the nimble, but leaves on not necessarily prepared for an eventual breakout. Meanwhile, the market seems reluctant to extend the greenback's 3.5% two-week loss against the Mexican peso. It is finding a modest bid near MXN18.75.\\n\\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.\", 'source': {'uri': 'seekingalpha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Seeking Alpha'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'marc_chandler@seekingalpha.com', 'name': 'Marc Chandler', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.192156862745098, 'wgt': 0}\n",

When we last covered Northview, we concluded:\\n\\nNorthview is the only apartment REIT we own, and we have no desire to let go of it. The stock has underperformed its peers, although a 10.5% total return puts it in the top quartile of all Canadian REITs. 2019 should shape up to be a banner year, and Northview should get its long-awaited rightful multiple.\\n\\nFor the conclusion to his March 12th article, he wrote:\\n\\nAt about 13x our FFO estimates alongside a 15% discount to our estimated NAV, Northview is certainly not expensive. Boardwalk REIT (OTCPK:OTCPK:BOWFF) trades at far higher multiples and yields so little that you might confuse it with a Treasury bond. We hence wholeheartedly endorse that Northview should trade three multiples higher. We are still disappointed that the overall numbers have come in lower than we anticipated. We hence sold some of our position at $29.19 CAD as we believe that there are some better opportunities elsewhere. The stock is still a good long-term holding for someone who wants a lower risk apartment play with a management that has proven ability to grow the business. We may buyback our sold units should the price retreat or Northview follows through with a secondary offering.\\n\\nI follow Trapping Value on Seeking Alpha and respect his analysis and writing. My intention in this article is not to launch into a public debate with him, but simply to provide another viewpoint to the major points he made in his article. Before doing so, I thought it might be useful for readers who may not be familiar with Northview, to provide some foundational information on the REIT, including an analysis of its most recently reported financial and operational results for its fourth quarter and full year 2018, which it released on February 27, 2019.\\n\\nNorthview Apartment REIT (Northview) began as Northern Property REIT, initially listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2002. Northview is an unincorporated, open-ended real estate investment trust. The REIT is a multi-family residential real estate investor and operator that provides a spectrum of rental accommodations with a portfolio of 1.2 million square feet of commercial space, including 27,000 quality residential suites in more than 60 markets across eight provinces and two territories in Canada. Northview\\'s well-diversified portfolio includes markets characterized by expanding populations and growing economies, which provides Northview the means to deliver stable and growing profitability and distributions to unitholders.\\n\\nSource: The Globe and Mail newspaper\\n\\nNorthview\\'s residential portfolio includes a multi-family segment comprising apartments, townhomes and single-family rental units, plus an execusuites and hotel segment, where rental period ranges from a few days to several months.\\n\\nNorthview has a smaller commercial business segment, which includes office, industrial and retail properties in areas where the company has residential operations. Its geographic segments include Atlantic Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), Northern Canada (Northwest Territories and Nunavut), Ontario, Quebec and Western Canada (British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan).\\n\\nSource: Northview 2018 annual report\\n\\nAs the name suggests, Northview\\'s roots are in Canada\\'s North, but it has grown and \"remodeled\" itself over the years. Northview is now located in many of Canada\\'s largest urban areas and key secondary markets across the country. In many of its operating regions, it is the leading residential landlord. Northview Apartment REIT -- formerly known as Northern Property REIT -- came into being in 2015 following Northern Property REIT\\'s acquisition of True North Apartment REIT, plus a 4,650-multi-family suite portfolio of properties from Starlight Investments and the Public Service Pension Plan, as a key thrust in its strategy to diversify and lessen its heavy weighting to Northern and Western Canada. The diversification achieved from the True North transaction added high-quality, strong-performing assets to the portfolio.\\n\\nSource: Northview Apartment REIT website\\n\\nPrior to the True North transaction, Northern Properties REIT traded more like an energy stock, with a 90%-plus price correlation to the price of oil. The way it would protect itself was through diversification. Prior to the True North acquisition, Northern Property REIT had been diversifying one building at a time. This can be accomplished, but not likely in one CEO\\'s tenure. Hence the True North transaction which, in one fell swoop, gave Northern Property REIT 14,000 additional units and a large presence in Ontario, Montreal and in the Maritime Provinces of Canada. Ontario now accounts for more than one-third of Northview\\'s net operating income (NOI) while Western Canada has been reduced to about 20%.\\n\\nWhile shareholders at the time were uneasy with the $3-billion marriage between Northern Property REIT and True North Apartment REIT, I didn\\'t own the stock then and I don\\'t share that perspective now. I have a long investment horizon. My ideal holding period is \"Forever.\" While Northview\\'s stock came under pressure from the double-whammy of the collapse in oil prices in 2014 and the True-North transaction in 2015, given my long investment horizon, I viewed this as an opportunity to buy units of a high-quality, high-dividend paying REIT with a strong, experienced management team and priced at an attractive valuation -- which is exactly what I did.\\n\\nThe True North acquisition gave Northview an opportunity to diversify its portfolio, stabilize its earnings, and importantly, to create value for its unitholders, while displaying imanagement\\'s strong stewardship of capital in recognizing and addressing the risks in its geographically concentrated portfolio -- and then addressing those risks.\\n\\nThe term \"transformative transaction\" is overused in corporate public-relations M&A communications, but it is appropriate to describe the True North acquisition. Prior to this transaction, Northern Property REIT owned a portfolio of properties that were heavily skewed toward Alberta and Northern Canada, with apartment units in places like Iqaluit and Yellowknife. True North Apartment REIT, on the other hand, was focused on apartment units in Ontario.\\n\\nThe True North acquisition was Northview\\'s path to diversify its portfolio and provide greater cash-flow stability by increasing its exposure to larger, more stable markets, particularly in Ontario, and to a lesser extent Quebec and Atlantic Canada, which combined now account for about 50% of Northview\\'s NOI.\\n\\nAs a result, Northview\\'s exposure to resource-based regions has been reduced to less than 20% of NOI. And the REIT continues to diversify strategically to drive growth and reduce risk. Northview\\'s increasingly diverse geographic footprint underpins management\\'s strategy to deliver growing profitability and distributions to unitholders over the long term.\\n\\nIn addition, the True North transaction immediately catapulted Northview Apartment REIT to its current position as Canada\\'s third-largest multi-family REIT, with a national platform and increasingly diverse portfolio. In addition, it provided Northview with improved access to capital and opportunities for growth outside its traditional mid-market communities, and reduced the REIT\\'s proportionate energy-market exposure.\\n\\nNorthview President and CEO Todd Cook has been open and generous to me with what I suspect is his most precious commodity; namely, his time. In my discussions with Mr. Cook following the True North acquisition, he told me:\\n\\nThe diversification achieved in the True North transaction added high-quality, strong-performing assets to the portfolio and reduced the relative impact of Alberta. Our steady markets are performing well and continue to provide organic growth opportunities for our unitholders.\"\\n\\nNorthview has focused on a value-add strategy for several years through its Value Creation Initiatives (NYSE:VCI) of renovating existing apartment buildings. The REIT can realize a 24% return on a $17,000-per-door investment to upgrade buildings to condominium quality. But this has a shelf life unless you are adding new product, so Northview is also concentrating on developing new buildings.\\n\\nDevelopment Pipeline Continues to Add Value\\n\\nIn 2018 Northview completed three development projects for a total cost of $60 million. With lease-up progressing well -- The Peaks in Canmore, which was completed late last summer, is 85% leased. -- All projects are on-track to achieve their weighted-average development yield of 7.6% on cost. As such, Northview recorded a $12.6 million increase in fair value, equating to a created-value lift of 21% on cost. On the project initiation front, Northview notes that the planning and approval process for its Kitchener, Ontario development continues to progress and it expects to be \"shovel in the ground\" in the first half of 2019 in both Kitchener and with its Nanaimo, BC project.\\n\\nNorthview\\'s \"The Peaks\" Development in Canmore\\n\\nSource: Google images\\n\\nI wrote my first article for Seeking Alpha on Northview Apartment REIT almost two years ago, on April 17, 2017. The title I gave that article was Northview Apartment REIT - A Hidden Gem. On that date in 2017, Northview\\'s units closed at $22.86 and were yielding a very attractive 7.14%. Today, the units are trading at $28.14, with a still healthy yield of 5.79%, for a respectable total return of 30.4%, including the distribution, over this 23-month period. In my April 17th article on Northview, I rated the stock \"Outperform\" reflecting:\\n\\nIts discounted valuation; Its long-term growth potential; The defensive nature of its multi-residential properties; Its high, sustainable yield; and Management\\'s strong record on execution and capital allocation.\\n\\nThese investment attributes are still germane today. As stewards of investors\\' capital, every corporate management team and board face tradeoffs. The balance of reinvesting retained earnings back into the business, pursuing value-accretive acquisitions and returning capital to investors in the form of dividends and buybacks are among them. The Northview management team, led by President and CEO Todd Cook, have displayed a canny aptitude as capital allocators.\\n\\nIn explaining my \"Hidden Gem\" analogy in that article from 2017, I wrote:\\n\\nNot all stocks receive the same public attention. I spend a consistent proportion of my investment time and attention delving for \"Hidden Gems\" - solid companies with strong, experienced management teams and broad, defensible economic moats that operate beyond the intense glare of the public-market spotlight. Their stocks are often surprisingly attractive.\\n\\nIt is not always for fundamental reasons that a particular company is not broadly followed by the investment community. And there can be benefits in uncovering these \"diamonds in the rough.\" Unlike better known names that are scrutinized to death, \"hidden gems\" like Northview Apartment REIT, which have lived in the shadows, can possess attributes that are not reflected in their valuations.\"\\n\\nIn-Line Fourth Quarter -- Solid Finish to 2018\\n\\nNorthview reported solid fourth-quarter 2018 results, capping a good finish to 2018, highlighted by the 8th consecutive year of same-property net operating income (SP NOI) growth in its Multi-Family portfolio (up 5.1%) led by Ontario, which represents 36% of Multi-Family NOI. Ontario SP NOI was up 11.9%.\\n\\nThe REIT reported FFO per diluted unit of $0.50, down 2% year-over-year, but ahead of analysts\\' consensus estimate of $0.48. The year-over-year decline was due in part to temporary dilution from the equity raise during the year, the proceeds of which were not fully deployed.\\n\\nBetter economic conditions across all regions, higher average monthly rents (AMRs) across the portfolio, and successful execution of its Value Creation Initiatives, particularly in Ontario, were key drivers. The VCI program is bearing fruit. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Northview invested $3.5 million to upgrade 123 suites. On average, monthly rents for suites upgraded during the quarter increased $291 per suite. Since beginning its VCIs, the program has contributed $10.5 million of annualized NOI.\\n\\nWhile performance remains somewhat mixed by region, those with the most weight have being putting up the stronger numbers, and 2018 felt like a turning point for the REIT.\\n\\nSource: Northview Apartment REIT Q4 2018 results call slide\\n\\nCash flow from operating activities was $139.1 million for full-year 2018, a $47.7 million increase compared to 2017. Net and comprehensive income was $289.6 million for the year, a $77.3 million increase compared to 2017, primarily as a result of fair value increases on investment properties. Contributing to the strong performance was the further diversification of the portfolio into Northview\\'s stronger markets across the country, as evidenced its same door NOI growth and fair value increases.\\n\\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) book value per share (BVPU) at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 was $28.55, which was up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year, driven by substantial net fair value mark-ups of $122 million or $1.88/unit in Q4 2018 and $167 million or $2.58/unit for full-year 2018.\\n\\nSource: Northview Apartment REIT Q4 2018 results call slides\\n\\nAs Northview President and CEO Todd Cook commented in the fourth-quarter and full-year press release:\\n\\n...2018 was a very successful year for Northview. Instrumental to the ongoing strong performance was the diversification of the portfolio into our stronger markets across the country, as evidenced by same door NOI growth and fair value increases.\\n\\nThe fair value gains realized on our properties, combined with issuing $177 million of equity to fund acquisitions and developments, contributed to a decrease in leverage of 260 basis points, bringing our debt to gross book value to 53.8%, which is within our target range. With our improving balance sheet, experienced leadership team, and proven track record, Northview is well positioned to continue its strategy and to deliver unitholder value in 2019.\"\\n\\nImportantly, Northview\\'s significant leverage reduction in 2018 positions it to transition from simply disposing of non-core assets to capital recycling, where further asset sales are more than offset by accretive acquisitions and development. Harvesting capital and redeploying it into higher return endeavors will contribute to income and value growth, while improving leverage metrics.\\n\\nNorthview achieved almost $400 million of growth through acquisitions and developments completed during 2018 and expects to begin construction on developments in Kitchener, Ontario and Nanaimo, British Columbia during the first half of this year. The Kitchener project, which is Northview\\'s first concrete high-rise development, will be completed in two phases with 340 suites in total. Total cost is expected to be about $100 million, with a target development yield in the range of 5.0% to 5.5%. The two buildings in Northview\\'s $30 million Calgary development are expected to begin lease-up in April of this year.\\n\\nNorthview was also active on the acquisition front, particularity in Ontario, where it acquired 1,154 suites, including 644 in December 2018 for $132 million. This latest acquisition brought total acquisitions for the year to just over $333 million. The acquisitions, combined with the solid growth in the fair value of the REIT\\'s assets, bumped its assets up to nearly $4.1 billion.\\n\\nWith Ontario multi-family fundamentals showing no signs of weakening, I expect Northview will continue to be rewarded for growing its presence in the province. I also see near-term upside through the REIT\\'s high-end renovation (HER) program, which as been achieving returns in excess of 20%. Management has identified 4,800 suites across the portfolio that are suitable for the program and expects to complete up to 800 units in 2019.\\n\\nStrengthening fundamentals across the majority of the REIT\\'s portfolio, the execution of its suite-improvement program, and the its development program should more than offset any weaker geographic regions in the near-term.\\n\\nWith this foundational update to Northview\\'s operational and financial results, I will now address the key points in Trapping Value\\'s article. I have identified his points by prefacing them with \"Trapping Value\" and highlighting them in bold italic lettering. I provide my answer immediately below each of his points in a section headed \"Response.\"\\n\\nNorthview President and CEO Todd Cook was generous in responding to my questions when I was writing my two previous articles on the company. I approached him again with my idea for this article. Mr. Cook agreed to help out again and steered me to Andrew Phonsavath, who is Corporate Financial Planning & Investor Relations Manager at Northview. (From my exposure to the company, it strikes to me that most employees hold at least two functions in their job titles -- usually a good sign of a fast-paced, efficient company, in my experience.) So the responses to Trapping Value\\'s points are a combination of their and my contributions. The quotes in this article from Northview President and CEO Todd Cook are his words alone.\\n\\nTrapping Value: Where did the growth go?\\n\\nResponse\\n\\nNorthview\\'s growth strategy is supported by three pillars:\\n\\nOrganic growth Developments Acquisitions\\n\\nNorthview continues to display strong organic growth across its portfolio, with $308 million of fair value increases recorded in 2017 and 2018.\\n\\nNorthview\\'s developments portfolio is generating 100 to 200 basis points above market capitalization rates and getting a fair-value lift upon completion. For projects completed in 2018, the REIT recorded $13 million in fair value increases.\\n\\nNorthview continues to find quality assets and opportunities to expand beyond its high-end renovation program, which itself yields 15% to 20%. For example, in its December 2017 acquisition, it recorded $17 million of fair value and an average monthly rent increase of 5.6%.\\n\\nNorthview President and CEO Todd Cook provided further granularity when he pointed out exclusively for this article:\\n\\nWe completed over $600 million of growth through acquisitions and developments since late 2017. Based on our proven track record, we have demonstrated success increasing asset value on recent acquisitions and completed developments. We look to continue to generate NAV growth for our Unitholders.\"\\n\\nTrapping Value: FFOPU (funds from operations per unit) weaker and barely increased over the previous year\\n\\nResponse\\n\\nThe majority of the proceeds from the equity issuances in 2018 were used to fund growth. In addition to the public offering of $142 million in June, Northview completed a private equity issuance of $35 million to Starlight Group Property Holdings Inc. in December. Starlight is a real estate asset management company focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of commercial and residential properties across Canada and the US. Starlight founder, president and CEO, Daniel Drimmer is also a Northview Trustee and significant unitholder.\\n\\nNorthview\\'s strategic relationship with Starlight provides an acquisition pipeline, plus savings on a private equity issuance of about 8%, as the cost of a public offering typically includes a 3% discount plus 5% commission and closing costs. The private equity issuance of $35 million equity was issued at $27.00 per unit, a premium to Northview\\'s unit price at the time.\\n\\nThe remaining use of proceeds from the equity offerings were applied to reduce leverage. In addition, Northview had $167 million of fair-value increases that contributed to lower leverage in 2018. Northview has accomplished reducing its leverage to its targeted range of 50% to 55%. Since the peak in 2016, leverage has improved over 6% from 60.2% to 53.8%\\n\\nTrapping Values: Northview has eschewed FFO growth and preferred instead to focus on reducing leverage. Whether Northview delivers on our targets will depend heavily on whether it allows portfolio growth to flow through or continues with more equity offerings.\\n\\nResponse\\n\\nClearly, there must be a balance among the four components of:\\n\\nFFO growth; Leverage reduction; Pace of acquisitions; Pace of developments.\\n\\nNorthview recognizes this and is progressing in lockstep with its strategic plan. It expects to ease off on its pace of acquisitions following its aggressive clip in 2018.\\n\\nThe acquisitions provide Northview with opportunities to generate significant income and net asset value (NYSE:NAV) growth through its High End Renovation program across its acquired properties. The acquisitions are consistent with Northview\\'s strategy of expanding its high-quality portfolio in strong and growing markets and increases the number of future potential units eligible for its successful HER program, which will drive further organic growth.\\n\\nFrom a metrics standpoint, same door NOI is up 4.5%; NAV increased about $3 since the beginning of 2018; leverage has improved; FFO growth remains positive and is set to increase, supported by acquisition/disposition capital recycling; Valuation Creation Initiatives and High End Renovation contributions. The REIT continues to successfully deliver on its strategy of strong organic growth and portfolio diversification through acquisitions and developments.\\n\\nSafety of Distribution\\n\\nNorthview\\'s solid balance sheet and reasonable payout ratio underpin its ability to provide attractive and growing distributions to its unitholders, while at the same time supporting future business growth. Northview\\'s long-term objective is to maintain a conservative distribution FFO payout ratio of about 70%.\\n\\nNorthview has a long history of paying and, periodically, increasing its distribution. In the last 14 years, the REIT has increased its distribution eight times. And in the past 17 years, its payout ratio has been declining, from 91% in 2002 to 76.7% today. I value the evidence that Northview management runs the business prudently, providing a margin of safety for its distribution and I believe Northview\\'s distribution is sustainable for the long term.\\n\\nOn a February 28th, I \"asked\" Northview CEO Todd Cook in an email, \"Now that the finances are in increasingly good shape -- and continue to improve -- the next strong attestation of progress and confidence in the future would be steady (annual) distribution increases. If you could make it onto the list of Canadian Dividend Aristocrats, that would open up a new new class of potential shareholders.\"\\n\\nMr. Cook, as usual, responded promptly in his typical candid fashion, \"We have been in the aristocrat index previously. For now we are focused on current business plan and do not have immediate plans to increase distributions.\"\\n\\nNorthview maintains a conservative, sustainable payout, which complements and supports its attractive 5.79% yield. I look forward to the time when Northview will be back on the Canadian Dividend Aristocrats list.\\n\\nLeverage and Liquidity\\n\\nNorthview\\'s fourth-quarter 2018 debt-to-gross-book-value (D/GBV) ratio of 53.8% was 80 basis points lower than the third quarter\\'s 54.6% and 260 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2017\\'s 56.4%. Additionally, its fourth quarter 2018 D/GBV ratio was its lowest ratio since the third quarter of 2015 and it is now within management\\'s target range of 50% to 55%. The lower leverage results from its June 25, 2018 equity raise of $127-million and 2018\\'s net fair value increase on investment properties of $167 million.\\n\\nSource: Northview Apartment REIT Q4 2018 results call slide Investment Conclusion\\n\\nNorthview is a $4-billion Enterprise Value apartment-focused REIT that is increasingly well-positioned to generate total returns -- cash flow/unit and NAV/unit growth through:\\n\\nNorthview has a well-diversified multi-family portfolio, which allows for stable returns and distributions, with flexibility for growth opportunities. The REIT\\'s high-quality portfolio is generally located in markets with expanding populations and growing economies. Northview focuses on increasing SPNOI through its valuation-creation initiatives, improving occupancy, average monthly rent step-ups, and operating efficiencies to reduce expenses.\\n\\nNorthview acquires properties in strong markets across the country, in particular, where it has an established operating platform and market knowledge. Northview has a strategic relationship with Starlight Group Property Holdings that has helped generate portfolio diversification. Northview has a well-diversified multi-family portfolio, which allows for stable returns and distributions, with flexibility for growth opportunities.\\n\\nNorthview has good expertise and a solid track record in this area, which, together with its diversified portfolio, means the REIT can target developments in strong markets with yields of up to 200 basis points higher than than prevailing market capitalization rates to help torque NAV growth. Northview typically has between one and four projects under construction. The REIT conducts development in a very measured way to augment NAV growth.\\n\\nNorthview has an active development program, which creates another opportunity for its expansion in Central and Eastern Canadian markets. Northview currently trades at a 50% of the multiple afforded to several of its residential peers; I expect the REIT\\'s discount to narrow as it continues to shift its exposure towards these geographies.\\n\\nSource: FactSet\\n\\nCore Holding\\n\\nMy ideal holding period is Forever. Northview is a core holding, reflecting its blue-chip capital structure, conservative management and strong market position in supply-constrained apartment markets in northern Canada, supplemented with it presence in high-growth Ontario markets\\n\\nThe continuous strengthening across the portfolio, the execution of its high-end renovation suite-upgrade program, plus the its current major development program should continue to drive growth.\\n\\nNorthview continues to successfully deliver on its strategy of strong organic growth and portfolio/geographic diversification through acquisitions and developments. And it continues to benefit from its Value Creation Initiatives, the full internalization of property management, and gradual recovery in many western markets. In fact, its Value Creation Initiatives are ahead of schedule. Northview expects total Value Creation Initiatives to yield $295 million by 2020 -- well ahead of the initial five-year target of $260 million it established in 2015.\\n\\nDespite an investment profile that is increasingly converging toward its larger peers, with leverage trending lower and geographic exposure progressively expanding and shifting towards non-resource based markets, Northview\\'s valuation discount to its closest peers continues. The REIT\\'s demonstrated value-creation program provides the basis for an above-average growth profile, which should in time deliver a premium valuation.\\n\\nI am maintaining my \"Outperform\" rating and increasing my target price to $32.00. My Outperform rating reflects Northview\\'s defensive nature, its long-term growth potential, discounted valuation to its closest peers, and its high and sustainable yield. I consider Northview a core holding, reflecting its solid capital structure, experienced and cohesive management team and dominant market position in supply-constrained apartment markets in Northern Canada, complemented by its presence in high-growth Ontario markets, including the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).\\n\\nDespite substantially improving the geographic mix of its portfolio over the past three years, Northview is trading 10 percentage points below its long-term average discount on P/FTM AFFO versus its closest peers. With a 5.8% yield, it looks like it could deliver a total return of 15% to 20% over the next 12 months with little risk.\\n\\nNorthview is well positioned to benefit from apartment fundamentals in Canada, which have never been stronger, due to a combination of strong immigration, recently introduced stricter mortgage regulations, a healthy economy and a lack of supply. As Canada\\'s third-largest apartment REIT, featuring a geographically diversified portfolio totalling approximately 27,000 suites and a fully internalized operating platform, Northview is well positioned to benefit from this macro tailwind. I expect Northview to deliver solid SPNOI growth in 2019 as occupancy and rental growth continue to trend in a positively.\\n\\nRisks to Rating and Price Target\\n\\nMulti-family residential properties are generally considered stable investments, given their diversified tenant base and their necessity-based product. With the True North acquisition, Northview immediately reduced its risk profile by becoming the third largest Canadian apartment REIT and, at the same time, reducing its exposure to energy-dependent markets.\\n\\nSpecific risks include the potential for an unanticipated increase in interest rates, an unexpected deterioration in residential and commercial space leasing conditions in Northview\\'s markets and a diversion of investor capital flows away from high-yielding real estate equities towards other asset classes.\\n\\nThank you for making it this far in the article.

They\\'re not, however, thriving en masse in direct response to Trump administration and Republican policies.\\n\\nSmall business hiring is erratic, according to numbers released by payroll provider ADP. Small businesses typically struggle to add jobs when the unemployment rate is very low, as it is now, at 3.8%. They often can\\'t pay as much as larger companies or offer the comparatively robust benefits that big companies do, thereby leaving them at a disadvantage when workers are scarce.\\n\\nMeanwhile, surveys by Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and MetLife show small business owners have been losing some of their optimism as doubts linger about the strength of the current economic expansion. The new tax law has had a mixed impact on small businesses and the trade war that began with Trump administration tariffs is hurting small manufacturers and retailers.\\n\\n\"Business is good, OK, but no different from how it\\'s been throughout the bulk of this expansion,\" says Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody\\'s Analytics. \"It\\'s hard to argue that the president\\'s policies have led to some kind of renaissance for small businesses that\\'s going to mean great things forever.\"\\n\\nThe administration believes otherwise. Former Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, in an opinion piece published last week on FoxBusiness.com, credited the administration\\'s policies for helping the economy and in turn, small companies. She noted that she met with small business owners throughout her SBA tenure.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t need a spreadsheet to tell me the president\\'s America first program of tax, trade, regulatory and energy reform is supercharging our economy,\" says McMahon, who resigned last month to work on President Donald Trump\\'s re-election campaign. \"I saw it and continue to see it with my own eyes -- and through the eyes of the hundreds of business leaders I have met.\"\\n\\nIn a letter released last month by the SBA, Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Michelle Christian said, \"we see small business owners taking advantage of the tax cuts and deregulation efforts led by President Trump to invest in their companies and their employees by raising wages, providing bonuses, increasing benefits, and creating more jobs. The economy is strong, and small businesses are thriving.\"\\n\\nEconomists and industry group officials see administration and GOP policies as having a mixed impact on small businesses -- how a company is affected depends on the policy and the business\\'s individual circumstances. But even if a company has benefited from one policy, it might be hurt by another.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been one step forward and one step back,\" says David French, senior vice president of government relations at the industry group National Retail Federation. \"A lot of the positive gains we\\'ve seen out of tax reform have been given back in lost sales and lost opportunities because of higher tariffs.\"\\n\\nThe administration\\'s tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese and European products have sent costs higher for small businesses including manufacturers and retailers.\\n\\nIt can be a mistake to generalize about the companies that will be the focus of National Small Business Week May 5-11. The expression \"small business\" is used to describe companies with relatively few employees and small revenues compared to large companies with thousands of workers and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars coming in annually. But there is no typical small business -- a retailer, dry cleaner, restaurant, manufacturer, dental office or auto mechanic can be a small business. Because these companies have vastly different structures, products and services, they have widely divergent needs and priorities, and government policies have a varying impact on them.\\n\\nThe tax law has had an uneven impact. Not all sole proprietors, partners and owners of what are called S corporations can take a new 20% deduction against their business income; the provision excludes some industries and depends on filing status. For example, an owner of a small business whose spouse had high earnings from a job or other source might not qualify for the deduction. Nor could many people with professional practices such as doctors, architects and consultants. And while the law lowered the maximum corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, the rate went up for many small corporations.\\n\\nUnder the previous tax law, Sandra Payne\\'s construction equipment manufacturer had a 15% tax rate on the first $50,000 in income. Under the new law, that rose to 21%.\\n\\n\"That was huge to us; it was a big deal,\" says Payne, president of Denver Concrete Vibrator in Colorado.\\n\\nMichael Rogers estimates he saved about $3,100 in taxes because he was able to claim the 20% deduction for what\\'s known as qualified business income from his Cleveland, Tennessee, real estate company, Chandler Properties. But the money won\\'t be reinvested in his business; it will go to Rogers\\' family of four children.\\n\\nOverall, it appears the tax law didn\\'t help small businesses as much as the GOP predicted. In a Bank of America survey of 1,504 small business owners released last week, 28% said the government\\'s tax policy has been positive for their companies, down from the 45% who predicted a year ago it would be positive for them. Half said it was neutral, up from 39%, and 21% said the policy was negative for their companies, up from 15%.\\n\\nMeanwhile, although Trump contends his trade policy is helping business, billions of dollars in taxes on Chinese and European imports and retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods have driven up prices for small companies and their customers. In the Federal Reserve\\'s most recent Beige Book, its assessment of regional economies, eight of the 12 regional Fed banks reported businesses were affected by or concerned about tariffs that run as high as 25% on some products. While the April 17 report did not identify any of the companies as small businesses, it does show tariffs are an ongoing issue.\\n\\nThe tariffs are also negating some tax benefits under the new law, the NRF\\'s French says.\\n\\n\"If retailers benefit by consumers having more disposable income to spend, a portion of that disposable income has gone to tariffs,\" he says.\\n\\nIn a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in February, researchers found that tariffs already in place on Chinese imports have added 0.1 percentage point to consumer price inflation, a relatively small amount, and that the contribution of Chinese imports to overall personal consumption and business investment are also small. However, the report said, \"when faced with tariffs as high as 25% on a broad set of product categories, even these small shares can lead to sizable upward pressures on prices.\"\\n\\nPayne\\'s company, which uses steel and other raw materials that have been hit by tariffs, is paying higher prices to suppliers.\\n\\n\"All of our vendors are getting ready or have already increased prices in anticipation of the tariff issues,\" she says.\\n\\nThe U.S. economy grew at a solid 3.2% in the first three months of the year, but economists don\\'t expect the current April-June quarter to match that performance. Many are looking for gross domestic product growth to slow to around an annual rate of 2% in the current quarter. A weakening economy can lead to a drop in hiring, which has been inconsistent at small businesses. While ADP counted 77,000 new small business jobs in April and 20,000 in March, that compared to an average 52,000 per month in 2018. Although many businesses say they\\'re unable to find skilled workers -- a problem Zandi says is exacerbated by the administration\\'s immigration policies -- some business owners have said they\\'re cautious about taking on the added expense of new hires.\\n\\n-- -- -- -- --\\n\\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement didn\\'t mention any spending goal but said the administration seeks to spend record levels on infrastructure.\\n\\n\"The good news here is we agreed on a big package and now it\\'s up to the president and the White House to tell us how they pay for it,\" Mr. Schumer said. \"It was repeated over and over again that unless he is willing to come up with the pay-fors for this large package, it will never get done, and he agreed.\"\\n\\nInfrastructure is the rare public policy issue that unites voters across the ideological spectrum and is certain to play into 2020 elections when Trump is seeking a second term. Yet financing -- and the possibility of tax increases -- has been a chief stumbling block for decades in efforts to build more roads, bridges and other public works.\\n\\nFinancing differences\\n\\nDemocrats favor direct government investment, while Republicans generally prefer public seed money to leverage private capital. Mr. Schumer said Mr. Trump agreed that there \"has to be a very large federal share\" of investment, although he said Mr. Trump didn\\'t endorse the Democratic proposal for a plan that is 80% funded by federal dollars.\\n\\nMr. Schumer said the White House was supportive of including investments in broadband and to give preferences to American-made goods in construction.\\n\\n\"We have to invest in this country\\'s future and bring our infrastructure to a level better than it has ever been before,\\'\\' Ms. Sanders said in a statement. \"We will have another meeting in three weeks to discuss specific proposals and financing methods.\\'\\'\\n\\nMr. Trump allies earlier Tuesday downplayed what could be accomplished with Democratic lawmakers whose colleagues are investigating almost every aspect of the Mr. Trump administration, and in some cases calling for impeachment. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said at an event in California he wasn\\'t optimistic about getting an infrastructure plan done this year.\\n\\nLow priority\\n\\nMr. Trump promised in his 2016 campaign to direct unprecedented investment to infrastructure, which set him apart from most Republicans in Congress who are generally wary of expanded government spending. Although the GOP controlled both chambers of Congress for the first two years of Trump\\'s presidency, developing an infrastructure investment plan was not a priority for Republican leaders.\\n\\nThe GOP-led Congress did manage to cut taxes -- deeply for corporations, moderately for individuals -- which they said was aimed at stimulating the economy. The cuts also curtailed revenue, making it harder to increase spending on infrastructure without further adding to yearly budget deficits.\\n\\nThis tax overhaul is exactly where some Democrats, led by Mr. Schumer, would like to look for revenue. The Democratic leader from New York said Monday on the Senate floor he would prefer to roll back some of the tax cuts for the highest earners. Increasing the gas tax or a highway user fee have also been suggested as sources of revenue.\\n\\nSenate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he raised the issue of \"tax fairness\" at the White House meeting, telling Mr. Trump and other officials that middle class taxpayers shouldn\\'t pay significantly more for infrastructure after multinational corporations benefited from rate cuts in the 2017 tax law.\\n\\nMr. Wyden said Mr. Trump agreed that fairness in the tax code and economic growth can occur simultaneously, but the president didn\\'t react to his suggestion that companies should finance added infrastructure through higher taxes.\\n\\n\\'Common denominator\\'\\n\\nRepublicans have roundly rejected raising taxes to pay for infrastructure. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said before Tuesday\\'s meeting that he didn\\'t think the talks would \"go very well,\" since Democrats\\' opening bid included undoing some of the GOP changes to the tax code.\\n\\n\"A common denominator, no matter what Democrats bring up, is a tax increase,\" Mr. McCarthy told reporters Tuesday morning. \"They\\'re walking into the meeting today saying you have to change the tax cuts.\"\\n\\nMr. Mulvaney said he\\'s not interested in spending more than $1 trillion now for something that doesn\\'t get built for more than a decade, criticizing current environmental regulations that he said hold back nimble investment in public works. Speaking at the Milken Institute\\'s conference in Los Angeles, Mr. Mulvaney also said he\\'s more optimistic about a North American trade deal getting through Congress this year than a comprehensive infrastructure plan.\\n\\nDemocratic leaders said they also discussed trade with Mr. Trump in Tuesday\\'s White House meeting, as well as immigration and health care. Mr. Schumer said the demands from some House Democrats to begin impeachment proceedings and expand investigations of the Trump administration did not come up.\\n\\nThe White House statement from Ms. Sanders said both sides agreed to continue working on ways to lower prescription drug prices.\\n\\nGoogle News - Editors Picks, Legislation, Washington, Infrastructure,', 'source': {'uri': 'pionline.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Pensions & Investments'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20190430/ONLINE/190439979/AR/0/AR-190439979.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4756980', 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 0}\n",

Economists have forecast nonfarm payrolls to bounce back by 175,000 in March, after a shockingly low 20,000 last month, meaning February was just a sputter during a long stretch of job gains. Hopes for a solid number were boosted by jobless claims data, which fell to a 49-year low last week. Also being eyed are average hourly wages, which likely rose 0.3%, and an unemployment rate that\\'s expected to hold steady at 3.8%.\\n\\nTrade progress pushes futures higher\\n\\nU.S. stock index futures are ahead by 0.2%, while Shanghai closed up 0.9% overnight, as investors cheered developments in U.S.-China trade talks. On Thursday, President Trump said that swift progress had been made, adding \"we\\'ll know over the next four weeks\" whether a deal can be reached. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, meanwhile, said a new consensus had been reached by both countries on the text of a trade agreement, according to official state news agency Xinhua.\\n\\nBorder open for now but tariffs loom\\n\\nBacking away from a threat to immediately shut the southern border, President Trump instead outlined a 25% tariff on cars as a possible tool he could use to force Mexico to halt illegal immigration and drugs. \"We\\'re going to give them a one-year warning,\" he told reporters. Asked if his comments suggested the border will remain open for at least a year, Trump responded: \"No, I didn\\'t say that... We would start with the tariffs and we\\'ll see what happens.\"\\n\\nBoeing admits MCAS played role in 737 Max crashes\\n\\n\"With the release of the preliminary report of the Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 accident investigation it\\'s apparent that in both flights the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS, activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information,\" Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. However, an update will \"add additional layers of protection and will prevent erroneous data from causing MCAS activation. Flight crews will always have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane.\"\\n\\nU.K. asks for short Brexit delay; EU suggests longer one\\n\\nA flurry of Brexit news is in the making as both the EU and the U.K. move to lengthen the current timetable for negotiations. First, European Council President Donald Tusk proposed allowing the U.K. a 12-month \"flexible\" extension to leave the EU, according to the BBC. Later this morning, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May asked the EU for another short extension to June 30, which could be terminated early if a deal is agreed to by the two sides.\\n\\nSamsung earnings are going to be ugly\\n\\nWeighed down by fading memory chip demand and rising smartphone competition, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) expects to post a 60% decline in Q1 operating profit. A figure of 6.2T South Korean won ($5.5B) would put it on track for its weakest quarterly profit since late 2016, when the firm issued a costly global recall of Galaxy Note 7 handsets that overheated. Samsung reports final results later this month.\\n\\nJeff Bezos keeps control of Amazon in divorce settlement\\n\\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos will retain voting control of his entire $143B stake in the company under a divorce settlement with his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, who will own 25% of those shares. That\\'s unless she donates them to a nonprofit or sells them in the open market. Jeff Bezos is seen as essential to Amazon\\'s meteoric growth and stock price rise since he founded the company as an online bookseller in 1994.\\n\\nSnap dives into mobile gaming space\\n\\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) announced a new ad-supported gaming platform at its Partner Summit on Thursday, following recent moves into the market by other tech companies. However, the company\\'s business model - called Snap Games - stands in contrast to Apple\\'s (NASDAQ:AAPL), which will be based on a subscription. Players will be able to jump into games directly from Snapchat, and the offering will include monetization opportunities for Snap and its partners.\\n\\nJudge punts ruling on Musk vs. SEC\\n\\nIt was an anti-climactic end in a Manhattan courtroom where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk faced off again with the SEC over his tweeting and contempt of court charges. \"My call to action is for everyone to take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on and work this out,\" Judge Nathan told both parties, instructing them to come back in two weeks with a resolution. The hearing appeared to lift an overhang over Tesla, as the SEC stopped well short of recommending Musk\\'s removal as CEO or even from the EV maker\\'s board.\\n\\nGhosn behind bars for at least 10 days\\n\\nCarlos Ghosn will be held in jail until at least April 14 without possibility of bail, according to a Tokyo court.

Sir, you may begin.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nThank you very much, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, on this beautiful spring day in Salt Lake City. Thank you for taking the time to join us. And we have, I think an exciting report and some good information about the Company. We'll start out by having Brian Lloyd, our Chief Legal Officer read our Safe Harbor provision. Brian?\\n\\nBrian Lloyd\\n\\nThank you, Fred. During our discussion today, reference may be made to projections, anticipated events, or other information, which is not purely historical. Please be aware that statements made in this call, which are not purely historical, may be considered forward-looking statements. We caution you that all forward-looking statements involve risks, unanticipated events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.\\n\\nMany of these risks are discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our Web site. Some of these risks are identified in our press release and slide presentation distributed in connection with this call.\\n\\nAny forward-looking statements made in this call are made only as of today's date and except as required by law or regulation, we do not assume any obligation to update any such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Please refer to the section of our presentation entitled disclosure regarding forward-looking statements for important information regarding such statements.\\n\\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles, which are generally accepted in the United States. However, we believe certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations, and can be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. The tables included in our release and discussed on this call set forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial statements.\\n\\nPlease refer to the sections of our presentation entitled non-GAAP financial measures and notes to non-GAAP financial measures for important information regarding non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Readers should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some items that affect net income. Finally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nBrian, thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for joining us. And as a reminder, you can go to our Web site where we have our slide deck in the Investors Section to follow along and to have some backup for our comments on the business today.\\n\\nLet me give you a general overview of the business and the first quarter. A reminder that as we have historically guided in the first part of the year we have a lot of expense; we have our sales meetings in Europe, in the United States and the Asia; we also have our incentive programs for our top producers; and so we usually see a higher amount of expense in that first quarter, which we have all accounted for.\\n\\nI think as you look at the business, you will see that we are on the top side. And the first thing I'd like to discuss is our core growth. I think it's a significant issue and opportunity. You will recall that as we look forward to '19 and to 2020, we had moved up our core growth. And I'm pleased that we were on the top side of that, particularly in the first quarter. And so I'm very pleased with those results overall.\\n\\nI'm going to give you a little bit more color on our -- on my comments, I'd like to talk about a few things. I'd like to start out by talking about the core growth, the fact that the business is strong and the pipeline is full. And I would say our business continues to be very robust. Something I want to point out that we've been asked and we are often asked, and I'm sure I'll be asked again after when we get to the Q&A, about Terumo. Raul and I have done a lot of work. In fact, I won't take any credit for it. Raul has done a lot of work in taking a look at the numbers on our products that we sell. And I think you are going to find these quite intriguing, because you all know that Terumo is back in the market.\\n\\nWell, it's hard for us to assess and we do this for living every day, the extent, the areas, the shortcomings and so on and so forth. But what I do want to point out to you, on a reported basis, when we take a look at sales of the products that we believe that we compete with, which are guide wires, our micro catheters, our hydrophilic and diagnostic catheters, some of our sheets and so on and so forth. We find that if you look at those numbers over the year ago quarter, now this is for the first quarter.\\n\\nOur reported growth of both product lines is up 44%. That does not include the Prelude Ideal which is a new product, which is Merit's fastest growing product in years that's been introduced, and that would be on top of that. But if you look at that, I think it speaks to the opportunity that we have spelled out and we have pointed out before about the fact that the momentum in the business and the fact that Merit has a broad product line to compete with anybody in this area. But I think this one speaks volumes as to where the momentum and this is in the first quarter.\\n\\nThe other thing I'd like to talk about, and add a little more color to, is Brexit. As many of you know, Brexit came up to a deadline and that has been extended and that's all well and fine. We were ready in any event. So had it been at the end of March, Merit was ready for it. But we are in full operation in our facilities in Europe and in Great Britain. And so, that's something that we're already prepared for regardless of what happens. But it does bring up I think another issue and one that's been raised by a number of investors, and that is what happens if we get to a single payor system? Well, this is a lot of speculation. And we have dealt with over the years the what-ifs and all the things that people can imagine.\\n\\nI want to remind everybody that almost 50% of Merit's business comes from international markets. Many of those markets, if not all of them, have what we would call single payor systems in Great Britain. And yet, if we look at Europe today, we'll find it's the fastest growing along with China and other areas sections of our business. So the argument is well you might get lower prices there. But again, if we look at our business, we find that there's quite a bit of ability to distinguish your products, bundle your products. And when you have a full capability of products and you have the distribution that takes care of issues like Brexit, it spells out an opportunity, not something that I think takes away from the business.\\n\\nTo move on, let's talk about Becton Dickinson. We are coming down the road on the Becton Dickinson transaction in terms of moving the facilities. We are now producing some products in our facility in Mexico. And I will say that we've invested heavily in new equipment, in training and in transfer. And remember, we were moving six -- products from six different facilities. Our guys have done a great job. In addition, Merit will be introducing before the end of the year, new products that Merit has developed that will enhance and complement the existing product lines in Tijuana as part of our biopsy product line.\\n\\nAnd then finally, in Cianna, I want to talk about that. Listen, we are performing slightly ahead of our expectations. And again, in the first quarter when you can do that, I think it bodes well for the balance of the year. So we're excited about Cianna. We continue to believe it's a great opportunity and the fact that we are in fact through the transition period. By that I mean we are shipping inventory out of Salt Lake City and out of Richmond. We're doing all the billing. We've maintained a sales force. We've essentially had no fallout other than we've had a couple of situations where there were a couple of issues or things that we had to make some changes. But our goal to maintain the sales force, maintain the R&D and develop new products out of Cianna, I think is moving along. So all-in-all, I would say that the first quarter met and exceeded our expectations. And we expected that's a good foundation for growth for the balance of the year.\\n\\nNow with that said, I'm going to turn some time over to Raul Parra, our CFO. And Raul, I'll let you go through the numbers and massage those a bit.\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nSure, thank you, Fred. So we'll start with revenue for the first quarter. It was approximately $238 million as reported, a 17% increase over the comparable period of 2018 and approximately 10% on an organic constant currency basis. Acquired products contributed revenue of $20 million, of which Cianna was $12.8 million of that and we had excess headwinds of approximately $5 million. With most of our divisions contributing for the quarter, we have strong sales in standalone product, catheters and CRM.\\n\\nOur gross margin on a GAAP basis for the quarter was 43.9% compared to 43.4%, a 50 basis point improvement for the comparable period. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 49.2% compared to 47.5% for the comparable period, a 170 basis point improvement. We picked up 30 basis points of our 165 basis point to 240 basis point improvement. We are looking for, from our 2018 full year baseline of 48.9%, pretty strong start there.\\n\\nOpEx Q1 2019, total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis were approximately 37%, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. And that's we guided that higher expenses, Fred mentioned it in his opening statement, sales meetings and shows and it's a heavy operating expense quarter for us. Our tax rate on a GAAP basis for the quarter was 10% and 17% compared to the 17% for the prior period.\\n\\nTax rate on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter was 21% compared to 23%. And we continue to benefit from stock option exercise and the tax reform. EPS, GAAP earnings were $0.11 compared to $0.10 for the comparable period. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.37 for Q1 compared to $0.31 for the comparable period, a 19% increase over the same period. A few other items of interest for everyone; debt balance was $384 million; a leverage ratio of 2.2 on a gross basis and 1.97 on a net basis; we paid our debt down by $11 million; working capital was 243 million; CapEx for the quarter came in at $18.3 million; D&A of approximately $22.4 million; and stock comp expense of $1.8 million. So overall, we have three quarters left but I think we're off to a good start. Fred?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nWell, Raul, thank you very much. Listen, I know there are other calls going on today. I think that gives you the core of what we wanted to talk about. We continue to be enthused about the business and the opportunities. As I mentioned, the pipeline is full. We've recently received a number of regulatory approvals. We don't generally talk about those and I won't go into those specifically. But the business is poised to I think respond and to take advantage of the marketplace and the opportunities.\\n\\nSo with that said, I think that pretty well covers it. So we'll get to the questions and try to keep this at a minimum, but the lines will be open. And as a reminder that after this call and the questions for clarification, Raul and I will be around for an hour or two to answer questions that you may have and to clarify points for you.\\n\\nThat being said and with that being done, we'd going to turn the time back over to our administrator. And we'll start answering your questions to the best of our ability. Thank you again for attending.\\n\\nThank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jim Sidoti of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.\\n\\nJim Sidoti\\n\\nFred, when you were talking about products that compete against Terumo being up 44%, you said that excluded the Prelude Ideal, I think. Can you give us a little more color on how that process product, Prelude Ideal is doing?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nJim, it's been one of the most successful products we've done in years. I was looking at some numbers earlier today. Again, it was a product that we just launched last year in March of '18. And in that month, we did $57,000 worth of revenue. For the month of March this year, we did $570,000 in revenue. And the reason it's so successful is that we're selling in Japan. We recently got approval in Japan. It's in U.S., Canada, Australia. And this is this metal reinforced seat for radio procedures. So Jim, when you do these R&D projects, it's nice when you have one like this they don't come along very often. But to be able to essentially pick up about a 10% market share in your first year is I think extraordinary. And we just have a lot of high hopes for this product line as we go forward.\\n\\nJim Sidoti\\n\\nAnd my second question has to do the deal announced last week, Medline acquiring Namic, there's positives and negatives to that. So I think Medline might have been a customer of yours. Can you give us some sense on how you think this all plays out?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nWell, first of all, Medline is one of our customers as well. We've worked with Cardinal and Medline and Avid, Owens & Minor through distribution where hospitals require agreements, and Merit provide certain parts of kits for standalone products, so that's ongoing. I would generally say this that first of all, I think it's interesting to know, Jim, that when we started this company, it was to emulate Namic, they have great products. But whenever you have disruption and you have a product moving from a non-competitor to a competitor. And by that I mean you've got it moving out of angio-dynamics and into a company that competes with several other companies in that distribution and in that front line manufacturing. It creates opportunities both on the national accounts level, and that's sort of thing.\\n\\nI can tell you that there are a number of conversations going on as people try to figure this whole thing out. The net of it all, Jim, is that I believe that it's a net plus-plus to Merit. And of course now all this has to -- you've got first of all, this deal sitting out here, it's going to take several months for it to close. But we view it as a big opportunity for the Company, not just in the U.S. but globally, because no one really knows what's going to happen with all of those relationships. And it creates doubt whenever you have doubts, and you have disruption if there's opportunity there. So, I think that's way for me to answer your question. Raul, do you have a different -- do you have any other thoughts on that?\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nNo...\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nOkay, all right. Okay, Jim, go ahead please.\\n\\nJim Sidoti\\n\\nAnd then the last from me, you didn't make any comments regarding your guidance you gave for '19 and '20. So I assume based on your results that everything you were thinking three months ago was pretty much intact?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nYes, I mean I think our business is -- I don't see that anything has changed. I think that there are a number -- if I were to -- again let me restate that. No, I do think that there have been some positives that are over and above some of the things that we talked about. There are always headwinds. But I think there are more tailwinds. We're feeling a breeze to our back. And I'll just leave at that, Jim, without going into any detail. But I think I would be more positive about our business, just looking at today from what I did just because of some recent developments and opportunities.\\n\\nJim Sidoti\\n\\nI think historically you've always maintained outlook after the first quarter that takes you at least to the back half of the year before you make any changes. So I assume that -- I mean, expecting to make any changes this afternoon?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nNo, we wouldn't do that, especially as you pointed out as we went and expanded these years and that core growth, I think it's prudent for us to watch this next quarter. It will then be ending the summer quarter. But based on what we see and how we feel about the business in our optimism, we will play it by the year and we'll see where we are in another 90 days or so.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\n\\nAdam Maeder\\n\\nIt's Adam Maeder on for Larry, thanks for getting the questions. I wanted to start with one on the top line and ask about the cadence of growth for the remainder of the year. You did 10% organic in Q1 to hit your full year guidance of 8% to 10% implied high single-digit growth in the second half the year against more challenging prior year comps. So what gives you the confidence in achieving that level of growth in the back half? And then I had a follow-up.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nI think its new products. I think it's the momentum of products like the Ideal, the Sync, which is the closure device. I think a number of new products that are in the pipeline. Some of which you can see on our website. I think it's generally -- I was talking to a sales person yesterday, you can talk about -- I don't know that there is any better information than information you get from your sales force. I was talking to one of our sales people yesterday in California they were talking about new account. In fact, I'd called them, because I noticed that they opened new account, and I was happy with the results. And as I talked to them, they started talking me about these other evaluations and things that have passed the back committees.\\n\\nAnd you start to get a sense about how things are going, what the momentum is, people that are obtaining to meet the leadership clause. And you start to feel the momentum of the business, you start to see things. So I mean a lot of -- of course its numbers, but it's really attitude that drives numbers. And I talked to two or three, or four of our sales people every day. Just when I see something that they do, I call them and thank them. So it's really just feel of the momentum. When you go to a basketball game like the Utah Jazz when they're playing the Houston Rockets last night, you can see with that momentum and it wasn't going to weigh and it didn't and we beat it by 16 points. Please don't remind me that we have to go to Houston on Wednesday. So that's the answer to your question, momentum watching the activity and listening to the sales force is like anything else in sports, or anything like it's just a game and it's all about attitude momentum.\\n\\nAdam Maeder\\n\\nAnd then Fred as a follow-up, you talked publicly about a competitor device going out patent in mid-May in the U.S. I think you said that's in the insulation devices space, anymore details you can share. What's the magnitude of the opportunity from a revenue standpoint? And what's embedded in the guidance for this potential opportunity, should we be thinking about this purely as upside? Just trying to understand how you are thinking about things. Thanks for taking the questions guys.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nWell, let me just put it this way that we have a product that we'll launch on or about 19th of May, so we're less than a month away. We have been selling the product with great success at the international market for the last three years, sold hundreds of thousands of units. It comes off patents and we can combine it with a number of our products. That's really what I'm going to limit it now. But I will say that, it's first time to think, we put in our forecaster and I'm looking around them, it is not in our forecast.\\n\\nSo, it is upside. And as I can tell you, there's a high gross margin products well above our corporate average, and something that we think is going to be a great advantage to us. But again, we'll let it play out and you'll see a shortened numbers, you see a little bit in the second quarter, you start and you'll start to see it ramp from there throughout the year. And once that day can pass, we'll talk about it openly or in our next call. But until that time, we're going to keep it kind of limited to what I have talked about in these comments.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\\n\\nDavid Rescott\\n\\nIt is David on for Jason. Can you hear me alright?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nThat's fine.\\n\\nDavid Rescott\\n\\nFirst on Cianna, coming in stronger than expected. Could you provide some color around kind of the rollout so far? And was there other any kind of one timer or is there big customers that contributed the growth in the quarter? And then kind of how you sink the impact or how you think kind of growth would be on the top line and gross margin contribution given the growth in the quarter?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nYes, well, first of all, I think with Cianna, there's a couple of things I think they're important. We -- as you recall, we did not -- we maintained their sales force and we think that was a critical thing to do. We also didn't try to go out and one fell swoop and then throw it all into our Merit sales force. We thought get out there, have enough time to absorb it, to understand it, build the confidence of the former Cianna now Merit, sales force.\\n\\nAnd yet with all of that, and through the transition, and through all of those things that go on in those in these situations, we were able to come slightly above where we had expected. So I think there's a lot of momentum there. There were no large single customers or anything like that. It was just little guts hardball, selling and executing. So, I mean, I think that's probably the best, but I guess the bottom line is. It is probably a good of a transaction and transition that we have done. I think maybe the best one. I mean, we've done a lot of small deals.\\n\\nBut I think that speaks volumes to Joe Anderson and her team and just the way that our team has worked. We kept all the R&D people, we kept the sales people, we've done I think, if they fit into the family actually quite easily. I've been down there several times. I'm getting hit down there again soon.\\n\\nSo I think all in all, it was a transaction and a business that I don't know how you could do it any better. To be honest with you, I think we've done it well, and then we have new products and we have new projects underway. So, we're very excited about Cianna and what it means.\\n\\nDavid Rescott\\n\\nThanks and moving to the balance sheet or cash flow. Could you provide any detail on kind of what free cash flow generation was in the quarter and kind of how that looks to the rest of the year? I know, it looks like your net operating cycle kind of links into bit within the quarter and wondering, if there are any one time occurrence and that led to this? And more or less in general kind of what initiatives you really have planned to kind of improve cash conversion going forward to the rest of the year?\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nYes, so free cash flow was negative $4.8 million. We had some building closing in Maastricht. We had some -- our building across the street here in South Jordan, we had some equipment down in Mexico for the BD stuff. So, it was expected and it was budgeted. We did give guidance on CapEx in the summer in the 60 to 65 range. So, we are working on free cash flow, something we're paying attention to.\\n\\nThe problem that we run into is, if we step back a little bit, if you look where our growth is coming from. I guess maybe just breaking free cash flow up and you think that some of the big drivers, specifically around working capital. You've got AP, AR and inventory. So accounts payable, obviously, we could go out and try to negotiate longer term with our customers. If you do that, they're going to ask for typically a higher cost because you're financing the inventory.\\n\\nWell, that hurts us in the gross margin. So, we don't really want to do that. We've got to really play it safe there. On the receivable side, our growth is coming from the U.S. They have longer terms out there. That's just historically what's going on there? That's the cost of doing business in Europe. So trying to manage that is hard also.\\n\\nInventory, I think we can make some, we can make a little bit, we can improve that a little bit and we've got a new inventory policy that we're working on and we're trying to improve that. So I think there's a little bit we can do. We are keeping an eye on the free cash flow. We know it's important to people, but we've got, we're long term planners and so to kind of turn on a dime, when it's an area of increased focus it's hard for us specifically given the planning that we've done.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nAnd I think a couple other things, let me just add some more color, as Raul addressed it a bit, but we've discussed this. We have a new 135,000 square foot facility that's under construction in Salt Lake City. And growth has its cost and a lot of benefits, but you have to invest to have to capacity into the future. As we look down the road, we've talked about this about what we look as our growth this year and next year, but we look well beyond that.\\n\\nAnd as we look at those things we say these are the capacity issues. That also includes Richmond, where we are now. I think the number was thrown out to me today that somewhere around 50% or 60% of our shipments, run, I hope I'm right on this one, but are now being shipped out of Richmond. So, we've had to put more capacity there to have better service to our customers on the East Coast.\\n\\nWe have a facility the same issue in the Netherlands in Maastricht. So, as you can say, we're investing our money in capacity, and in really customer service and leading it to that level. But again, I think we're comfortable with what we said beginning of the year, what we think we'll generate in terms of free cash flow and where we are on CapEx. I don't think anything has changed there. So, we're on task for those commitments we've made early in the year.\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nAnd I will point out that we did have $11 million pay down on debt. So, I mean, we're working on that.\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your question please.\\n\\nJayson Bedford\\n\\nI'll keep it to two. You've mentioned the new MDR initiatives in Europe and the fact that could have impacted. So, that's impacting product approvals in Europe. You mentioned slightly scattered. Are there any other products that have been perhaps delayed from a regulatory standpoint in Europe?\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nYes, well, I think, listen, if you take a look Jayson at the whole environment over there. Right now, you've got the Brexit, you've got MDR, and then you've got -- the MDR consolidation, I'll call it, notified bodies. I mean, they're just simply are not the number of bodies. And by the way, I actually believe in the long run that that's actually better for the industry. But in the meantime and so everybody catch up whether it'd be our notified body or the other ones that are there.\\n\\nIncidentally, someone told me and again I think this is correct, but somewhere around 80% of all the products that go into Europe, go through a notified body in Great Britain. We start to think about what that means and especially with all this Brexit stuff, it is slowed all of that stuff down. So, I don't believe that there is anything there that will affect our goals and our forecast.\\n\\nI think that it's just frustrating sometimes as when you have just the delay and even lack of communication. So, it's -- all of a sudden, the FDA has become our sweetheart because they'll talk to us so we can get things done. And the United States very candidly has become the area of preference. So, we will now in many of things go to the U.S. first, we're pretty listening we'll be go to the with CE market first of all, so I think that's flip-flop, but nothing that will affect our overall performance as a company.\\n\\nJayson Bedford\\n\\nAnd then on the cost side, SG&A was a bit higher than we expected and perhaps we miss model that line item. But is there any way to quantify the costs that are unique to SG&A here in this first quarter? I realized you've mentioned, sales meetings, I imagined bring together Cianna is also an increased cost. So I'm just wondering, is there any way to kind of quantify the impact in the first quarter there?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nI'm going to let Raul give an answer to that. I mean I think while they're looking and I think some people point some numbers, they're having conversation. Let me just say that that you are right, but we also have the vascular insights, so that is the Clarivein as part of that. You have the training for a number of other new products. You had -- a very candidly, we had our President's Club.\\n\\nYou have -- and we did, that's not just in Europe, but we did it in U.S. we did it in Asia. It's something that you can look forward to every year because we try to get those things done and out of the way, so we can get about business. So do you have any quality, I mean, do you want to put anything to that in terms of...\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nYes, it was about $2 million or $3 million just kind of those expenses.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nOkay. So, it's about $2 million or $3 million of addition expense in that first quarter or I think we were at 37, we reduce it'd like to be somewhere around the 35% range of expenses, so a couple hundred basis points.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\\n\\nMatthew O'Brien\\n\\nJust a quick clarification one, Fred, upfront. Are you saying that SCOUT is going to be delayed a little bit in Europe pass the Q2 timeframe that you provided earlier this year?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nNo, I'm not saying that. I'm just, you know, we're not expecting that. We expect that it'll be in the second quarter or so.\\n\\nMatthew O'Brien\\n\\nAnd then, Raul, just on the gross margin side, big step up here in Q1 great to see. But I think for the rest of the year in order to get to the midpoint of the range, you have to average about 51.6% on the gross margin line to get to the midpoint of range that you provided. So, first of all, are you comfortable with that? And then, if so, can you just give us a sense of where some of that improvement comes from here in the last three quarters?\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nYes, I think, if you look at the cadence that we had last year, Matt. I think it's going to follow a similar path. We expect pretty strong gross margin improvement in Q2 and Q3, and then typically, we tend to kind of level off a little bit in Q4 or to be slightly better. So, I think we feel comfortable with it and we'll see a need to adjust that.\\n\\nMatthew O'Brien\\n\\nAnd then last one from me. And Fred, I love asking you about the products and previous products, but I haven't heard much on the PAE side in the last few quarters. So just hope you give an update there? And then also same question goes for WRAPSODY and how the development of our product proceeding?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nLet me go to PAE, it's always a really hard one. You'll recall Matt that, when you look PAE, you really use small amounts of embolics, you'll use may be one vial where the UFP would average somewhere between 3 and 5 maybe we'd say 4. So, there is a big difference in terms of utilization there for PAE.\\n\\nThe other thing is that, you see on a number of products and PAE and I think as we were going and talking a little bit earlier about the products to compete with Terumo. And we say this, we look at that area that area was up 44% on constant currency. Those products, many of those like the ninja, the radial approach to that wires, the hydrophilic, many of those the same products that feed into PAE.\\n\\nSo, it's always hard because just nature of the procedure and how it's broken down. But we are still doing training classes on it, we got back from sure that still I think in area that interventional radiologists feel like they can compete that they have a unique skill set that others can't interfere with because of their knowledge of imaging. So, I think that it still high on our priority just to make we have more classes come up. Do you want to comment on that?\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nSure. I think, Fred, you've pretty much let it out. I would point the key products like SwiftNINJA in the United States I think grew an excess of 30%. The accessories and the pair procedural products used in the PAE procedure continued to be a significant growth factor for us, but it's an area I think had continued developments. As Fred mentioned, the interventional radiologist continued to put heavy focus on it. And as such, we continued to address it with not only our embolic products but all the other products that are experiencing substantial and significant growth.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nSo, I don't think you should read into a lack of optimization. I think we try to hit point like acquisitions you're making through Becton Dickinson and those sorts of things. Now, let me come to the WRAPSODY, we are doing a study on in Europe and we now I think have done, I think it's close to 10 patients give or take and our plan is to do 30. We should be bringing on two more locations, one in Scotland and one in Greece, and we believe that those two will be on -- we still believe and I'm looking over my regulatory officer, but I believe. John, do you still believe that we are going to be wrap up that safety study by let's say June or by July.\\n\\nJohn Hall\\n\\nGive or take, let's say maybe a little longer than that.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nOkay. Though I mean, we believe that sometime in the second early, third quarter will have that safety study, we'll then take a look at filing IDE in the United States and that process will start. So, I think the good news is that, all of those cases have been very successful. In the comments, I get positions as well. I will start and I will change over to use this because of some of its features and benefits and deployment over other products.\\n\\nSo, again, those numbers are also as we look at that, none of that is in our forecast of course. We only forecast products that have been launched. And all these other things and what we see and what gave us confidence is, we look down the road when we gave our '19 and our '20 year full year guidance.\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Matson of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\\n\\nDavid Saxon\\n\\nHi, Fred and Raul, it's David Saxon on for Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I'll start with one on Cianna. Just wondering, if there are any opportunities to either develop or acquire additional products for those reps to sell?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nYes, I mean, I think the answer is, yes. Going to a comment that we make quite regularly that there's no less than five different opportunities on the table at any given time, and probably another five in the queue opportunities. We believe that the healthcare market is so consolidating. We like women's health, we like a lot. I personally, as I think I've mentioned previously have been in a number of cases. There's a big meeting coming up in Dallas in a couple of weeks. I'll be there. So, we still believe this is an area of a lot of interest to our company. And very candidly, I think an area that needs to have interest. I think there is a lot of room for improvement and a lot of opportunity in women's health.\\n\\nDavid Saxon\\n\\nAnd how's the business in China performing? And can you talk about your strategy in other emerging markets, like Southeast Asia and Latin America?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nWell, I thought no one would ever ask. You know, if you will recall that maybe six months ago when all of the political rhetoric was filing going past and forward that, that's all anybody can talk about, if you have exposure. Our business continues to grow at 20% or better, at a higher level in Southeast Asia, particularly as we look at Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand. Joe Wright, you're in the room with me, he oversees all that. Joe, would you like to comment?\\n\\nJoe Wright\\n\\nYes, the business continues to be very strong in China. We continue to get solid penetration in interventional radiology as we're busy expanding into the Southeast Asian countries.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nYes. So, the expansion plans are online. We're seeing really nice improvements, particularly products like the ideal in Canada, Zealand and in Australia. So I mean, our business plan we're much more aggressive and interesting enough, something that a country that no one talks about, other than in news and as it pertains to immigration issues in Mexico. So, we've opened up over the process of opening our first sales office in Mexico City. So, we think that there's a lot of opportunity there. And Joe overseas, Central and South America as well and we continue to see growth.\\n\\nSo, I mean, I don't want anybody to be bored. But it's, you know, someone said to me, well, the thing about you guys is just like, tick, tick, tick, tick it's just kind of like doing things all the time and the answers, we're just executing our business plans. I do believe and I said it maybe a couple of times on this call today that there were a couple of things out there. I'm feeling a very nice breeze at my back and I do believe that there are some things out that they could put that into maybe a 10 to 15 knot wind.\\n\\nThat's not meant to mean 10% to 15% or any other type of growth numbers. I want to clarify that because I want to make sure as soon as I said that, actually said that, but is that what I mean by that is I'm feeling not a breeze, but I believe that breeze is going to get a little bit stronger and I'm starting to feel it. Raul, do you want to add to that?\\n\\nRaul Parra\\n\\nI think you would say very robust and I would say robust.\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nOkay, yes. Okay, there you go. Raul says robust and I say very robust. Be careful of what Raul says, if he says very robust sometime that I'm going to start to worry about it, but the business is very robust.\\n\\nOur next question comes from Bruce Nudell of SunTrust Robinson. Your question please.\\n\\nStan Fediuk\\n\\nThis is Stan Fediuk line for Bruce Nudell. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one on your Catheter segment, came in better than we expected. I was just wondering, if there any one-time items embedded in the quarter?\\n\\nFred Lampropoulos\\n\\nI'm looking at, at Raul and then I am Justin and Joe, and we don't see any one-time events there. Just kind of that part of that breeze I was talking about.\\n\\nThank you.

After the completion of the call, a recording of the call will be made available on the same site.\\n\\nI would now like to the conference over to Rebecca Gardy, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at GreenSky. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRebecca Gardy\\n\\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, GreenSky issued a press release announcing results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2019. You can access this press release on the Investor Relations site of the GreenSky website.\\n\\nJoining me on the call today are David Zalik, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gerry Benjamin, Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer; and Rob Partlow, Chief Financial Officer.\\n\\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that our presentation and discussions today will include forward-looking statements. These are statements that are based on current assumptions and are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Information about these risks and uncertainties are included in our press release issued this morning as well as in our filings with regulators.\\n\\nWe will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results, and we encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing GreenSky's performance. These non-GAAP measures are described and reconciled to their GAAP counterparts in the presentation materials, the press release dated May 7, 2019 and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\\n\\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And finally, a replay of this call will be available later today on our website at greensky.com.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will now turn it over to David.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nThank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report that GreenSky's first quarter played out materially consistent with our seasonally adjusted plan with both operating results and new merchant additions in line with expectations with momentum continuing very nicely into the second quarter.\\n\\nI'd like to start off this morning by providing a brief overview of our Q1 2019 performance and then share a few key takeaways from our recently held GreenSky Merchant Council Meeting before turning it over to Gerry to discuss our key operating metrics and then to Rob to review our financial results in greater detail.\\n\\nYou will see on Slide 4 that we reported a 20% year-over-year growth in transaction volume in the first quarter to $1.24 billion. Ex solar originations, transaction volumes grew 27%. This growth was aided by strong and growing demand in our elective healthcare vertical, which now represents approximately 10% of total monthly transaction volume. Importantly, Q1 origination volume was materially consistent with management guidance previously provided of 19% 2019 full year origination guidance at the midpoint.\\n\\nOn Slide 8, you will see that in 2018, GreenSky enjoyed its most productive annual cohort of new merchant additions, setting the company up nicely for strong growth in 2019 and the years to come. This is an important continuation of a four-year trend of record annual merchant cohort growth.\\n\\nGreenSky reported Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $18.7 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18%. Recall that Q1 each year reflects GreenSky's lowest revenue quarter, while at the same time, Q1 is burdened by elevated public company costs as well as accrual of annual sponsor volume-driven rebates. Rob will cover additional details surrounding our Q1 operating results. So let me now transition to the key takeaways from our GreenSky Merchant Council Meeting.\\n\\nDuring the last weekend in March, we hosted our first GreenSky Merchant Council Meeting, which provided our senior management team extended one-on-one time with a number of our largest merchants and sponsors. As I reflect on what our team heard during this inaugural event, there were six key takeaways shared by virtually every merchant in attendance: One, the fundamental demand for home improvement projects continues to be very strong. No merchant we met with reported seeing any softening in demand associated with variability of reported housing starts; two, project backlogs and merchants qualified leads going into 2019 reflect a continuation of the healthy pace of new project starts experienced in 2018, suggesting that 2019 will be another record year in terms of dollar volume of home improvement projects completed; three, the lead times to mobilize crews and kickoff jobs continue to extend throughout the back half of 2018 as the shortage of skilled labor impacted all our merchants nationwide; four, GreenSky's instantaneous paperless digital financing tools are playing an ever increasing role in enabling merchants to close more projects at higher unit prices per job; five, our merchants believe that the distance between GreenSky and our leading competitors in terms of our technology and tools continues to widen; six, the more that GreenSky can do to enhance our proprietary merchant technology platform with additional tools such as digital coating, CRM, sales and marketing, universal applications, the greater the level of merchant account penetration to be achieved.\\n\\nAs I shared in our prior quarter's earnings release, the current GreenSky technology road map is incredibly robust and we're excited about the products we'll be releasing in the coming quarters informed in no small measure by the direct input we received from our merchants. I'll now turn it over to Gerry to provide an update on key operational metrics.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nThank you, David, and good morning. As a financial technology company, GreenSky is dedicated to driving the future of payments and advancing the way commerce is conducted. This year, we're highly focused on two key initiatives; advancing our technology offerings and deepening our market penetration. Our proprietary technology platform is a key differentiator for GreenSky and we're continuing to innovate on exciting value-added feature functionalities for all members of the GreenSky ecosystem.\\n\\nGreenSky operates within a very large addressable market with our mobile, online and in-store point-of-sale finance technology. We have tremendous runway to grow our market share within our existing industry verticals of home improvement and elective healthcare. Concurrent with growing our presence in these two verticals, we're leveraging our playbook to selectively enter new verticals, including specialty retail and e-commerce. You'll see on Slide 6 of the investor deck that as of March 31, we had 15, 745 active merchants on our platform, an increase of 29% compared to last year.\\n\\nOur merchant base includes small owner-operated home improvement contractors and elective healthcare providers as well as large national home improvement and health care service organizations. Our merchants are leveraging the GreenSky platform to provide their customers with financing solutions which are as important as ever in fueling the growth of their businesses. Since last reporting on representative new merchant additions during the first quarter of 2019, GreenSky has successfully onboarded four regional HVAC distributors and installers, expected to generate more than $120 million in annual finance volume, three residential roof and exterior remodeling contractors expecting to generate in excess of $100 million in annual finance volume.\\n\\nMultiple interior and external general residential remodeling contractors and multiple owner-operated franchisees of one of the largest domestic replacement window franchisor in the U.S. such franchisor expected to generate in excess of $650 million in annual system-wide retail sales. And in our elective healthcare segment, during the same period, we have brought on a 700-door national Dental Service Organization, or DSO, expected to generate in excess of $200 million of annual patient finance volume, 350 additional clinical locations offering Allergan licensed noninvasive body sculpting procedures, a large national dental practice management software sponsor integrating the GreenSky Patient Solution Platform as its primary first-look patient finance utility, a significant dental implant provider with 51 clinical locations nationwide and a myriad of general, restorative and aesthetic dental practices representing more than 200 clinical sites nationwide.\\n\\nSince the company's inception through the end of the first quarter, GreenSky has now enabled over $17 billion of transactions with over 2.4 million consumers. With financing plans that meet customer needs, merchants close more deals and win larger contracts making our platform increasingly integral to driving their business growth. Through our bank partners, highlighted on Slide 8, GreenSky facilitates loan types ranging from no payments and no interest with the purchase of balances paid during the promotional period to attractive reduced-rate installment loans.\\n\\nOur total aggregate bank partner commitments was $11.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter with $4.5 billion of unused commitments. Demand for additional GreenSky-originated assets by our existing bank partners is strong and we see continued interest by new perspective bank partners. GreenSky's proprietary technology platform is intuitive, it's paperless and it's user friendly. As David mentioned, this is a key differentiator as is our seamless integration. Merchants are increasingly using the GreenSky technology platform to improve customer experience, complete projects, while supplying our bank partners with an attractive pool of prime and superprime borrowers.\\n\\nSlides 10 and 11 reflect the average FICO score and origination of these consumers, which were exceptionally strong at a mean FICO of 769. Consumers with average FICO scores of 780 or above now comprise 36% of the loan portfolio at March 31, up sequentially from the same time last year and over 85% have FICO scores of over 700. In no case, have we relaxed credit standards in any fashion, 30-day delinquencies in Q1 2019 were 1.13% up a modest 13 basis points compared to 1.18% in Q1 2018, predictively attributable to the growth in our patient solutions servicing portfolio.\\n\\nDelinquencies in home improvement are stable and totally consistent with prior years. And finally, on Slide 11, we disclose the Origination Productivity Index, or OPI, which was 21.9% for the first quarter, substantially equivalent to the 22.2% at the end or flat to Q1 2018.\\n\\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to review our financial performance and provide an update on our 2019 full year guidance. Rob?\\n\\nRob Partlow\\n\\nThank you, Gerry. As I review the results for the first quarter during my remarks, note that all my comparisons will be relative to the first quarter of 2018 unless otherwise stated. Transaction volume increased 20% to $1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding solar originations, which were approximately $48 million lower than last year, we grew transaction volume by 27% during the first quarter. We expect year-over-year growth to accelerate for the remainder of the year as originations of our elective healthcare vertical continue to accelerate and we expand our initiatives into specialty retail and e-commerce. As we have discussed previously, origination volume follows a predictable seasonal pattern with the first and fourth quarter being weaker than the second and third quarter.\\n\\nTotal revenue grew 22% to $103.7 million in the first quarter. Transaction fees grew 18% to $84.0 million. The average transaction fee for the first quarter was 6.8% compared to 6.9% last year. As a reminder, the first quarter of every year, we apply a volume-based promotional allowance for certain sponsors, which in 2019 reduced the effective transaction fee by $3.5 million. Adjusting for that rebate, the average transaction fee was 7.05% versus 7.1% in the first quarter of 2018.\\n\\nFor the full year, we expect the transaction fee rate to be between 7.0% and 7.1%. As always, seasonal fluctuations in the mix of different promotional products offered by our merchants and providers will cause transaction fee percentage to ebb and flow throughout the year. Servicing and other revenue totaled $19.7 million, reflecting 34% growth of the loan servicing portfolio, which ended the quarter at $7.6 billion. Servicing fees represented an annualized 1.05% of the average servicing portfolio. While revenue grew 22%, our adjusted EBITDA decreased 27.5% or from $27.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $18.7 million this quarter, attributed to a combination of both timing as well as investment spending.\\n\\nTwo-thirds of the delta is associated largely with timing items related to the expected increase in the fair value trades in the FCR liability that we expect to dissipate in the following quarters, which is resulting from spread compression and margin contraction as an increase in contracted bank partner portfolio yields associated with our increase in the benchmark rates, coupled with a slight increase in credit losses attributable to the company's growing mix of health care loans, which was expected. And 1/3 of the increase was - is related to the higher expenses in both servicing origination and operating expenses, a piece of which is associated with being a public company as well as to drive our growth.\\n\\nTurning to the components of cost of revenue, we breakout on Slide 14 the components of cost of revenue into three distinct components; origination expense, service and expenses and the fair value change in the FCR liability. Origination-related expenses were $8.5 million or approximately 0.7% of originations. We expect origination expenses will trend closer towards 0.6% of transaction volume in the coming quarters as we benefit from higher transaction activity. Servicing-related expenses totaled $10.7 million or approximately 0.6% of the average loan servicing portfolio.\\n\\nWe continue to expect servicing expenses to trend towards 0.5% over the next couple of quarters as we benefit from building scale within our operations. The fair value change in the FCR liability was $38.8 million for the first quarter on annualized 2.1% of the average loan servicing portfolio. The increase of $17.3 million versus last year is a function of both the growth in the deferred interest loan products as a percentage of origination as well as an increase in the bank partner portfolio yield, which negatively impacted receipts.\\n\\nOn Slide 14, we have provided the detail of the components of the fair value change in the FCR liability. And on Slide 15, we also breakout the fair value change in the FCR liability by the drivers of this expense line. As discussed last quarter, I believe Slide 15 is a key to understanding the fair value change in the FCR liability as it lays out the two components; the expected - the expense for future finance charge reversals and receipts, which are - act as reduction to the aforementioned expense.\\n\\nI'll begin with the expense for future finance charge reversals, which is the expense related to the building up of the liability on our balance sheet for future finance charge reversals. This expense was $70.9 million during the quarter or an annualized 3.79% of the average servicing portfolio, up from $49.6 million during the first quarter of 2018 or 3.58% of the average servicing portfolio. The increase in expense is due to both the growth in deferred interest loans in the portfolio as well as the higher APR in deferred interest loans originated since mid-2018.\\n\\nAs previously noted, we expect the FCR rate to continue to increase over the remainder of the year. Given the impact of higher APRs on transactions as well as the higher mix of deferred interest loans in our elective healthcare vertical, we expect the impact of this increased FCR rate to be largely offset by increases in incentive payments, a component of receipts as the year progresses. Receipts from our servicing portfolio reduced the expense for future finance charge reversals and totaled $32.1 million or 1.72% of the servicing portfolio. The receipts percentage is down from 2.04% during the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to bank partner yields on new originations increasing on transactions during the first quarter of 2018 at a faster pace than the loan yields on new originations.\\n\\nRecall that during the third quarter, our price increases on merchant transaction fees drove the mix of loans to higher finance charge APRs and resulted in the loan rates increase in a much faster rate than bank margins. As the trend of higher loans vis-a-vis bank margins continues over the next several quarters, we expect receipts to increase on a year-over-year basis. Yet, let me pause here to emphasize an important point. As discussed last quarter, receipts are adversely impacted in the fourth quarter and first quarter by the seasonality of consumer charge-offs. And conversely, receipts benefit from the seasonality in consumer credit cycle in the second and third quarters. We expect the seasonality to positively impact receipts over the next two quarters.\\n\\nOperating expenses were $34.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 33% over last year. The increase was driven by the growth in our sales and marketing expenses, investment in our technology platform and the cost of being a public company. As you know, we had no public company cost during the first quarter of 2018. In addition, the first quarter traditionally has a higher-level of public company and other G&A expenses. Accordingly, we expect our operating expenses to decline by $2 million or $3 million next quarter. Operating profit was $11.5 million for the first quarter. And from a GAAP perspective, we had a first quarter tax benefit attributable to the exercise during the quarter of options and warrants.\\n\\nNet income was $7 million during the quarter because GAAP includes - GAAP net income includes - excludes non-controlling interest, a function of our Up-C structure, we believe pro forma net income is a useful measure of our enterprise's financial results. Pro forma net income was $6.5 million using an effective 19.25% effective tax rate, which is our estimate for the full year's effective tax rate. As we have indicated on prior earnings calls, we believe that adjusted EBITDA is one of our key financial indicators on our business performance over the long-term and provides useful information regarding whether cash provided by operating activities is sufficient to maintain and grow our business. And for the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $18.7 million.\\n\\nTurning to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $268 million of unrestricted cash, free cash flow for the first three months of 2019 was $20 million as detailed on Slide 22. We review the repurchase of our class shares - we view the repurchase of our Class A shares as an attractive use of cash given the current price and have continued to be opportunistic in such respect. During the first quarter, we repurchased $4.3 million of additional shares of Class A common stock at an incremental cost of $51 million under our $150 board approved share repurchase program. Furthermore, in April, we repurchased an additional 99,000 shares for a total cost of $1.3 million. In total, since we began the program in the third quarter of 2018, GreenSky has repurchased $9.1 million - 9.1 million shares at a cost of $96.1 million.\\n\\nTurning - quickly turning to our guidance of the full year of 2019, as we announced in our earnings press release, based on our first quarter performance and current market conditions, we are reaffirming our first - our full year 2019 guidance. This guidance includes transaction volume to increase between 27% to 35% over the fiscal 2018 to between $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion, revenue to grow between 30% and 38% over the fiscal 2018 to between $538 million and $572 million, pro forma net income to grow between 17% and 28% over fiscal 2018 to between $128 million and $140 million. And adjusted EBITDA to grow between 22% and 31% over fiscal 2018 to between $210 million and $225 million.\\n\\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rebecca to set up the Q&A.\\n\\nRebecca Gardy\\n\\nThanks, Rob. And that concludes our prepared remarks. Before we move to questions, I want to remind listeners that GreenSky is participating in two upcoming investor conferences. David Zalik will be presenting at the JPMorgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference in Boston on Wednesday, May 15th at 4:20 pm Eastern Time. Gerry Benjamin will be presenting at the Needham Emerging Technology Conference in New York on Tuesday, May 21st at 8:20 in the morning. Both presentations will be webcast and available on GreenSky's Investor Relations website.\\n\\nIn addition, the company filed its 2019 proxy statement on April 30th and announced that we will be holding our first Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Thursday, June 6th 10:00 am. The event will be virtual only and all details on how to access the call are contained in the proxy materials. And finally, GreenSky's 2018 annual report is now available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please remember, we are happy to take detailed modeling questions off-line.\\n\\nAnd with that, operator, let's please have our first question.\\n\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\\n\\nJim Schneider\\n\\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Good to see the progress in the elective healthcare vertical now at 10% of volume, I think you stated. Maybe, David, can you give us a little bit of an update on the momentum you see in that vertical? And then maybe a bit of a sense as we get through the end of 2019, how big do you think that could be as a percentage of the overall total? Thank you.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nThank you, Jim, good morning. very excited about elective healthcare. 2018 ending the year with 10% of our volume being in healthcare was a very important milestone and a goal that we were very proud to accomplish and we are set up to double that this year. I don't think I caught the second half of your question.\\n\\nJim Schneider\\n\\nJust in terms of where you expect that to be as a percentage as we exit the year? I guess it helps if you say you're going to double it this year, but...\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nJim, this is Gerry. The run rate at the end of 2018 gave us great confidence it will double the dollar amount in 2019 over 2018 and that should grow from 10% of system-wide kind of enterprise revenue to something in the mid-teens.\\n\\nJim Schneider\\n\\nGot it. That's helpful. Thanks.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nSo healthcare is going to double, but the rest of the business is growing very nicely too.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nJim Schneider\\n\\nUnderstand. Very clear. And then maybe just a question on the delinquency rate. Given what you saw in the quarter, I mean, the delinquency, I think, you said stepped up to 1.31% in the quarter. Just some rough math on my part would suggest that if it was kind of on a 10% run rate, then the delinquency rate in elective healthcare must be kind of like around 4 points or so. Is there anything else that was kind of in that number in terms of the step up in the home improvement piece of it or is that math roughly right?\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nTotally consistent with the home improvement piece.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nThat's right. Home improvement was incredibly stable, which was very encouraging to have that part of the portfolio age and the delinquency to incredibly stable within 1 basis point. So healthcare as we've discussed for years is a higher fee, higher delinquency business and it was exactly consistent with our expectations.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nYou about nailed it on the percentage basis, Jim.\\n\\nJim Schneider\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Davis with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\\n\\nJohn Davis\\n\\nHey, good morning, guys. Rob, I just wanted to touch on rates for a minute. Obviously, rates went up a lot faster than you expected last year, but now I think since you've given guidance rates do include your swap curves or swap rates are down call it 70, 75 basis points. So maybe just talk about the impact there. Has that resulted in potential upside or there are pricing changes you didn't make, just commentary on the reduction rates and that will flow to the P&L for the rest of the year?\\n\\nRob Partlow\\n\\nHey, John. Thanks for the question. As we've said for a couple of years, when rates go up, it does not reduce our margin. When rates go down, it does not improve our margin. A change of rates creates friction and a distraction for both our merchants and our sales organization. So when rates stop going up, we don't have to raise rates to our merchants, and so it's neutral to us.\\n\\nJohn Davis\\n\\nAll right. But on the bank funding side, right, you should get a benefit because those reprice every quarter. So just thinking about is there some benefit on the funding line that you won't get on the transaction take rate line this year or I think has nothing really changed? I'm just trying to understand the FCR impact of the changing rates.\\n\\nRob Partlow\\n\\nYes. So as rates go up, what we charge the merchants or the corresponding interest rate to the consumer goes up. When rates stop going up, then we stop raising rates. And so our businesses is fixed at the time of origination. So if a loan is originated in December, any subsequent rate changes won't impact the economics on that loan, either on the revenue side or the expense side.\\n\\nJohn Davis\\n\\nOkay. And then, Gerry, I just want to talk a little bit on Jim's question, just to clarify a little bit. So the $6.6 billion of originations this year at the midpoint will be an increase of about $1.6 billion. So if you're doubling the elective healthcare, that would mean a $400 million of the growth is coming from elective healthcare? I just want to know $1.2 billion would be home improvement? I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about this the right way.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nYes, we don't typically break out to that level of detail, but you're in the right zip code.\\n\\nJohn Davis\\n\\nOkay. All right. Thanks guys.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\\n\\nJason Kupferberg\\n\\nHey, great. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to start with a question about the overall outlook for the rest of the year. Completely understand the expected seasonal softness in Q1, but just talk about your visibility on the acceleration and the transaction volume during the balance of the year. I think the comps do get meaningfully more easy and certainly, you have momentum in some of the newer verticals, maybe you need to do low to mid-30s or so the remaining three quarters to kind of get solidly to the midpoint of the guide. And same question really just on the EBITDA margins. Obviously, you had a couple of known headwinds in Q4, but just your comfort level and your visibility on accelerating significantly during the balance of the year there to achieve the full year target? Thanks.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nJason, thank you. So Q1 played out in line with what we expected and hoped for, and I think that fundamentally, seeing a solid Q1 and also seeing an excellent April gives us a lot of confidence going into the next eight months. Though having four months anchor the year is a very telling insight, certainly into volume, which is the biggest driver of our business. Seeing stable dynamics in pay grade certainly makes forecasting a lot less complicated and volatile. So that's good. And so we reaffirmed our guidance because we felt good about first quarter. We felt very good about terrific acceleration of growth in April. And so that gives us a lot of confidence going into the rest of the year. We're also seeing on a more granular level, excellent cohort growth. The 2018 cohort that we signed up in 2018 did more business in 2018 than any other year won cohort business. It's certainly off to a great start this year.\\n\\nThe 2019 Q1 cohort is the biggest Q1 cohort we've ever had. So everything is showing really good positive momentum that we are looking at on the volume side. And the EBITDA margin was exactly as we expected and we've seen year after year after year, Q1 does not look nearly as good as Q2 and Q3 and Q4. So we are seeing it play out as we had hoped.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nYes. The only thing I would add on the EBITDA margin side, we affirm our guidance for the full year at 40% on the EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. So the simple math suggest as we move to Q2, Q3, we'll be producing EBITDA margins in the mid- to upper-40s contrasting what we reported in Q1 with greater volume. So the year plays out and our forecast continues to look solid.\\n\\nJason Kupferberg\\n\\nOkay. That's all good color. Any sort of update on the Amex alliance? Have you put anything into the guide at this point for that? And then just very quickly on the - it looks like the tax rate you're now expecting something a bit lower, but net income guide didn't change, so just any color there. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nSure. On the Amex side, we updated in the press release, of course, the prospective merchant referrals and the cross referral. That includes elective healthcare, which turned down in, I believe, it was late February, so that continues to progress nicely. On the direct-to-consumer piece, we've actually expanded a piece of the digital capability and the technology build, which has extended the launch just a little bit, but we are expecting that to launch midyear. We continue not - again, not to include that in our 2019 guidance. It would just be premature till we see some results. Rob, on tax rate, you want to comment as to what you see for the full year?\\n\\nRob Partlow\\n\\nYes. For the full year tax rate, we look as right now assuming 19.25%, which is kind of our full year expected tax rate. We did assume that is a little bit lower than our initial guidance. We certainly will continue to examine and think about our guidance. But right now, we are staying in path with our current guidance.\\n\\nJason Kupferberg\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\\n\\nTien-Tsin Huang\\n\\nThanks so much. Just to build on Jason's question just with the acceleration comment in April, just curious on the magnitude for 2Q and I know that the solar comp, I think, is a little bit easier as the draft is moving up. Any other call outs to be clear on 2Q versus second half?\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nDavid's comments regarding the first four months of the year sort of validating the full year, we've got going back seven years of history. So when David used the term anchor, it really becomes quite a predictor for the full year. Because we build our model up by cohorts, certainly in home improvement, our dominant vertical, we've got tremendous visibility and our historical forecasting on volume there has been really quite good to get better with the passage of time. So it's hard not to be enthused. Q2 and Q3 are our season. Logically, the weather gets better, people are doing external work in their homes, the revenue and volumes ebb, as you would expect. Anything, you would add to that David?\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nYes. Good morning. As we indicated, Q1 volume growth grew 20% year-over-year. April loan grew 27% and that's just the beginning of the busy season where we see an acceleration of growth. So we are very pleased with that as a good start for early spring.\\n\\nTien-Tsin Huang\\n\\nThank you for that, that's really helpful. Just on the digital tool side, I think there is 6 points, David, that you mentioned from the Merchant Council Meeting. So is there a backlog of new tools that are going to come out this year to drive some of this penetration? Or is that comment more shaping what you'll be investing in this year going into next?\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nNo, we're spending hand over fist on those tools right now and we have releases every four to six weeks. And so we've got some very exciting tools we'll be announcing and releasing throughout the year.\\n\\nTien-Tsin Huang\\n\\nVery good. Thank you.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nAnd it's completely in response to what we learned from our merchants and our partners and the conversation usually goes, what could we deliver that would dramatically improve your business that obviously further differentiates GreenSky.\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\\n\\nAndrew Jeffrey\\n\\nHey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Good to hear about the progress you're making in elective healthcare. You mentioned several, Gerry, new referral relationships, dental groups, in particular, in that segment of your business. I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit on the sort of the competitive dynamic. Is GreenSky being added in these cases as sort of a new lender or against an existing incumbent or in a lot of cases, are you exclusive? I know I think you mentioned you're preferred in one case. Just wondering about how that kind of plays out and whether a lot of the growth comes from sort of share within these practices?\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nThat's a good question. The dynamic is really predictable. We have no interest in being a second-look provider, first and foremost. So any relationship we initiate or we respond to, should we get an inquiry, it's only with the intention of being a first-look provider. There is an incumbent with significant plastic in people's wallets to suggest that if you adopt GreenSky as your first- look provider, you won't accept the competitor's currency would be a misstatement on our part. But as we all know, it's not the clinician that makes the financing decision, the practice administrator or the finance manager or in case in a one person office, literally a receptionist at the front desk, that para professional, that non-healthcare provider typically is determining who gets the application.\\n\\nWe're not going to stay at a provider that uses GreenSky other than as first-look. So that doesn't mean they won't occasionally let someone that comes in an office with someone else's plastic in their wallet, use that currency, but we are only looking for first look. Accordingly, nobody's going to move their business franchise without going through a beta or a trial, just for prudency. So people will give us 10 locations, a region, a zone, run it for a month, look at approval rates, look at accommodation rates, look at the years of experience, get feedback from the front desk. And in each case, that feedback has been validating, this is a superior user experience, our customers like it, we're being accommodated, we're able to convert folks from a council to a procedure quicker. Those are the ingredients that translate into, what we call, full adoption. But that cycle from trial or beta to full adoption is pretty predictable, but we're not interested in being a second-look provider and being used episodically, that's of no interest to us.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\n\\nGot it. Thank you, that helps. And then is it safe to assume that as with most of the investments you make and the growth you bring on intra-year that these newer referrals, and so forth will contribute to 2020 more so than 2019 from the implement?\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nAbsolutely. Just like the cohorts in home improvement, best case, you'll have someone on a half year and it will take a number of months to mature a new relationship. So there's little and we say this time and time again, there's little we're doing in 2019 in the way of sales activity that's going to materially impact our 2019 results. Those were seeds were sown in 2018 and prior years. It's one of the benefits of the great visibility we have in our business model.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.\\n\\nChris Donat\\n\\nGood morning everyone. Just Rob, I wanted to ask kind of a reminder question as we think about the ramp between the first quarter EBITDA and the full year number. It looks optically like a pretty big move, but if you could remind us the moving pieces in that that like the expenses that drop away that you have in the first quarter? And then some of the other seasonal components, just again looking more for reminder than anything else?\\n\\nRob Partlow\\n\\nYes. No, great. I appreciate the kind of the reminder. The -- certainly, with the seasonality of originations, we fully expect the revenue is going to pop in the second quarter as originations pop, kind of the same seasonal pattern. What we will see is also at the same time, you'll see our FCR expenses come down as some of the seasonality of consumer credit benefits us in the second quarter.\\n\\nAnd correspondingly, while those two things are working in our favor from a cost perspective, I talked about how OpEx actually is not flat, it will be down a couple of million in the second quarter. So what you have is kind of the combination of revenue popping and your expenses coming down, which really help drive that kind of overall increase in the EBITDA margin and EBITDA for the next couple of quarters.\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nI think on our website, we give explicit guidance by quarter of originations. So you can see the sort of pop in the revenue piece assuming a flat take rate. And to Rob's point, that in combination with the elevated volumes in Q2, Q3 reduction in expenses, translates into pretty potent EBITDA production.\\n\\nRob Partlow\\n\\nIt really all falls to the bottom line is what you think about it. And we kind of have this fixed cost OpEx piece of our business and you have a contraction in your margin that first quarter's originations are lower. And then you have that kind of a leverage in the organization really pops in the second and third quarters.\\n\\nChris Donat\\n\\nGot it. But as we think about 2020 and 2021, the seasonality remains the same, right? This isn't a new phenomenon. This is just something is -- just been with the company haven't seen for, okay.\\n\\nRob Partlow\\n\\nAbsolutely. First quarter is always kind of this seasonal headwind. It is always a -- you never feel good about your first quarter, but we actually do feel good about our first quarter because it is exactly as we expected. And as you look back over time, we have the same contraction of our margin and it's really because these seasonality of originations in the consumer credit. And it's always reaffirming, as David highlighted, we really start seeing the benefit, sort of things happening really in March, April, as we've talked about certainly is off to a great second quarter, as you can see originations popping.\\n\\nChris Donat\\n\\nOkay. And then another one, I guess, just also fits in the reminder category. As your health care mix goes from something like 10% to 15% by year-end of revenue, what's the -- just remind us of the difference between say fee rate in healthcare versus home improvement and then also implications for FCR?\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nGood questions. To move from 10% to 15% would suggest that the healthcare business is larger as a percentage of the total pie than it is. It will move to something between 10% and 15%, it won't get to 15% by year-end given the dynamic growth in the home improvement business. We're going to grow that another $1 billion this year. So a lot of big numbers catches up there. With respect to the transaction fee, we do see a higher fee in the healthcare business. It's totally product dependent. I think folks are aware, we launched our first revolving product about six months ago, that's been well received in the marketplace.\\n\\nIf I had to guess, I would think that we'll pencil out 25 to 50 basis points higher in transaction fees, something in that vicinity, not 100 to 150 basis points higher, but it is product mix dependent.\\n\\nChris Donat\\n\\nAnd anything on FCR?\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nGreater use of deferred product mix in healthcare, so you will see a little bit bump in the FCR related to those deferred interest products. That's deferred interest products come with a nice transaction fee and it's cash up front, but we will book the FCR accrual and the seasonality in that accrual will mimic what Rob mentioned earlier year-over-year. So predictively it will ebb and flow from first quarter and things will get stronger, both on the origination side in Q2 and Q3 and the consumer credit cycle where defaults go down around tax refund season. So you have a couple of phenomena contributing to expanding margins in Q2, Q3. It will be the same next year though in that regard.\\n\\nChris Donat\\n\\nOkay. Thanks very much.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nYou're welcome.\\n\\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\\n\\nJames Faucette\\n\\nGreat. Thank you very much for the question. You mentioned, that there had been some acceleration in the month of April, I'm just wondering how much of that is maybe just normal seasonality versus a reflection of improved confidence, et cetera from consumers and your merchant partners?\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nGood morning. Thanks for the question. While it's both, when you are in the middle of winter and people are on vacation and contractors take some vacation and people aren't doing home improvement, you're waiting for spring and then when you see it and you go from 20% growth to 27% year-over-year growth it's certainly nice to be in springtime. So for us it is consistent with seasonality but it's certainly more growth year-over-year in April and we saw in Q1.\\n\\nJames Faucette\\n\\nYes. That makes sense, particularly the year-over-year growth commentary. And then you also mentioned that there was - continue to be a skilled labor shortage is et cetera. How do you think about that and how that may be keeping down your opportunity set right now and is that all a headwind or is there, I guess any other factors that are that we should be aware of that could be limiting what you could do and that you're kind of using in your formulation of outlook and targets for this year?\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nYes, look, I think labor and a volatile political environment has been a headwind for us for years. I don't think that the labor shortage is new. It continues. I think it is amazing that there is so much to consumer demand and merchant demand in such a robust full economy where there is a obvious labor shortage for our platform and I'm amazed at how much growth we're able to earn a and how many merchants were able to sign up and retain and how much additional penetration. We get cohort after cohort after cohort, despite having reported tightness in labor.\\n\\nSo we wanted to communicate it because we're hearing it from our merchants. We've been hearing it for years. We're watching, some very innovative merchant. Literally take a 14 week training programs for kids out of high school and saying give us 14 weeks and we're going to train you on how to be an HVAC technician. Really amazing where they're creating their own trade schools, so we have the pleasure of getting to see entrepreneurs being beautifully entrepreneurial.\\n\\nSo yes, there's a labor shortage and that certainly not helped by the immigration policies or the volatility, the immigration policies, but nevertheless, we've seen great growth over the last three years.\\n\\nDavid Zalik\\n\\nYes, I don't think we've had a call with an investor group where someone on the phone hasn't reported that they want something done at their home and it's four to six weeks before they can get anybody to come out and give them a quote, let alone start a piece of business. So it's a common phenomenon that seems to be occurring all across the country. No, geographic pocket, but everywhere, guess the result of full employment.\\n\\nJames Faucette\\n\\nThat's useful. Thank you.\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\\n\\nRob Wildhack\\n\\nHey guys, you talk about a couple of new verticals and mentioned e-Commerce in particular that seems more competitive with Fintech. So first, is there anything different in the required investment in a new vertical as it could be showing up in OpEx today? And secondly, can you just talk about maybe some broader strategic differences when entering into a new vertical like ecom?\\n\\nGerry Benjamin\\n\\nHello, Rob with Autonomous. Good morning. Good question. So we are a Fintech and we have unique advantages over very different approach to some of the ecommerce only credit platforms, what we see is they tend to focus on small ticket and subprime and near prime and our solution is number one, omnichannel, which means there are lots of retailers that have physical stores and showrooms and retail stores as well as website e-commerce. So that gives us a wonderful competitive advantage to be able to engage a merchant consumer who might start to shopping online concluded in a store or the other way around and so our differentiation is in the omnichannel, in the ability to support superfast, prime, large transactions, which by the way, is where most of the commerce happens.\\n\\nIt is not our business model to provide credit to those that don't have an abundance of credit. That's not what our banks are looking for and it's not where commerce happens. So when we enter a new vertical just as we did health care, we look for where there is friction and how we can use technology and tools to accelerate commerce and create value-added differentiation. We're doing that in healthcare, we're doing that in e-commerce, in specialty retail, it's the same platform. So we are spending aggressively investing in our technology, not only to continue to add features functionality tools in our home improvement platform, but also in our elective healthcare platform. Now e-commerce and specialty retail.\\n\\nOne thing that's very gratifying is the investments that we make in one of these verticals, many of them help the other ones. So we're investing in e- commerce, while it turns out there's lots of home improvement and home good companies that want to use those tools too. So it's one vertical is helping the other. Rob, did I answer your question.\\n\\nRob Wildhack\\n\\nYou did. Yes. Thank you, that was really helpful.\\n\\nAnd that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Rebecca Gardy for any further remarks.\\n\\nRebecca Gardy\\n\\nThank you, Chris. We want to thank, everyone, for joining us today. Our next quarterly earnings call will be the first week of August. So we look forward to speaking with you, again, then if not sooner.\\n\\nWith that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

In addition we will furnish a copy of our prepared remarks on Form 8-K later this morning.\\n\\nI'll now turn the call over to Scott.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nThanks, Whit. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our results for the second quarter of 2019. Before we review our financial performance, I would like to take a moment to talk about the tragedy which occurred at our Henry Pratt facility in Aurora, Illinois. For our Company, February 15th of this year will forever be remembered for this senseless tragedy.\\n\\nWe lost many Mueller family members that day. Our hearts continue to be with the victims and their loved ones, the first responders, and the Aurora community. The Mueller family continues to be strong and resilient as team members come together to support and comfort one another in the face of this tragedy. We are incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement we have received from the Aurora community and our colleagues and friends across the country.\\n\\nWe partnered with the National Compassion Fund to provide direct financial support to the families of our colleagues that were lost and the employees that were impacted by this heartbreaking event. This fund makes it simple for anyone looking to support the families and affected Henry Pratt employees as they begin on their path to healing.\\n\\nWhat we've seen in the wake of this tragedy from our Pratt team members and from employees around the globe is the embodiment of the values of the Mueller family. From an operations standpoint, our Pratt family of employees has continued to support each other while also focusing on the needs of our customers who have been incredibly supportive as well. After a few weeks, the facility was fully operational although the event caused shipment delays along with other impacts, team members throughout the organization responded with incredible speed and compassion. I am very proud of the team and their commitment to each other.\\n\\nI'll now turn to our financial performance during the quarter. Please turn to Slide 4. Overall, our second quarter performance was below expectations as we faced many challenges from slower than anticipated residential construction and severe weather as well as the impact of the Aurora tragedy. As a reminder, in the second quarter of last year, our net sales increased 16.8%, which was our strongest quarter of net sales growth last year.\\n\\nIn the quarter, we generated a slight increase in net sales as the benefit from our recent acquisition of Krausz Industries helped offset lower volumes at both Infrastructure and Technologies. We also continued to realize improved pricing at Infrastructure which more than covered inflationary costs. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 5.4% in the quarter driven by improvements in both Infrastructure and Technologies in addition to lower corporate G&A.\\n\\nDespite the challenges this quarter, our year-to-date net sales and adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% and 11.1% respectively. We believe our end markets remain healthy driven by steady growth in the municipal markets with residential construction market returning to growth in the second half of the year. In conjunction with improving execution by our teams, we expect to increase net sales and adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Martie.\\n\\nMartie Zakas\\n\\nThanks, Scott and good morning everyone. First, I would like to thank everyone for your support and encouragement after the Aurora tragedy. We are grateful for all your generosity and thoughtfulness. I will discuss our second quarter consolidated financial results and then review our segment performance. Consolidated net sales for the 2019 second quarter increased $800,000 to $234 million driven by the acquisition of Krausz Industries and higher pricing at Infrastructure partially offset by lower volumes at both Infrastructure and Technologies.\\n\\nOur gross profit margin improved slightly versus the prior year despite the decrease in volumes as higher pricing more than offset higher material costs, freight and other expenses. Material costs increased approximately 3% year-over-year in the quarter.\\n\\nAdditionally, cost of goods sold included a $2.2 million inventory step-up amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Krausz Industries. Excluding this impact, our gross profit this quarter would have been $77 million with a 32.9% gross margin which is a 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $45.7 million in the quarter, a $3 million increase over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Krausz Industries. SG&A as a percent of net sales was 19.5% in the second quarter as compared with 18.3% in the prior year.\\n\\nAdjusted operating income decreased $500,000 to $31.3 million in the second quarter. Operating performance at Technologies improved this quarter and helped offset a decrease in adjusted operating income at Infrastructure. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2019 second quarter increased $2.3 million or 5.4% to $44.7 million. Over the last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $187.6 million or 20.1% of net sales.\\n\\nWe have increased adjusted EBITDA $14.7 million or 8.5% over the prior 12 month period. During the second quarter, we recorded $6.9 million of strategic reorganization and other charges including $4.3 million of one-time expenses related to the Aurora tragedy and $1.1 million to exit a multi-employer pension plan.\\n\\nTurning now to taxes. For the 2019 second quarter, we reported net income tax expense of $3.9 million or 26.4% of income before tax. In the second quarter of the prior year, we recorded a $7.5 million provisional one-time expense for the transition tax on previously untaxed undistributed foreign earnings.\\n\\nOur adjusted net income per share was $0.12 for the quarter, the same as the prior year quarter. Our 2019 quarterly adjusted EPS excludes the strategic reorganization and other charges mentioned earlier, the inventory step-up amortization associated with the acquisition of Krausz Industries, $1 million in expenses related to existing legacy pension plans, and $500,000 of interest expense associated with the Walter tax accrual.\\n\\nTurning now to segment performance starting with Infrastructure. Infrastructure net sales increased $3 million or 1.4% to $214.1 million in the second quarter due to the acquisition of Krausz Industries and higher pricing, partially offset by lower volumes. The decrease in volumes was driven by challenges from lower residential construction and severe weather as well as the impact of delayed shipments resulting from the Aurora facility being closed for about two weeks after the tragedy.\\n\\nAdjusted operating income for the second quarter decreased $1.6 million to $43.4 million primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher costs associated with inflation, partially offset by higher pricing. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2019 second quarter increased $300,000 to $54.8 million yielding an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.6% for this segment.\\n\\nMoving onto Technologies. Technologies net sales decreased $2.2 million to $19.9 million in the quarter driven by lower volumes at Echologics, which were partially offset by sales growth at Metrology. The decrease in volumes at Echologics is related to the timing of orders for EchoShore-DX nodes from a couple of large customers. We are encouraged by the progress Technologies has made this year.\\n\\nOur adjusted operating performance improved approximately $300,000 in the 2019 second quarter to a loss of $3.6 million primarily due to improved manufacturing performance and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by lower volumes. In addition, Technologies adjusted EBITDA improved $700,000 in the quarter.\\n\\nNow I'll review our liquidity. Cash used in operating activities for the current year-to-date was $29.1 million primarily due to the timing of collections, planned inventory production spending, and $14.9 million in income tax payments during the period. We also invested $30.5 million in capital expenditures in the period as compared with $14.4 million last year as we accelerated investments in our manufacturing capabilities particularly our large casting foundry in Chattanooga.\\n\\nAt March 2019, we had total debt of $445.7 million and cash and cash equivalents of $134.3 million. At the end of the second quarter, our net debt leverage ratio was 1.7 times. I'll turn the call back to Scott to talk more about our results and updated outlook for 2019.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nThanks, Martie. We remain focused on executing our key strategies to grow and enhance our business by accelerating new product development, driving operational excellence, and delivering go-to-market strategies as a more customer-focused organization. Despite the challenges in the second quarter, we are making progress on our sales strategies with improved price realization more than offsetting inflation in the quarter.\\n\\nAfter implementing our latest price increases, we believe that we are close to covering the cumulative impact of material cost inflation, which started in 2017. We expect that improvements in our conversion margin will come from higher sales growth and productivity initiatives in addition to continued price realization. We have implemented initiatives we believe will enhance our operational execution and draw cost savings and can help fund future investments in margin expansion.\\n\\nWe have a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on enhancing our position as a water infrastructure company and adding long-term value for our shareholders. Supported by a strong balance sheet, we will continue to balance our cash flow among strategic investments to strengthen and grow the business while returning a portion of our cash to shareholders. We continue to prioritize reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures to help support our strategic growth initiatives as well as to keep our facilities poised for manufacturing improvements.\\n\\nIn addition, we are refocused on enhancing organic growth through strategic acquisitions and we'll look for opportunities to expand our product portfolio, extend our reach into adjacent channels, and broaden our geographic footprint. We continue to make progress with the integration of Krausz Industries. I am very encouraged by the collaboration among the teams and opportunities ahead of us with Krausz as well as with future acquisitions.\\n\\nI will wrap up my comments with a review of our current full year expectations for consolidated results. We are adjusting our annual guidance expectations for fiscal 2019 to reflect our second quarter performance and what we believe is a temporary slowdown in residential construction in 2019. During the second half of fiscal 2019, we anticipate growth in all of our end markets. This includes residential construction returning to growth in the second half of the year.\\n\\nOverall, we remain positive on the residential portion of our business given the macroeconomic drivers including favorable demographics, job growth, interest rates, and low housing supply. We believe the municipal market remains healthy despite severe weather impacting construction days in the many regions in the US during our second quarter and we expect municipal spending to grow in the mid-single digit range in the second half of the year.\\n\\nAs a result, we anticipate that our consolidated net sales will grow between 7% and 9% in 2019 and we will increase adjusted EBITDA between 12% and 15%.\\n\\nMartie will now provide some final comments on our 2019 outlook.\\n\\nMartie Zakas\\n\\nThanks, Scott. For 2019, we expect the depreciation and amortization will be between $53 million and $56 million which includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Krausz. Corporate SG&A expenses are expected to be between $34 million and $36 million.\\n\\nNet interest expense is expected to be between $23 million and $24 million. Our effective income tax rate for the full year is expected to be between 25% and 27%. Finally, we currently expect capital expenditures to be between $60 million and $65 million and we continue to evaluate additional investment opportunities.\\n\\nWith that operator, please open the call for questions.\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\\n\\nDeane Dray\\n\\nThank you. Good morning everyone.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nGood morning, Dean.\\n\\nDeane Dray\\n\\nHey, I just wanted to add our deepest condolences to the Mueller team and all the families impacted and also appreciate how Scott you and the team responded as an organization and just wanted to add that this morning to open up the call. Just moving on if we can, I always find it interesting and I know weather impacts you and what I think is important is you can you walk through how much of that gets recouped when it comes to municipalities, you know there's restrictions on overtime and there's only so much daylight that they can be working. So how much of that demand perishes and how much of that demand comes back and can you size it for us please?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, I think the way we think about it and then I'll try and size it. The way we think about it is, the capacity to do maintenance I think is fixed and so when you lose days, those days are basically pushing into the future until you have a crisis. So I think of that -- the municipal part that is let's call it non-contract but with city workers.\\n\\nThat piece of it kind of gets pushed into the future and then the contract piece where the contractor has to flex their workforce or flex their work schedule, I think that tends to get evened out in a shorter period of time, that is to say that it's kind of a workforce capacity conundrum.\\n\\nSo when we think about you know Q3, our fiscal Q3 and Q4, I think that the lost opportunity is about half of what will simply drift into the future, but I also think on a large scale team that as the infrastructure ages, more of this drifting will become a bigger and bigger problem as crisis become breaks become more frequent. So the behavior, the flex capacity will have to change in the industry. That's helpful.\\n\\nDeane Dray\\n\\nThat's helpful. And then on the price cost side, I was interested in your comments that you expect to be offsetting the material cost increases that you've seen actually going back to 2017 and if you could dissect for us where are you getting pricing? Any push back from the customers and how much of your price increases have actually been sticking?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, so our most recent iron price increase was September, our most recent brass effective in, I believe, was April, Martie?\\n\\nMartie Zakas\\n\\nYes and we did have another iron in February of this year as well.\\n\\nDeane Dray\\n\\nRight, so two if you will in fairly short order as steel has been a lot of inflationary pressures. So we have been -- since we reached the inflection point in Q4 of '16 which is kind of when commodity bottomed out and we've been on this multi-quarter inflationary cycle, we have been -- trying to make sure that we keep track of what the inflation impact to our cost base is and ensure we at least get that back.\\n\\nSo my comments were meant to say since 2017 at long last we have finally broken through the inflationary cycle and the sum of price increases is now slightly exceeding the sum of inflation for that period. As to whether it's sticky or not, we're pretty firm when we go with a price. I think we've got discipline. I suspect there were some customers playing a little bit of chicken to see if we would blink on the most recent price increases, but we've seen bookings certainly in April look like we're not going to have any trouble keeping these most recent pricing activities to stick. So broad-based national scale and good yields so far.\\n\\nOur next question is from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.\\n\\nMason Marion\\n\\nHi, this is Mason Marion on for Mike. Can you talk through each of your end markets and the trend you are seeing today particularly within municipalities and your backlog of any work.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, Mason, we don't actually talk much about backlog. I think it's helpful in some instances but not so much in the longer cycle stuff like the new [indiscernible]. So let's talk about the end markets. I think resi was 288,000 housing starts in the quarter and -- or 260,000, sorry, housing starts in the quarter, down from 288,000 a year earlier. So it was a tough quarter and I believe that is all inter-related to this weather problem.\\n\\nI mean if you look at the lumber guys, if you look and talk to the homebuilders, basically everybody's saying the same thing. It is a hot Seattle market, a hot market, weather played a big piece of not having enough construction days available to get things done and therefore, we've seen broad based kind of cranking in those markets and even in muni. The rest of the country though that wasn't impacted by the weather, we saw good growth in the muni market and so I believe spending and maintenance is still ongoing in most and the need for spending on maintenance is still ongoing in most of the muni area.\\n\\nAll in all, looking forward, I think that we will see some of that pent up demand that we were talking to Dean about earlier caused by the weather to come in to Q3 and Q4, let's say half of it in the muni space and we'll see a return to growth given low housing inventories and pretty good demographic. So expect growth to return in Q3 and Q4 for us then.\\n\\nMason Marion\\n\\nAll right, great. And then on the Krausz acquisition, how is the integration going? Are you on pace to hit the synergies you guys expected when you acquired it and your appetite for any more M&A at this point?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, I would say that the team has done a really good job and that the collaboration is going very well between the Krausz team and the Mueller team. I think that we remain on track to hit our growth and synergy targets for the business you know the market notwithstanding and I also think that as we move through the integration process, we are getting to the point where we would start entertaining more acquisitions, but I don't think we have anything imminent.\\n\\nMason Marion\\n\\nOur next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Your line is open.\\n\\nAndrew Buscaglia\\n\\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. If you could talk a little bit about on your Infrastructure side sort of where do you stand in terms of the implementation of leaner manufacturing and some of the cost savings initiatives that you have been talking about over the last several quarters. Are those still on track and should we expect to see Infrastructure grow in 2019 in terms of margin?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, so let me break that down into a couple of pieces. I think that the lean journey is a multi-year journey and we are in our early stages of that journey and so if you were -- I won't I won't go operations geek on you and start talking about Kaizens and where we are in 5S and et cetera but still relatively early days, but should we expect margins to increase, yes, we should.\\n\\nI think that the team has done a really good job with our cost savings programs and I think the management of the CapEx and modernizing some of the machine shops and modernizing some of the foundries remains on track and therefore you should expect to see real cash positive increases and I think cash positive because we recognize we're pushing a bow wave of depreciation in front of us as a result of the increased CapEx levels.\\n\\nSo I think there's good performance and you should continue to expect to see improvements in gross margin from our cost savings CapEx and pricing activities in Infrastructure going forward. I think that the reason it's been muted for the last two years and it has been muted. I think our progress in manufacturing has been greater than we've been able to display financially because of the inflation that's been massive inflation in steel and brass really muted the progress the manufacturing team has been making.\\n\\nAndrew Buscaglia\\n\\nOkay, that's helpful. In your Technologies segment too you had mentioned some delayed orders. Can you just talk a little bit about those. When do you expect those to resume?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, not delayed orders, I want to be clear that it's timing of orders. You'll recall when we grew last year we'd announced the big San Jose order multi nodes we had Eastbaymod, American Water, a lot of EchoShore-DX nodes. Many of those actually shipped in the second quarter of last year. This year while we continue to have record bookings, though our bookings are up more than double-digits in the Echologics business year-over-year through the first two quarters. The timing of those orders and when we can start shipping those EchoShore-DXs moves into Q3, Q4 and then Q1 of '20.\\n\\nAnd so the main message there is our bookings for nodes is actually up substantially. Our timing of when we can ship those nodes is becoming more spread out over the coming three quarters but it is a timing issue and so we should have a blip there and I would like to reiterate what Martie said earlier that for everybody on the phone the meter, the Metrology business grew in the quarter. It was just the noise associated with shipping all of those San Jose nodes in Q2 last year that caused the segment to show sales shrinking.\\n\\nAndrew Buscaglia\\n\\nOkay. Thanks very much.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nOur next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrian Lee\\n\\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I also wanted to express my condolences to your team and all those impacted by the tragedy here. Maybe first for you Scott on the question front, bigger picture just there's been some data points across different end markets that would suggest and particularly in construction you're seeing some pressure on the labor side. So wondering if any parts of your business you're seeing labor shortages impacting the end markets or sort of the rates of I guess volume and demand.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, I think the labor shortage issue is one that's certainly hitting homebuilders more than it would be hitting the contractors that we tend to be dealing with, but with that said, the economy is still fairly active and larger than it's ever been at any point in its history and therefore I think if you take the coupling of our tightening of immigration policy for skilled and semi-skilled labor along with where we are from a demand point of view that it is certainly something we feel. Now with that said, I think that curb and gutter going in and the concrete work, excavation work has been more stable for contractors over the past let's call it seven years.\\n\\nSo the likelihood that we're not in quite as cyclical a labor market is better for us, but with that said, as I said earlier to Dean, we're not going to see flex capacity in this area for municipal maintenance or for curb and gutter in new residential construction. So I think we're -- we have some growth capacity left, but we're rapidly approaching where we're going to need to inject more labor and more crews into the works.\\n\\nBrian Lee\\n\\nOkay fair enough. And then just a second question on costs. I know you guys sound a lot more positive on the price cost dynamic than you have in some time, are you seeing any pressures though here to start the year or maybe on the horizon that could swing that price cost dynamic back out of your favor again and the reason I ask is given the margin performance in both Technologies and Infrastructure, I'm wondering outside of volumes which you mentioned if there are other levers that you would think have to move in your favor for the EBITDA growth targets to be achieved this year. Thanks guys.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, I think as long as we have a low/no inflation steel and brass environment, we should be able to do it. Now everybody wakes up in the morning and see what was tweeted. I mean 25% in increase starting Friday on steel tariffs would probably drive the scrap steel market to start seeing some increases and then we'd have a lag again. Those are all things that certainly we would be concerned about, trying to recover in the short term. So we couldn't wake up Friday morning and find out that steel was up, scrap steel had started a 10%, 15%, 20% inflationary crawl like it did the last time we put in the tariffs.\\n\\nSo those things notwithstanding, we would expect a relatively flat commodity environment with no shocks coming from the era of discussion. Other than that though, I think that they are achievable. I'd like to reiterate too what Martie said earlier in her comments. We had 100 basis points improvement in gross margin. If it weren't for taking the inventory step-up in Krausz, which is about -- what did you say Martie? $2.2 million a quarter and so it's amortized and so that's good price and price cost performance that 100 basis points from operations I think is encouraging. Obviously, we also need volume from the end market. So we have to be right about this continued growth projection.\\n\\nBrian Lee\\n\\nOkay, makes sense. Thanks guys.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nOur next question is from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\\n\\nWalter Liptak\\n\\nHi. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the resi part of the business too and just any trends that you're seeing in April and I know you guys dig really deep into geographic regions and I wonder if it's possible just to plus and minus the geographic regions maybe looking better in April and I've heard of some continued weather impacts in April. I wonder how you're feeling about how the quarter started out?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nSo our outlook is supported by what we saw in April. I think that both bookings and shipments give us pause and say yes, we are right that resi will return to growth from our April result. So yes, we're encouraged. I'm not going to get into regional sales performance because I think it's too much from a competitive point of view, but just like I think if you look at the lumber industry and you look at the house building data, the hot markets for resi have been the American Southwest, the Pacific Northwest particularly Seattle and Portland, Oregon and then in Tennessee you see real tons of growth in the Nashville area and they all just basically disappeared in Q2.\\n\\nAnd I don't think there's anything fundamental about what's going on in Seattle, Portland, the American Southwest migration or Nashville that would lead me to believe that somehow demand has fundamentally stopped. So I expect those regional markets to return to growth and that's kind of why we've had this somewhat bullish view that -- we had a ton of snow in Seattle. Nashville was under six, 10 inches of water for most of the second quarter. So yes, I think that they'll all come back and that's why we remain bullish on the outlook for our year.\\n\\nWalter Liptak\\n\\nOkay, sounds good. And if I could switch over to the tech part of the business. With this, the project timing looking good for the next three quarters. I wonder if you would comment about EBITDA levels. Could we see EBITDA turning profitable and maybe give us a kind of a magnitude on that?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, when I do the guidance I always try to do the consolidated guidance. I can tell you that the Technologies engineering teams currently are working on the pressure modules for hydrants. They're working on transducers. They're working on a myriad of things that wouldn't show up in the Technologies business but those engineering costs are embedded there. So I'm not going to get into saying when it will return to profitability. I think the emergence of 5G also means that on our radios we're going to have another development cycle in nodes. So I think that those are things that are positioning us well for the future.\\n\\nOverall, I think that the EchoShore-DX business continues to be something that gives us encouragement. We're having good success locating leaks with it. I think that the development of the software so that we're able to run more and more machine-learning algorithms to start looking at the acoustic signature of the devices that we can actually get into better predictive maintenance modeling is also going very well. So I think these are relatively in $1 billion business the Technologies segment, $100 million-ish and has the bulk of the engineering expenses in it, I think it's really good investment to give us a window on where the future of water will be and we're committed to it.\\n\\nWith that said, I expect the meter business by itself without Echo, without the software load, without the aid all of that to continue to make the progress they've been making and so I think it's important to acknowledge the team that all of the improvement we saw year-over-year I think it was $700,000 in EBITDA Martie, came from the meter manufacturing team. That's all work on price, that's work in projects and working the manufacturing floor.\\n\\nSo all really good progress and it gets muted when we continue with these technology development items or the EchoShore and Echologics investments, but I do think they're good investments for the future. So will it return to profitability? I don't think in the next six months if it will. We might have a quarter of profitability if you get enough demand in it, but I think the development projects are the things that I review with the team and I am encouraged by the progress they're making.\\n\\nWalter Liptak\\n\\nOkay great. Sounds promising. Thank you.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nOur next question is from Zane Karimi with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\\n\\nZane Karimi\\n\\nGood morning guys. This is Zane on for Brent. I want to -- first I want to provide my deepest condolences to you and the rest of the team at Mueller.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nZane Karimi\\n\\nAnd then I was kind of thinking you also talked about Krausz and how it's performing well relative to your expectations, but I was wondering if you have any growth rates for them on a standalone basis for this quarter and what you're seeing as potential improvements for this acquisition and integration down the road.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nI'm going to ask Martie to keep me honest here, but I think the number was around $11 million in the quarter.\\n\\nMartie Zakas\\n\\nYes, and their contribution to sales -- net sales in our second quarter.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, so that would be for them just right at I think that double-digit kind of line for the quarter year-over-year, but I'm not sure about that. I know their American ship business was good and the European was a little softer, but overall, the qualitative aspects of my comments were based on the progress I see with the team integrating, the sales forces working together, the joint calls that are going on between -- where Krausz frankly have good relationships and we were able to leverage their relationships and saw decent people that we hadn't met before and conversely where our sales team had good relationships and we were able to bring Krausz in and get them established fairly quickly.\\n\\nSo I think the ground work things to ensure that we get the growth we want have been done in these last 90 days. I do feel like the ground work stuff of -- salesmen can be turf and say I'm not taking this person here, but we haven't had any of that and I think everybody's been very professional and very realistic about what has to happen in order for us to recognize and realize our growth potential together and I've been pleased by making sure that those activities have happened, but I think the -- if it's around $11 million, I'm not sure what the growth rate was Martie, but --\\n\\nMartie Zakas\\n\\nWe just generally said that as you looked at where Krausz has been, it's been sort of growing in net sales in a low-double digit and then just with respect to EBITDA, we said it was pretty much in line with Mueller Water Products, just to give you an idea.\\n\\nZane Karimi\\n\\nThank you for that color there. And then I was hoping you'll could talk a little bit more on the M&A pipeline and with regards to a preference on geographic expansion or a product portfolio expansion and how you look at that moving forward?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nSure, you know this is kind of reminiscent of a couple of the early conference calls but we have certain adjacencies that we've identified that we like in both North America, Southeast Asia, Western Europe in particular. We think where age of infrastructure is an issue kind of post-World War 2 development I think that we feel like we have both knowledge of what the state of the network is and adoptability of our technologies and products.\\n\\nWith that said, we have very strong channel relationships in North America. So adjacencies that would utilize our existing channels are very attractive to us because we think that we know whether we can leverage a product into an industrial channel or something else. So I think that the pipeline is full of both the geographic expansion opportunities as well as getting into some of the other industrial and niche water market areas that we think our channel and/or our manufacturing expertise could be leveraged.\\n\\nOur next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open.\\n\\nConference Call Participants\\n\\nGood morning. This is Rob Dunn for Joe. I just had a quick question when I go back to the discussion around your price increases. Did you see any pre-buy activity related to your price increases and could you quantify that if possible?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nYes, we don't quantify it but we always see a little blip around -- we announced the price increase, the distributors have I believe it's 30 days to get their systems in line with it at an effective date in the future and they can buy and have a release and generally some of them try and pre-buy and we saw some of that, but nothing out of the ordinary and it wasn't remarkable in any way, it was kind of in line with last February's price increase.\\n\\nConference Call Participants\\n\\nThat's great. Thank you.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nOur next question is from Jose Garza with Gabelli Asset Management. Your line is open.\\n\\nJose Garza\\n\\nHey good morning guys.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nGood morning, Jose.\\n\\nJose Garza\\n\\nGood morning. As others I just want express condolences here. I guess in terms of the quick one on just the corporate expense Martie, it looks like it's kind of been running kind of at a $32 million level but it looks like you guys are guiding for a little bit higher. Is there anything just to call out there that is worth noting.\\n\\nMartie Zakas\\n\\nI would say nothing to call out. You'll find out sometimes with corporate expenses there can just be timing matters among the different quarters, but overall as we as we look out for the year, I think we lowered our guidance very slightly with respect to outlook for the corporate expenses for the full year running between $34 and $36 million.\\n\\nJose Garza\\n\\nOkay and on share repurchases, none year-to-date I guess just kind of fill us in on how you guys are thinking about those and in the context of other spending that you guys are undergoing?\\n\\nMartie Zakas\\n\\nYes certainly. I'd say overall as we look at capital allocation as we talked about we look for it to be a balanced approach. Certainly looking at returning to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases as well as considering acquisitions and our capital investments and certainly having closed Krausz in our first quarter, that was certainly a large use of cash for us.\\n\\nAdditionally, we've talked about the level of capital expenditures where we are currently looking at about $60 million to $65 million for our year which is an increase versus 2018 and we're also considering some additional investments as well. So I'd say we certainly have all that on our mind and if we look since December of 2016 when you look at the combination between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned about $155 million in cash to shareholders. So I'd say going forward, we've got about $160 million that remains in authorization for share repurchase and we will continue to look at all of those components of capital allocation going forward.\\n\\nJose Garza\\n\\nOkay and did I hear you correctly that Krausz was $11 million contribution?\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nI said around $11 million. I wasn't quoting an exact number, but around $11 million Jose.\\n\\nJose Garza\\n\\nOkay, thanks very much guys.\\n\\nScott Hall\\n\\nThank you. Okay, I think that's all the time we have for questions and I wanted to try to go through a couple of things. I think mainly I think the express a sense of pride for how the team has handled what was a very difficult quarter both from a operational impact point of view as a result of the tragedy and also the pride from the fact that despite the challenges that we saw from the weather and things we've been talking about for the last 45 minutes that we were able to pick our heads up and continue to make progress with both the operational improvements as well as the integration of Krausz and the progress with customers and so I was very happy with that. I'd like to thank you all for your support.\\n\\nMany of you reached out to me in February and I wanted to personally say thank you for all your support and encouragement and I wanted to close the call with a quick update on a former Mueller family member since many individuals in the investment community have been involved with Mueller since it was spun out as a publicly traded company, I wanted to let you know that our Chairman and CEO, Greg Hyland, the founder of basically original IPO, CEO passed away a couple of weeks ago.\\n\\nFor more than two years, from the day I got here, Greg was waging a ferocious battle against cancer before he finally succumbed to the disease and I had known Greg since 2001 and was always a fan of his gregarious nature and business acumen and humanity.\\n\\nI will always remember Greg as being a perfect gentleman and our thoughts here are with Brenda and his family, but I wanted to let you know that Greg had passed because I know there had been some questions over time about where he went so quickly, but he has been waging a battle for the last 2.5 years. So thank you all for your interest and I hope you have a great week. And operator, that's all we have.\\n\\nThank you. This now concludes today's conference.

Narbeh?\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nThank you, Joel, and welcome to everyone joining us today. First quarter revenue of $28.1 million, exceeded the high end of our guidance and increased 84% over the prior year period. Reflecting continued strong organic growth combined with revenue contribution from our two acquisitions last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was up 230 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially to 49.4% as an improved mix of higher margin products continues to drive gross margins towards our target model of 50% to 55%. With our acquisitions integrated, we've now largely achieved the targeted $6 million to $8 million of annual cost synergies ahead of plan. We are also beginning to realize increased opportunities from cross-selling to customers as a fully integrated semiconductor systems and software company targeting IoT.\\n\\nLooking at our first quarter revenue in more detail, our top 20 customers represented 51% of total revenue, while remaining 49% was distributed across approximately 5,000 end customers. In terms of end markets, industrial represented approximately 47% of total revenue, while consumer and computing represented 41%. Our mixed up consumer segments revenue increased in Q1 sequentially for two primary reasons. First, this reflects the ongoing success of our strategy to expand content at Tier 1 consumer customers within our memory division. Second, a few of our current ASIC projects are in the consumer IoT space and they contributed to the overall segment contribution.\\n\\nOne important point to highlight is that even though we had relatively higher revenue contents in the consumer segments in Q1 as compared to what historical trends, our gross margins expanded sequentially underscoring the high value nature of our solutions in both industrial and consumer markets. The remaining 12% of revenue was spread across communications, medical and other end markets.\\n\\nAs many of you know, we held our first Analyst Day in New York in March. I'd like to thank all the participants, some of whom maybe on this call. At the event, we had the opportunity to introduce the new Adesto and highlight our transformation over the past year. We are now well positioned as a global provider of application specific semiconductors and embedded systems for the IoT from the edge to gateways up to the cloud including software tools that our customers use as building blocks to transform their businesses.\\n\\nWe also outlined our product roadmap with the focus on the segment opportunities we're targeting in each of our three businesses. More importantly, we also highlighted how different tiers of the technologies we have assembled in Adesto can converge to address major challenges that our customers are facing in adopting IoT, particularly in the industrial segments. These unique value proposition of full stack technology solutions targeting industrial IoT will result in continued high margin revenue for Adesto in the years ahead.\\n\\nNow I'll review the recent developments across the three solutions groups beginning with the memory solutions. In a quarter where both of our top competitors had double digit year-over-year and sequential declines in their memory businesses. Our memory group perform extremely well growing double digit year-over-year and sequentially as well. Furthermore, we continue our momentum by securing new design wins across our product families. Notable this quarter included design wins in our stronghold metering markets as well as industrial instrumentation and they vehicle tracking and telematics.\\n\\nOur Q1 consumer customer is also ramping as expected with our standard Flash product. We are expanding our engagement with this customer and also recently secured a design win for our DataFlash product family. We also announced that OPKIX and maker of compact wearable smart cameras as well as companion studio editing and sharing applications is using Adesto's nonvolatile memory in it's tiny powerful wearable video cameras OPKIXOne. Last quarter I highlighted our first 32 megabit EcoXiP design win the leading fitness tracker customer, which is expected to enter volume production late this year and ramp into 2020.\\n\\nThe annual unit volumes for this opportunity are expected to be in mid 7 digits. This opportunity is on track as our customer is progressing well through it's qualification. I also announced during last calls the introduction of two new EcoXiP products, the 128 megabit and the 64 megabit versions, scheduled for release in the first half of this year. Last quarter we released the 128 megabit EcoXiP for customer sampling and expect to release the 64 meg version this quarter. These two new products will expand our opportunities for EcoXiP family on the heels of the momentum we are now seeing with the 32 megabit version.\\n\\nIn general, new opportunities for EcoXiP continued to grow as indicated by sampling activity across diverse applications including industrial control, e-bike, home automation and card readers among others. We have sampled over 30 opportunities with EcoXiP in the last six months reflecting a more than 3x increase over the same period last year. In late February, we formally introduced our new Fusion HD family that builds upon our successful Fusion family, which was first introduced in 2015. Fusion HD is manufactured on a 65 nanometer process and addresses higher densities, 32 megabit to 8 megabit, as compared to the previous Fusion devices. Fusion HD also includes new features to enhance system performance and reduce costs.\\n\\nFor example, Fusion HD includes a new suit of intelligence supervisory functions including an integrated battery health monitor and a system reset generator, which will uses the system materials, overall system costs and physical footprint. And of course Fusion HD builds on the low power architecture, the origin of Fusion family was known for and can deliver up to 70% lower power consumption then competitive parts. The 32 megabits Fusion HD samples are available now and are sampling with customers in industrial sensor, wearable and home security applications. We expect a broad rollout of the family in the second half of 2019.\\n\\nI also highlighted our MavriqCM design win last quarter, which is another 7 digit unit opportunity annually. Production orders for this opportunity commenced in the quarter and are expected to continue throughout the year. We continue to work actively with many other accounts in the camera module space as we build on this initial win. Channel partners are an important part of our go-to-market strategy. Our partnership with NXP started with EcoXiP and it has now expanded to other application specific memory product families we have.\\n\\nDuring the quarter we announced that NXP evaluation kit board has RT1015 crossover processor has Adesto's memory onboard. Now customers on NXP platform can choose from a variety of costs performance and power options to build their systems using our memories for consumer electronics, home and building automation and industrial IoT products.\\n\\nNow let me give you an update on our ASIC solutions. As indicated previously our ASIC group specializes in system on chips that include a heavy dose of mix signal RF and analog blocks. In particular, our solutions are used in satellite communication markets including asset and cargo tracking, industrial control, and more recently in consumer markets. The revenue for this group consists of three buckets. First, there is NRE revenue we receive for designing the chip for the customer. Once the ASIC chips are designed and delivered to the customer, and the customer transitions to production, and as a part of the agreement, we supply actual ASICs for the life of the product. Finally, the third revenue vector for us is licensing of intellectual property.\\n\\nAs a result of our ASIC projects, we often develop analog and mixed-signal IP cores that we then license to third parties. Last quarter we indicated that two ASIC projects were completed and delivered to our customers. One of this was in the satellite communication market, while the other was in the cellular communication broadband to home applications. The former completed qualification and the last one is expected to complete qualification this quarter. We reiterate our expectation that both of these should start early production ramping Q4 of this year and accelerate in 2020 and beyond.\\n\\nTwo other active ASIC design projects move forward in the first quarter. Both of these projects are in the consumer space. One of these projects is a touch controller and the other is in the AR/VR space. Our team delivered design milestones and these two projects are tracking on schedule. The expectation is for these two designs to be in production in 2020.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, we also made progress with several new opportunities including one in the agricultural IoT space, which we discussed last time, a new opportunity in the satellite communication space with a new customer. And one for a wireline communication ASIC for a connected car. And finally a high volume smart lock ASIC with a market leader in that space. Indecently this last opportunity is another example of pipeline expansion as a result of cross-selling activity within our channel that has materialized following our acquisition. These highlighted projects are early in the opportunity pipeline and we expect to close on a few of them in the coming months. Overall, opportunities for the ASIC and IP group has more than doubled year-over-year since Adesto acquired the business last year about this time.\\n\\nTurning now to our embedded systems solutions, since Echelon acquisition closed late last year, we have started to reengage with many of our top customers. We informed them of our renewed focus in the embedded business, and also align objectives and goals for next generation edge devices and edge servers in industrial IoT application.\\n\\nIn the first quarter of this year, we started to realize the benefits of this renewed focus. We saw strong orders across the top 10 customers for existing products as well as beta version of our newly introduced SmartServer IoT edge server. These included customers in the smart building segment, energy management as well as connected commercial and industrial safety systems.\\n\\nRecently, we were pleased to formally released the SmartServer IoT into production. This product is industry's first truly open edge server for building automation and Industrial IoT focus on the critical crossroads where operational technologies, what we call OT in the industrial world, need to breach into the new IoT world. SmartServer IoT supports multiple protocols and applications, enabling the convergence of diverse systems into a single edge networking and compute platform. It features built-in support for popular industry's protocol and services, open northbound interfaces to any remote client, workstation or web application and open southbound interfaces and a data abstraction layer for connecting with emerging IoT protocols and devices.\\n\\nIn short, this products significantly simplifies that task of immigration of IoT deployments, embracing and extending existing legacy platforms. We intend to work closely with our extensive installed based of customers representing over 150 million connected devices including tens of thousands of legacy Echelon controllers, each of these legacy controllers that presents potential upgrade sales opportunity as our customers seek the benefit, power and functionality afforded by the SmartServer IoT.\\n\\nAs I indicated, we've already taken orders from a number of early customers and expect activity to accelerate in the back half of this year and into 2020. Doing our Analyst Day presentation, we discussed the barrier that exists for adoption of IoT in the industrial segment, which is tied to the requirement for backwards compatibility of the massive number of installed legacy systems.\\n\\nSmartServer IoT is the one product that's intended to break this barrier and breached to OT to IT transformation. Equally important, there are a number of partnerships that are required to address industrial customers' concerns for investments in IoT platforms. One partnership - our partnership with IBM and it's Watson's IoT platform is rooted in our go-to-market strategy for SmartServer IoT. As part of working with IBM, we have now become a formal IBM business partner and together we expect to advance deployment of predictive analytics in buildings and industrial applications by promoting a combination of our SmartServer IoT and IBM's Watson Iot Platform, IBM's global scale can provide a broad range of potential customers for us.\\n\\nRecently at IBM's IoT Exchange show in Orlando, we announced yet another partnership. This time with IBM and NXP who demonstrate a powerful new level of security for smart building and Industrial IoT deployment. Our SmartServer IoT leads customers to unlock their industrial data so that they can benefit from the capabilities of the IBM Watson platform such as predictive analytics. On top of that, NXP security solution offers customers additional comfort and confidence as they connect their systems to the public cloud.\\n\\nIn summary, Q1 was a great quarter of execution by the company. The message we enforcing with our customers is that, with our broad portfolio of products and a deep set of design competencies from chips to systems to software spanning from the edge to gateways, Adesto now has the essential building blocks, customers need to develop connected IoT applications and systems.\\n\\nWe are very pleased with our strong start to the new year, with increasing growth momentum across our businesses. We've made a great deal of progress over the past year and have consistently executed at or above our targeted plan. Having, fully integrated our acquisitions and with our team actively working together, we expect 2019 to be a breakout year for Adesto.\\n\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Ron to review the first quarter financial results and second quarter guidance before opening the call for your questions. Ron?\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nThanks, Narbeh and thanks everyone for joining today. As part of my financial review, I'll primarily discuss non-GAAP financial result and I ask that you refer to today's press release for a detailed description of our GAAP results as well as the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. The non-GAAP adjustments related to stock-based comp, purchase accounting adjustments, earn-out adjustments, debt amortization and impairments and other charges.\\n\\nIn a quarter, that is typically down sequentially and one in which various competitors exhibited weakness both in their results and outlook, we continue to execute across all areas of the business. Our revenues were up on a sequential and year-over-year basis and as Narbeh mentioned our outlook for the rest of the year and the first quarter two initial indicators very strong.\\n\\nLet me now turn to the results. Revenue for the first quarter was $28.1 million, an increase of 83.7% over the $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, due to organic growth and contributions from the acquisitions we undertook last year. Revenue was also higher sequentially and exceeded the high end of the range of guidance we guide - we gave in our last earnings call.\\n\\nNon-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 49.4%. This represents the 230 basis point improvement over non-GAAP gross margin of 47.1% in the first quarter of 2018 and an 80 basis point increase from the 48.6% would be this quarter. The margin expansion was due to improved mix from our broader line of high value products as we make meaningful progress toward our goal of 50% to 55%.\\n\\nNon-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were $14.4 million. That's compared to $7.4 million during the first quarter of 2018 and $13.9 million in the prior quarter. We've achieved most of the $68 million and expected annual cost synergies from our recent acquisitions including the wind down of our lighting business, which was non-strategic to our long term focus.\\n\\nAs I stated, last quarter, we will be making other investments going forward in areas that will drive future growth and enhance shareholder value. And these will offset somewhat these costs synergies. Total other income in the first quarter was a negative $1.2 million reflecting $1.4 million of interest expense and $220,000 of other income.\\n\\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net loss was $1.6 million or $0.05 per share as compared to a net loss of $0.3 million or $0.02 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018 and a net loss of $1.2 million or $0.04 per share in the prior quarter.\\n\\nNon-GAAP adjustments to net income in the first quarter include $1.6 million charge related to the wind down of lighting related activities and that's part of the $1.7 million of impairment and other charges, as $0.6 million inventory step up related to acquisition accounting, $1.8 million of amortization of intangible assets, $1.1 million of stock-based compensation, $0.4 million of debt amortization costs, $0.2 million of acquisition related expenses, as well as $0.3 million credit related to reevaluation of our earn-out liability. For the first quarter of 2019, our diluted share count was 29.6 million shares.\\n\\nTurning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and short term investments in restricted cash of $8.1 million. As you know, when we acquired S3 semiconductors one year ago, part of the purchase price was in the form of an earn-out. We currently carry on our balance sheet, what we believe to be the maximum amount potentially payable against earn-out of $10.1 million with the possibility could be less than that amount.\\n\\nThe question has been raised in management, rightly so as to whether the company will need to do an equity raise to fund the earn-out. I can tell you today that's not our plan. Instead of our plans regarding any short term working capital requirements going forward are simple and straightforward.\\n\\nFirst, we're currently in the process and negotiating working capital, line of credit, the amount in discussion today is $10 million and our objective is to close and have it available for use in the current quarter. And secondly, as we have indicated we have a very positive outlook on the business for the balance of the year and expect to reach EBITDA margins of 10% and positive free cash flow.\\n\\nThe net effect of the foregoing is that we strongly believe our existing cash position supplemented by its new line of credit and an outlook of strong EBITDA margins and positive free cash flow is sufficient to meet our current needs.\\n\\nLastly, I want to emphasize, once again that we're a business with a growth outlook much higher than the industry and with a clear path to profitability, giving us confidence that the steps we're taking today are sufficient to continue to fund the growth we've seen our business.\\n\\nTurning to the rest of the balance sheet, net accounts receivable was flat at $23.2 million and DSOs were 59 days, which I expected to decline going forward. Net inventory declined by $2 million or 10.7% to $16.6 million, due primarily the lower levels of memory inventory of certain customers began volume production.\\n\\nOur targeted inventory turns are minimum of 4x and we expect to reach those levels again in the current year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 was positive $12,000 compared to a positive $0.3 million during the first quarter of 2018 and a positive $0.5 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $0.6 million for the quarter and depreciation and amortization was $0.6 million.\\n\\nNow let me turn to our guidance for the second quarter of 2019, we expect revenue to increase to arrange of $29 million to $31 million, that represents a sequential increase in nearly 7% and approximately 65% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. As Narbeh mentioned in his comments, we continue to see positive product and customer momentum in all areas of the business.\\n\\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter is expected to range between 48% and 50%, as we continue to be on track of achieving sustainable growth margins above 50%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to range between $14.5 million and $15.5 million and we currently expect they will remain relatively flat at those levels through the end of the year.\\n\\nStock-based comp for the second quarter will be approximately $1.3 million. Amortization of intangible assets will be approximately $1.8 million and depreciation and amortization will be approximately $0.8 million. Interest expenses as expected to be approximately $1.4 million and weighted average shares outstanding are anticipated to be approximately 29.8 million share.\\n\\nLastly, I want to reiterate our expectation that our second half revenues will be at least 30% above the prior year second half, plus driving adjusted EBITDA margin in excess of 10% and generating positive free cash flow.\\n\\nWith that, we'll open the call to questions.\\n\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike Walkley\\n\\nGreat, thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter. Narbeh, just wanted to ask about the new SmartServer IoT gateway. How's the initial client feedback for those testing it? And with the installed base, how do we - how should we think about the opportunity for that product as it ramps into 2020 and beyond?\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nHi, Mike. Yes, so actually we started to samples on some selected customer even in Q4, but the product wasn't released at the time. Initial feedback was obviously very positive, because we've taken a lot of input from the customers prior to the designing of the SmartServer IoT. And we rolled out a more broad - rollout of the product in Q1. So far feedback has been positive. We've included - we rolled this out also in a diverse set of applications from Smart City as well as transportation. So basically, we've gone into some of our new customers as some are mostly have been existing customers, who have used our controllers in the past before. In turns up the opportunity size, so if you look at the actual value of the SmartServer, the ASP of the SmartServer IoT is in the mid three-digit range.\\n\\nOf course, it's got the different feature sets that defined the pricing - the price book for the product itself. Our intention is also that I've discussed this in the past during the Analyst Day, that we're in discussions with our existing customers to better understand their needs in terms of software and also API that we may be able to attach with every SmartServer, say to the customer as an option for them to acquire. And that hasn't worked out yet, but what that means is that the average ASP for as SmartServer solution itself could actually go well beyond $1,000.\\n\\nIn terms of the size opportunity, I guess the way we are looking at it today as a more tangible one is our existing customer base. We've been using the old controllers as these customers are rolling out new platforms or upgrading, they are our first target customers. And as I indicated, there are thousands of these products out there. We think the installed customer base.\\n\\nMike Walkley\\n\\nGreat. Thank you. That's helpful. And just an echo as Narbeh, if you just - can you update us there just with the new densities, kind of the interest from clients, the overall pipeline there and what kind of run rate could this business hit may be in a calendar 2020 and beyond?\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nWell. There are two sets of markets that we are targeting. It will be one is the fitness tracker like market which I indicated we on the 32 mega and we have other wearable and voice audio sort of applications in the consumer side. And those are in seven digits, just like you can imagine a consumer level volume. On the other hand, we are also beginning to see interest from our industrial customers. These are in home automation, industrial control. What we're saying is very interesting days that's when we first had our first 32 mega EcoXiP devices and we touted as the performance advantages that the customer get at system level, especially if you're trying to be competing at the edge.\\n\\nPeople were interested and they were intrigued about the performance improvement, but somehow they compared the pricing as to compare to a standard commodity a serial flash. And they walked away. While we've seen at least now is that a handful of those customers, the older customers that we sampled at 32 megabit a year and a half ago have actually come back and are actively asking Eco's because they're not able to get at the architect - at the system level, the performance, they were expecting from standard flash products as it works with the microcontroller. So I think that revelation is actually going to expand out as edge computing becomes more pervasive in IoT.\\n\\nSo applications as I indicated, it's in the - on the consumer side, its wearables, audio voice activated devices and in some residential home automation, but also we see it in the industrial market for industrial control card readers and so forth.\\n\\nMike Walkley\\n\\nGreat. Thanks. Last question and I'll jump back in the queue. Just on the model with the higher mix of some consumer projects in the near term. Ron, how should we think about maybe gross margin trending into the back half of the year as you hit your higher margin targets on the EBITDA side? Thank you.\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nSure. So the guide right now is 48% to 50%. I think as you go through the second half, you'll see a trend up as we go through it. Because we do expect some of the higher margin products to start to kick-in in the second half, again, the objective over time is to be sustainable and be in the 50% to 55% range. But our expectations a little tick up in the second half.\\n\\nMike Walkley\\n\\nThank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen. Your line is now open.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\n\\nHi, good afternoon everybody. This is Sam on for Karl. Quick question about inventory and then I have a follow-up. So it looks like inventory days were flat quarter-over-quarter as they have been the last couple of quarters. Could you maybe walk us through how you see that trending through the balance of the year? Ron, I think you mentioned that you're looking for inventory turns to raise up to four times. So I'm assuming that means days are going to come down. So if you could maybe give some color on that? That would be helpful.\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nYes, sure. So yes, days will come down. So as we go through the year, there were - again, I think there's some activity right now getting ahead of some customer ramps, even though it did come down a little bit in Q1. But my expectation, as you get to the second half of the year or Q3, Q4 you'll see turns, which aren't even at three right now, it can go over four. Right? So you'll see days of inventory coming down.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks. And then the second one was a little more dramatic on memory. In the last couple of months, maybe a couple quarters, some Asian NOR manufacturers had made some comments about focusing on higher density products to serve markets with more longevity and more stable pricing such as automotive. Could either of you, maybe discuss some of your thoughts surrounding there, where with all to move into these different products, higher density offerings? And then potentially even whether or not they could create more value-add solutions such as your own data flash or fusion lines that differentiate your portfolio today?\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nYes. So NOR flash is pretty interesting because you have this -we have been indicated the higher densities especially also segment oriented such as industrial and automotive which are less - they've experienced less price erosion as year-over-year. And then the other extreme is also the same, as if you know that those things, 2015, we've been mentioning that. At the low density also you don't see price erosion as much because also there is no new supply that really comes online to change the balance of supply and demand. So organically, Adesto has not experienced price erosion. That's typical in the memory business because we don't compete in that commodity like space.\\n\\nWe take - if you look at our memory products today, the concept of being application specific, basically gardener's two things. One is solutions are more sticky with the customers because customers have typically designed our system to take benefit of some of the advantages we get. And we also offer our customers value in terms of - I mean, just look at the Fusion HD example today, where we've incorporated some content that typically it would be on a bill of material with a commodity memory. We managed to architects the chipped in their way that you can taking some off that contacting our chip, offer a slight price premium. But overall the customer actually wins from a cost of the block material perspective.\\n\\nAnd we've been very good at that over the last several years with any of our memory products. So we don't expect, again to be sensitive to overall fluctuations. That's typical for commodity memory. But in terms of moving into the automotive market and so forth, right now, we are not, we claimed the automotive market by supplying to companies who then supply to the automotive end market. But we as a company, we do not have an automotive grade product yet and we don't have it in the plan.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\n\\nThat makes sense. Thank you. And last one, if I may. I think previously, you've disclosed that embedded systems is comprised of about 60% edge devices by revenue, 30% from modules and gateways with the remainder coming from SDKs and management tools with the recent deployment of your new SmartServer product line. Do you see this changing or being more or less stable going forward and how might this impact margins if there is any change? Thank you.\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nYes, expectation is that - so first of all, that division in terms of margins is north of as a blended margin is - north for a long term targeted model as a whole. But as we move forward, especially in the next year or so, expectation is that you see the first two things, the embedded system division grow in terms of the revenue has we indicated, but also the share of the revenue coming from the edge servers and also software solutions that are attached to the edge servers to grow. So most likely the edge - percentage of the edge will - revenue contribution will come down and the entire margin, obviously, if I look at the margin profile, the more you move up that value chain is higher gross margin.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\n\\nThat's helpful. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you. And our next question comes from Ari Shusterman from Needham. Your line is open.\\n\\nAri Shusterman\\n\\nThank you. I'm asking for Rajiv Gill. So can you maybe talk about your M&A outlook? Are you considering potentially acquiring some more company, Tier 1s that you acquired in the last year? Any color that would be helpful.\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nHey Ari, it's Ron. I think as we've discussed in the past, going back to 2017, I think it's been a program internally in terms of corporate development where we - I think we're always evaluating different opportunities, but there's nothing today on the table that would suggest anything in the near-term.\\n\\nAri Shusterman\\n\\nAll right. Thank you. And can you talk about your exposure to China especially, and you estimated in light of recent event.\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nYes. Sure. When the tariff issue first came up, we talked about - we have very, very little exposure. We do get some embedded product out of China that could be exposed to tariffs, but it's a de minimis amount.\\n\\nThank you. And our next question comes from Suji Desilva from ROTH Capital. Your line is now open.\\n\\nSuji Desilva\\n\\nHello, Narbeh. Hello, Ron. Congratulations on the progress here. So in the memory segments, I just want to understand the gross margin impact there of doing well at your Tier 1 customer. I remember several quarters ago that was a headwind. Of course, now you're more diversified with acquisitions and perhaps you have a richer mix of that customer and maybe more diversification away from that customer. So if you kind of paint a picture of where your margin would be impacted if you do well at this Tier 1 customer versus a past time around? It'll be helpful. Thanks.\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nYes. Hey, Suji, it's Ron. I'll take that. I think the way to think about our margin profile and the business is, since we've been public, we've always talked about memory margins being - the target always being kind of mid to high 40's and that continues to remain the target. I think when you look at the business today, it's about a 60%, 40% split memory in the other businesses and the memory business is in the 40's and the other businesses are in the 55% to 60% range for margins. And if you think about the guide going forward through the end of the year, that would contemplate how we see the business I'm folding through the year. But we're not seeing a degradation or big a degradation in margins going forward.\\n\\nSuji Desilva\\n\\nHey Ron, it's helpful color. And then on the ASIC pipeline, sounds like you're having success in multiple end markets. I'm curious, on the consumer side, whether those are established companies or whether there's a startup companies and whether - I think this was asked before, if the consumer mix would potentially kind of dominate your end market ASIC sales or whether the other non-consumer product will also have robust unit sales helping that mix?\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nYes. So on the consumer side, obviously those are higher volume opportunities much faster time to revenue. On the other markets outside that satellite communication, which has been our strong suits in terms of designing value add at ASIC for that market is lower volume and much more having longer longevity from that perspective. In terms of the customer base, it varies, again, as you know, ASICs are rather sensitive topics because, the product itself is outsourced to other companies, so we don't necessarily are free to talk to with respect to the end customers.\\n\\nBut, if you think about large Tier 1 companies, they typically have their own teams, right? You can think about companies in the Valley, they have their own teams of designers. So those are not necessarily our target customers. Typically our target customers are ones that are making like ODM that are actually making a product using off the shelf components. And going into the volume that are justifies them to going to an ASIC. And then from that perspective, the customers vary across the board in terms of size and shape.\\n\\nSuji Desilva\\n\\nOkay. It's very helpful, Narbeh. That's all I have for now. Thanks guys.\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nThanks, Suji.\\n\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Josh Nichols from B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.\\n\\nJosh Nichols\\n\\nYes. Thanks for taking my question and good to see the company off to a strong start despite what normally is - a typically seasonally slower first quarter. I wanted to ask, could you talk a little bit, you were talking about memory margins before about what the margin profile is Fusion HD relative to some of the other memory offerings? And also, any info you could provide a high level as far as what you're seeing for pricing and inventory levels for the Standard Serial Flash at this point?\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nSo, it's Ron. So a couple things I think with respect to margins, instead of talking about Fusion HD specifically, I think the way to think about the business and what we've talked about is, margins are kind of segmented by end market and by type of products. So, generally standard products are lower than the proprietary product. So, again, for the memory business in general, you want it in the mid 40's range in terms of gross margins. And that's what we targeted, right? That's how we want to run the business. And so that takes into account kind of everything that you're looking at. Your second question was around pricing and inventory levels.\\n\\nJosh Nichols\\n\\nPricing and inventory, yes.\\n\\nRon Shelton\\n\\nYes. So, I think for us, I mean, there's nothing unusual in the pricing environment that you would expect you have seen historically. So we're not seeing that we're seeing inventory levels in the channels coming down a little bit. But again, I think relative to our business specifically, I think when we look at certain competitors, it's performing much, much, much better than others in the same space nor Flash.\\n\\nJosh Nichols\\n\\nThanks. And then I did want to ask of the three different business lines, where do you see some of the most opportunity with the upcoming 5G rollout? And when do you expect that to start becoming a more significant contributor to the company's revenue growth?\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nI think, the 5G rollout is definitely a game changer because now you really are connecting things directly. And we see - for sure the one area that we know we're engaging is with respect to our ASIC group because again, that's an area that even today, one of our activate ASIC projects, not necessarily the 5G, but it's really related to cellular communication broadband to home area. So that definitely you have expertise and are working on that project.\\n\\nI think in terms of the connectivity from an industrial perspective, I believe this create a very good opportunity, especially for our SmartServer IoT. Because the way SmartServer IoT is design is very modular. Actually we should be able to - the platform is expandable to connect to any northbound sort of communication. And if you think about a deployment where you're aggregating data from a bunch of low cost and nodes, that would still be running on some sort of a local network, it could be wired or wireless. That aggregation happens at the SmartServer IoT level and the communication happens at whatever that fits that particular cost and bandwidth model. So I think that creates an interesting opportunity for us. And fortunately the way the SmartServer IoT is designed 3D agnostic to the communication platform being used.\\n\\nJosh Nichols\\n\\nThank you. And then last question from me. So, a lot of growth vectors as you mentioned, kind of coming into play into the second half. And I did want to ask regarding the MavriqCM design win with a camera module maker. If you had a handicap, what do you think the company's odds are of securing another camera module design win this year?\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nWell I don't handicap, but all I know is that we have a pipeline of customers we're engaged with. And again, those markets are, as I indicated in the past, they are extremely fast ramping and they move very fast. So we have quite a several that were discussing. But again, I want to put things in perspective from that line. The average ASP of those - of the MavriqCM is lower, even though the gross margin is decent, the average ASPs are low. So from - being from making the needle move, as a company our size today, the MavriqCM does offer a good opportunity to get into the camera market. It adds to that. But by itself is not the one that we are relying for the second half growth, I can tell you that.\\n\\nJosh Nichols\\n\\nsounds good. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Narbeh Derhacobian, President CEO for any further remarks.\\n\\nNarbeh Derhacobian\\n\\nThank you. Before closing the call, I'd like to let you know that we will be attending the B. Riley Conference in Beverly Hills on May 23. The Cowen Conference in New York on May 29. We will also be in London attending the ROTH Conference on the 18 and 19 of June. Please contact IR at adestotech.com. or the chatting group if you would like to arrange a meeting with us. Thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to discussing our continued progress on our next earnings call. Operator, you may now disconnect. Thank you.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

Absolutely everybody. Except perhaps for the \"villains\" who try to stand in Cinderella\\'s way, but they don\\'t count anyway.\\n\\nIn some way, shape, or form, the narrative just has a way of cutting through culture, age, and gender differences to entice and excite something in all of us. The same can be said about time. We can go pretty far back in recorded history to see the same appeal playing out.\\n\\nTake it from Dictionary.com, which notes how: \"The Cinderella that English speakers know and love can be traced to the French story Cendrillon, first published in 1697 by Charles Perrault, though Chinese and Greek versions of this classic tale go back to the 9th century CE and 6th century BCE, respectively.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s impressive. Most impressive. But I\\'d imagine it\\'s not the half of it.\\n\\nConsidering how the art of storytelling is really just the art of thievery, with authors only ever borrowing basic ideas and inspirations from what they already know, it seems safe to say that there were Cinderella stories that date back even earlier than that. They\\'ve just been lost to natural erosion or human error.\\n\\nWhy wouldn\\'t there be when there have always been people in underdog positions looking for something better... something more significant out of their lives... something more fulfilling than mere drudgery, obscurity or survival at the back of the pack?\\n\\nWhether told in fictional accounts or through real-life events, Cinderella reminds us that there\\'s always room to hope. No matter what seed we\\'re ranked as.\\n\\nPhoto Source\\n\\nMarch Madness Presents Its Own Adaption\\n\\nWhen it comes to March Madness, there really haven\\'t been any viable Cinderella stories this year. Like it or not, the first few rounds of insanity managed to make sense the last three weeks. Boringly so.\\n\\nTop-rated teams beat their lower-ranked competition in one match-up after another, giving basketball analysts everywhere one more reason to pat themselves on the back.\\n\\nYawn and ho hum.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until the Elite 8 that things really started heating up, delivering upsets that so very many experts never saw coming.\\n\\nThose were attention-grabbing games. Make no mistake of it. At the same time, they couldn\\'t really be called Cinderella stories, no matter how surprising they were. The No. 5 seed Auburn Tigers\\' win over the Kentucky Wildcats came the closest to a proper understanding of the term.\\n\\nEven so, in the ancient Greek telling we already referenced, Cinderella was a slave. The lowest of the low. And in the much later European versions - much less the moneymaking Walt Disney adaptions made between the 20th and 21st centuries - the classic heroine wasn\\'t much better off, forced to follow her much more powerful stepmother\\'s every order and whim.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t quite describe where the Tigers were coming from. Out of 16 rankings, or \"seeds,\" it\\'s hard not to see how a No. 5 has some kind of clear competitive ability. Clearly not the most, but it\\'s still in pretty decent standing all things considered.\\n\\nIf you want a true underdog story, you have to turn to past years. According to CBS Sports, \"The lowest seed that\\'s ever won an Elite Eight game and advanced to the Final four is a No. 11, and only four of them have done it.\"\\n\\nThose would be:\\n\\nLoyola-Chicago\\'s win over No. 9 seed Kansas State just last year VCU\\'s defeat of No. 1 Kansas in 2011 George Mason\\'s victory in its match-up with No. 1-ranked Connecticut in 2006 LSU\\'s upset over the No. 1 Kentucky in 1986.\\n\\nAnd none of those teams actually managed to make it to the championship. To get that level of magic, you\\'ll have to turn to 1985, when No. 8 Villanova went all the way to beat out Georgetown in the final game.\\n\\nAs Business Insider puts it, \"To this day, no team ranked lower than an eight-seed has gone on to win the tournament.\"\\n\\nThough that doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t happen in the future.\\n\\nThe future is always up in the air.\\n\\nPhoto Source\\n\\nThe \"Cinderella Element\" You Want to Look For\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing about a Cinderella story. The protagonist in it, whoever that might be, has to have the will to make something more out of itself. That\\'s the first element you have to look for if you want to discount the big guys or gals, and bet on the less loved instead.\\n\\nThe second thing you\\'ll want to look for is whether or not it has a game plan. Where does it want to go, and how does it intend to get there? That\\'s why we\\'re so intrigued by REITs like City Office (CIO), Easterly Government (DEA), and Catchmark Timber (CTT).\\n\\nSource: CIO Website\\n\\nStarting with City Office, we consider this small-cap REIT a solid Strong Buy, with a portfolio of 64 buildings located in fast-growing cities, mostly in western and southern U.S. Management targets a mix of Grade A and B properties that allow it to enjoy average cap rates of 7.3% and that it can refurbish and boost occupancy (and rents) over time.\\n\\nThe key to this long-term value investing strategy is being located in cities with faster population and economic growth, as well as slower new office construction (to minimize the risk of oversupply). Management has been able to locate more profitable growth opportunities and believes that in the future it will be able to achieve about 7.5% cap rates, which will be a big AFFO per share growth driver.\\n\\nLike most new small-cap REITs, CIO has had to grow into its dividend (in terms of payout ratio), which management has been focused on since 2015. Yield is 8.4% (sector median 5.3%), 2019 AFFO payout ratio is 104% (80% FFO payout ratio), Debt/Ebitda is 8.4 (sector average 5.8), and average borrowing cost is 4.1% (77% fixed-rate).\\n\\nThe key to CIO\\'s long-term thesis is (1) lowering its AFFO payout ratio to below 100% (and likely below 90% before investors can expect dividend growth) and (2) deleveraging the balance sheet via tapping into lower costs of equity as it executes on its plan and achieves a higher P/FFO multiple (and thus more profitable growth).\\n\\nWe consider 8% long-term growth to be a reasonable and achievable growth forecast that, even should the REIT never see its valuation improve, would deliver excellent mid-double-digit long-term total returns for investors. If the REIT is able to deliver on its growth plan, then its valuation will improve significantly from its current forward P/FFO of just 9.5. The historical P/FFO has been 12.6 since its IPO in 2014 and even a return to that level would provide a significant valuation boost that could drive long-term total returns (over the next five to ten years) closer to 20%. We maintain a Strong Buy.\\n\\nSource: DEA Website\\n\\nEasterly Government is another small cap that packs plenty of punch. Specifically, DEA is an office REIT that focuses on the acquisition, development, and management of class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. government agencies through the General Services Administration. This REIT is not the only government office-focused REIT; however, the company is the only \"pure play\" government-leased model with internal management. DEA owns 65 properties encompassing 5.6 million square feet, including 31 properties leased primarily to U.S. Government tenant agencies.\\n\\nThe pool of assets that DEA owns is fragmented - the 5 largest owners of GSA-leased assets own 16.0% in the aggregate, as the company sticks to critical missions of the federal government that don\\'t go out of favor - agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Most importantly, DEA\\'s usual tenants are not subject to annual appropriations from capricious state governors and governments.\\n\\nUp until December 2017, DEA was growing its dividend, modestly, but the company opted to freeze the growth in 2018 (maintaining the annual payout of $1.04 per share). This was likely due to the elevated payout ratio, in excess of 100% based on AFFO. The company is guiding FFO per share of $1.60 to $1.20 in 2019, based on completing $200 million of acquisitions (separate from the January 2019 closing of the final three properties), and completing $75 million to $100 million of gross development-related investment in the year. The midpoint of 2019 guidance represents year-over-year FFO per share on a fully diluted basis growth of approximately 4.5%.\\n\\nAnalysts (per FAST Graphs) are expecting DEA to begin growing the dividend again in 2020 and while the elevated payout ratio provides higher risk, we believe that the stable government-backed revenue stream provides confidence. DEA shares are trading at $18.23 (P/FFO is 15.5x) with a dividend yield of 5.7%. We maintain a Strong Buy.\\n\\nSource: CTT Website\\n\\nCatchmark Timber is the final small cap REIT in our \"Cinderella\" report and this year the shares have already returned a whopping 44%. Of course, we predicted this small cap REIT was poised to profit as we explained in November 2018,\\n\\n\"Many analysts and investors simply ignore the smaller-cap names, leaving the gem mining up to the gutsier investors looking to find the next diamond in the rough.\"\\n\\nGiven late cycle economic concerns, we view timberland exposure as a great uncorrelated asset play that most portfolios deserve some sort of exposure to, and it gets a STRONG BUY rating. Harvest volumes are likely to move up incrementally from third quarter 2018 levels due to greater demand from mills. The 50/50 target between sawlog and pulpwood is likely to take a backseat to healthy timber demand due to mill startups in the Southeast.\\n\\nWhile some critics have been quick to blame fears (on timber REITs), that economic sentiment is now firm that the U.S. is heading late cycle, homebuilders have rallied strongly: the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) is flat over this timeframe but outperforming the S&P 500. This is a continuation of a stark trend and we think that the entire group is due for a bit of a catch-up rally.\\n\\nAs the only publicly traded pure play on timber, CTT is in the enviable position of holding its real timberland heritage while trading at a dirt-cheap valuation against its acreage. Also, keep in mind that CTT is the only one that\\'s expected grow EBITDA year-over-year into 2019. This means that CTT is enduring multiple compression where peers are not as style-based and index selling from timberland ETFs have pressured the share price. We recognized the value last November and we believe there\\'s still meat on the bone. CTT shares are trading at $10.11 with a dividend yield of 5.3%. We maintain a BUY (was a STRONG BUY, but we moved back to an ordinary BUY after the Q1-19 run-up).\\n\\nThat\\'s All Folks\\n\\nIn closing, we like the odds of all 3 of these small cap names, but investors should recognize that shares are more volatile, and we suggest maintaining diversification (while over-weighting the SWANs). Also, pay very close attention to fundamentals and especially dividend growth (and the payout ratio). There\\'s always a chance that one of these REITs could become the next LeBron James (yes, my Realty Income article is being published tomorrow).\\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\n\\nInvest with the #1 Ranked REIT and #1 Finance Analyst on Seeking Alpha\\n\\n\"Your articles should be mandatory in High schools and Colleges, as a separate subject on real estate investments.\"\\n\\n\"Always well-written, factual, and very entertaining, and you did it the hard way.\"\\n\\n\"Brad is the go-to guy, with REITs.

Dover, CFA, Executive Vice President, Head of Equities\\n\\nConcerns about where the financial markets are heading are at the forefront of many investors\\' minds. The risks of a US or global recession this year continue to persist amid slowing global growth, trade tensions and worries about potential geopolitical shocks. Recognizing uncertainties, central banks globally - including the US Federal Reserve - have turned a bit more dovish, causing markets to price out US interest-rate hikes in 2019.\\n\\nOur senior investment leaders see a different story unfolding. In this roundtable discussion, they outline why they think some market observers are misguided and where they see opportunities today.\\n\\nTune in to our latest \"Talking Markets\" podcast and hear more from Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group CIO Sonal Desai, our Head of Equities Stephen Dover, Templeton Global Macro CIO Michael Hasenstab and Franklin Templeton Multi-Asset Solutions CIO Ed Perks.\\n\\nKey market and economic topics: \"It seems like currently there is near-complete consensus the United States is going to hit a recession within 18 months or so, but I find it difficult to determine what is going to cause it. The US labor market is strong and the Fed is dovish. I don\\'t see what the triggering mechanism for a recession would be right now.\" - Sonal Desai \"The last 10 years of monetary policy has increased asset class correlations. As monetary policy normalizes, I think the differences between asset classes and company correlations will matter more. This means stock selection will add more value to the investment process. If markets tilt in favor of value, it will lead to a new set of companies leading the markets.\" - Stephen Dover \"US Treasury yields should go higher for many reasons: growing fiscal deficits, rising inflationary pressures, strong US growth and fewer foreign buyers. When that happens, we will likely get another interest-rate-led shock to broad assets. We think investors need to prepare for that risk.\" - Michael Hasenstab \"I think fundamentals remain a pretty favorable backdrop as long as global GDP sustains itself. But we have a lot of transition happening in the markets, and I think it\\'s incumbent upon us to ensure that we can react to opportunities that markets are inevitably going to give us as volatility increases.\" - Ed Perks\\n\\n____________________________________________________\\n\\nHost/Richard Banks: Hello and welcome to Talking Markets with Franklin Templeton Investments: exclusive and unique insights from Franklin Templeton.\\n\\nI\\'m your host, Richard Banks.\\n\\nAhead on this episode: our latest edition of Franklin Templeton\\'s Global Investment Outlook. Despite slowing growth in the US economy, hear why our investment leaders think a recession is not likely near term, and how they\\'re viewing economic conditions in Asia and Europe.\\n\\nPlus, the impact of a dovish pivot by the US Federal Reserve and a breakdown of monetary policy around the world. And, hear how orthodox policy is driving opportunity in some emerging markets.\\n\\nDiscussing it all is Michael Hasenstab, Chief Investment Officer, Templeton Global Macro, Stephen Dover, Head of Equities, Sonal Desai, Chief Investment Officer, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group and Ed Perks, Chief Investment Officer, Franklin Templeton Multi-Asset Solutions. And leading the conversation is Katie Klingensmith. Katie, take it away.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: Thank you, Richard. And thank you Stephen, Sonal, Michael and Ed for joining us. There have been quite mixed signals about global economic activity. Michael, can you kick us off with your outlook?\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: I think, in fact, there have been some recent signals that maybe-particularly in the US-economic activity will be bottoming and we are starting to see some normalization. I think there has been too much bearishness, this view that the US is about to enter a recession, or is in a recession, I think that is overstated. However, I do think there are some growing concerns fundamentally about long-term sustainability-this idea of massive reckless deficit spending, the populist politics that lead to uncoordinated and often volatile economic agendas - I think, put a more fundamental concern longer term. But in the short term, US economic activity certainly driven by a very strong labor market, supportive consumption, I think that at least gives us some comfort in the very short term.\\n\\nSonal Desai: I would say the very short term because there seems to be now complete consensus that we are going to hit a recession in the US by the end of this year or in 18 months. And what I find a little bit more tricky to figure out, in that time horizon, is what is going to cause that recession? Because we do have those strong labor markets, we don\\'t have, by any means, a hawkish Fed-the Fed is very dovish. [High] Energy prices-another leading culprit-not around. Financial stability and asset-price bubbles, that\\'s what we are looking at.\\n\\nEd Perks: You think back to the fourth quarter 2018-both in equity and in credit-that was a pretty big dislocation. And this recovery, I think, has a lot to do with the pivot that the Fed made. Clearly, they are dovish and markets took a reprieve from that and we have seen the rally so far in 2019.\\n\\nStephen Dover: It\\'s interesting sitting here because a quarter ago, the market was saying, \"we are likely to go into recession, Fed\\'s going to raise rates, China trade deal,\" algorithms were unwinding with all these hedge funds and then we have had this big bounce back which seem to be a little bit too pessimistic, and perhaps now it\\'s a little bit too optimistic.\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: I think one of the concerns I have, though, again going into that longer-term view, is that that recovery and risk assets was the Fed being told to be dovish and flipping their view perceivably, like overnight. And you can do that a couple of times, but at some point, the credibility of the institution is at stake and with the very tight labor market, that\\'s good for consumption and growth short term. Clearly, the wage price inflation is now coming through and that\\'s good, to some extent. It\\'s solving some of these inequalities, but at some point, it will be inflationary. And if you have a Fed that is being directed to be dovish in the face of inflation, that draws into question its institutional strength and that to us is a medium-term concern.\\n\\nStephen Dover: Well, from an equity manager point of view, it almost looks like the Fed has three objectives-inflation, wage growth and not letting the market fall too much. This is the issue, is that there is, in essence, been a \"put.\"\\n\\nSonal Desai: And I think that \"put\" though, it goes way back. It started with Greenspan [Alan Greenspan, former Chair of the Federal Reserve of the United States] and it\\'s always been alive and well, and I think it\\'s really interesting. What you just said Stephen, about it being the equity market, I think that\\'s completely true because fixed income markets, we saw US Treasury sell off. The Fed did not respond to US Treasuries, it responded to the equity market. I would actually say that that\\'s pretty dangerous. The Fed should not be targeting the equity market and there hasn\\'t been any very good example of a central bank targeting asset prices and doing it successfully in a way that didn\\'t hurt.\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: Well that goes back to the issue of your multiple targets. And I think that is a problem around the world, is that when you have populist, divided populations and governments and institutions are failing, the one institution that\\'s been tasked with solving everything, is the central bank. The central bank can\\'t solve income inequality, target inflation and target growth. It\\'s just too many objectives. So, I think it goes to the fundamental issue that the breakdown of broader institutions, maybe isn\\'t a problem when growth is good, but our concern comes in the crisis response later. I mean we think back to the global financial crisis [2007-2008], you had coordinated responses between China, US, Japan, Europe, they are barely talking now.\\n\\nStephen Dover: Right, and China doesn\\'t have the ability to come in like it did last time.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: If we look at further out in the US what are you expecting? Would you expect that the growth will continue?\\n\\nSonal Desai: Right now, I think you need something to happen to push the US off its growth path. It\\'s not that we are talking about 3.5% or 4% growth, that\\'s not it. It\\'s just that you need the bursting of a bubble, you need something to shock the US into a recession.\\n\\nSonal Desai: I don\\'t see what the triggering mechanism for that recession. Right now, we don\\'t see it.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: What about globally, Michael?\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: I mean, I think you have clearly seen a moderation in China, but our view there is, they have such incredible control over the economy, over their capital flows, that a domestically led collapse is pretty unlikely. Things in Europe have been turning down. Some emerging markets have begun to stabilize a little bit, but, they have been a little bit weaker. But we don\\'t see this massive downgrade of global growth, as long as the US can remain this anchor.\\n\\nStephen Dover: I think China is probably one of the better examples for the economy. It\\'s not the stock market, right? The fastest growing economy over the last 20 or 30 years, but not the best-performing stock market. And right now that\\'s particularly true because there are other factors going on in China. One of those being that the China market, which has been kept out of the global indexes, is now being included, and it\\'s going to be included to such a degree that it\\'s upwards of half of the emerging market index. So, if I were to look at a place on the equity side right now, I would look at China and some of the changes that are going on and separate that from the economic news that China is slowing down a bit.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: Would anyone like to comment on interest-rate policy?\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: Well, I think it\\'s this issue of being led by the Fed that there\\'s a lot of central banks in the developed world that are probably behind the curve. And I think mostly the US. And I think that is a concern. I wouldn\\'t say the US is becoming an emerging market, but some of the behavior on fiscal policy, on monetary policy are things that we have only usually seen in emerging markets.\\n\\nSonal Desai: And I would say just talking a little bit about central bank policy, turning our eyes to Europe for a bit, there\\'s been a lot of noise about the European slowdown. And I would note that it\\'s slowing down, sure, the eurozone is slowing down to probably around 1.5% to this year, but this is still substantially above European potential GDP [Gross Domestic Product] growth. So it\\'s certainly not a global slowdown led by Europe. Very rarely, apart from when we saw the eurozone debt crisis, has Europe really been at the forefront of the global move in any direction so to speak, and a very easy ECB [European Central Bank] for sure.\\n\\nStephen Dover: So some of that slowdown in Europe is Germany-Germany is very much tied to China growth-so when there is some clarity on tariffs and what\\'s going on in China, that could help Germany particularly in European growth.\\n\\nAnd secondly, obviously there\\'s just a lot of, for equity investors, concern about Brexit and we don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen, we can\\'t predict it-but, we\\'ll know better in the next month or so and I think some clarity will help the markets.\\n\\nEd Perks: And then just to bring it back to the US. I think we have already touched on interest-rate policy in the US and how the market movements in the last six months have been heavily influenced by that interest-rate policy and I think if growth sustains itself, particularly with asset markets performing pretty strongly year to date, I think that\\'s a natural challenge that\\'s being set up or event that we are going to have to deal with.\\n\\nStephen Dover: So Ed, what are you seeing in credit markets, what are you seeing even like going forward in terms of how companies are going to finance themselves?\\n\\nEd Perks: Companies still have a lot of access to capital markets and rates that they are issuing long-term corporate debt at is still very reasonable-higher than where they were, but still very low for corporate-so we don\\'t see much of a challenge there. I think in the more speculative parts of markets, we have seen some challenges in the floating rate loan market, a lot of kind of excessive type of borrowing, maybe, was happening in that pocket of the market that I think corrected a bit meaningfully at the end of the 2018 and has also kind of not rebounded as quickly, still seeing some outflows from that segment of the market. So we expect companies, generally, to remain pretty diligent about their maturity schedules and their overall level of borrowing.\\n\\nStephen Dover: So, kind of connected to that is stock buybacks and companies either financing for buybacks or using their tax gain. I mean, last year we saw almost a trillion dollars in buybacks, heavily in the technology area. So a lot of the support for the public market over these last few years has been buybacks and there is some political pressure on that.\\n\\nEd Perks: I think there, the key is, look, are companies borrowing to buy back stock, or in the case of most tech companies, tremendous cash balances, as well, on balance sheets.\\n\\nStephen Dover: And the other thing with the tech companies is a lot of that is really just compensation, right? That money is going out in terms of stock options or compensation to employees.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: It sounds like we can expect that stock markets may still have some upside and credit markets may still have some upside with economic growth, even if not as positive as last year, still pretty constructive?\\n\\nEd Perks: Yeah, I think fundamentals remain a pretty favorable backdrop. I mean, as long as this global GDP outlook kind of sustains itself. I am not convinced that markets are comfortable with the concept of further rate tightening and a further upward movement in rates. You know, if we go back the last 18-24 months, when we have seen rates make that move up, particularly on the longer end of the curve, adjusting to those short-term interest-rate increases that the Fed was executing the last two years, that\\'s when we have had those kind of bouts of volatility in equity markets. So I think that is something that still remains to be seen, if markets can get comfortable with the normalization of rates.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: Right, and difficult to invest when rising interest rates is affecting many different asset classes.\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: I think it\\'s getting more important than ever, and October of last year really taught us that investors need to separate out beta from idiosyncratic alpha ideas. And to think that rates going higher will never happen again, I think is not only just wishful thinking, but complacency. And so, our view is that we will get another period where, because of decent economic activity and gradually rising inflation, we get that move in higher rates and beta won\\'t perform particularly well and it will really separate out those investors who are identifying unique special company, country situations versus just broad index risk and I think when all markets rise in such a quick snap back, people forget about October. I mean, it was such a traumatic event, but it\\'s never even talked about. People view it as one-off, never happen again. We think actually, probably it will happen again, people should use this time to be ready for it.\\n\\nSonal Desai: I tend to agree with Michael that we will see more Fed action because the Fed actually ultimately has to want higher rates when they eventually get to the next recession. I would say that periods of volatility absolutely have to be expected. It\\'s for us to try and navigate those periods, but they are going to happen.\\n\\nEd Perks: I think that a lot of those points are actually kind of good news, right? Idiosyncratic alpha, that\\'s what active managers want markets to be driven by, not by broad beta in asset classes. And then I think volatility management, we have to be and have clients increasingly expecting that-controlling that volatility in our portfolios is a key element of what we\\'re doing.\\n\\nStephen Dover: And this last 10 years of monetary policy has, in essence, increased its correlation of a lot of asset classes, certainly within equity and tilted growth versus value. So as that normalizes, there\\'s likely to be more idiosyncratic differences between companies in the equity market.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: So higher volatility, in general, it sounds like we are expecting that. Sonal, you also mentioned that we need a trigger to actually get the end of this period of the US and global growth. I think a lot of folks are worried about political risk right now. Do we see political risks right now in the horizon that really concern us from an investment perspective?\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: Sonal laughing might have just answered that question.\\n\\nSonal Desai: I would just say that, you know, if you take at face value what is coming out from both parties in the US right now, you should be concerned, very concerned. Either if you are talking about the complete rollback of corporate tax cuts which had an enormously positive impact on the US regardless of what you think about the rest of the measures, that\\'s one side of it. The other side of it, this trade policy which we can talk about, I think trade policy is fascinating in and of itself. Almost separate from politics because if, as globally is anticipated and wished for, you do get a democratic administration, the one area which probably will get even worse is trade policy which is this populism which Michael alluded to earlier which does give medium-term concerns, right?\\n\\nStephen Dover: But there is this dichotomy with the trade talks. That this idea that they want to reduce the trade deficit, but at the same time increase the fiscal deficit. So as a country, if we are going to lever ourselves, if we are going to borrow all this money, we are borrowing from foreigners, so we are going to have trade deficits. Putting tariffs, one way or another, isn\\'t going to stop-it might reallocate the trade deficit, but it\\'s not going to stop the trade deficit. Fourth quarter of last year, we had the highest trade deficit ever.\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: I mean, I just find sitting here amazing that the only country that has passed a bipartisan budget of meaningful change that will run a surplus over the next couple of years is Argentina. The only country that will embark upon landmark social security pension reform is Brazil. So this populism that Sonal described in the US, I think is a huge issue, but it is happening globally.\\n\\nStephen Dover: But you have made this point several times about Latin America. They are ahead of us in the sense that they went through the populism and it kind of had a short-term positive effect and then it completely blew up.\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: It failed, yeah.\\n\\nStephen Dover: And I\\'d never heard of [modern] monetary theory, the idea that spending absolutely doesn\\'t matter, but now it\\'s in the mainstream in terms of what\\'s being discussed.\\n\\nSonal Desai: No, not mainstream. We won\\'t agree to it being the mainstream.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: Let\\'s go back to trade politics as they currently stand, Michael, do you think that the conflict, for example in the US and China, really threatens growth in either of those countries?\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: So the immediate impact, if you add up all the tariffs that could potentially happen, and you flow that through to GDP, is, I think, I wouldn\\'t say trivial, but it\\'s very manageable. To me, the bigger concern is what drove these trade conflicts. It\\'s a frustration of populations that don\\'t want internationalization. They want to turn inward, which means trade is just one of the symptoms of I think a very difficult political dynamic in the US or in other countries that will manifest itself in fiscal deficits. It will manifest itself in some places through authoritarian control, it will manifest itself in trade conflict, so this is just the beginning of what I think is a decade-long shift towards very unorthodox economic policies and that to me is the bigger worry.\\n\\nSonal Desai: Yeah, and I would just add to that, there\\'s been a lot more talk than action on trade. So since Trump came into power, we have been hearing about the trade war, the war actually never took place. It\\'s been fought out in the press, but, in fact, there has been very little outcome. I think it\\'s far more important to actually consider those other areas of populism where trade is just one small piece of anti-globalization, it\\'s across-the-board, immigration policy. Every policy you look at, there is this inward-looking nature to what\\'s going on and not just in the US, Europe is very close to that.\\n\\nStephen Dover: I think the issue with China, it\\'s really a geopolitical issue that trade is a part of. And I agree, that the whole trade is overemphasized in the press. And I just want to reiterate, my view is that as investors-particularly equity investors-looking forward, you really have to look at China in a way that, in the past, maybe you looked at Europe or something else as not part of emerging markets, but its own area that probably will make some sense to look at and be invested in over the longer period of time.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: You mentioned before that we have to get used to quite a bit of volatility. Is political risk something that you think you can actively manage in a portfolio or is it a separate conversation?\\n\\nEd Perks: You know, I think it\\'s a challenge. And just to be clear, I think a lot of the volatility that we have been seeing more recently, we would characterize as a return to more normal volatility in markets, after a period of really prolonged depressed volatility because of monetary policy and other factors. But I think in the US, we have been a bit surprised just how quickly post mid-term elections, we have clearly launched ourselves into the 2020 presidential cycle. Look, that\\'s going to be a dominant theme in the media until the election.\\n\\nSo, I think that does present some challenges. I think a good example we have already seen a lot of attention, say on health care, on drug pricing, as being a key theme of this election cycle. So I think, fundamentally, you have to think about, maybe not so much what that does to actual results from these companies, but I think certainly, the multiple that the market that investors might afford those equities can certainly move around quite substantially.\\n\\nStephen Dover: Although, it has been surprising, given all the political turmoil, how little the market has paid attention to what\\'s happened. I mean, that to me could be a shock. At some point, the market kind of decides that what\\'s going on politically is important, but it hasn\\'t happened at this point.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: It sounds like there is a lot of different factors influencing the economy and how we invest in 2019. If I can just ask each of you for a sense of what you are most expecting and what you are most concerned about in your spaces in your outlook for 2019?\\n\\nSonal Desai: I would say it\\'s complacency. There is an enormous amount of complacency. The idea is the Fed gave us a \"get out of jail for free card\" forever. The very fact that within days of Powell\\'s turnaround, markets not only priced out all rate hikes, actually, the next rate move being priced is a rate cut next year. I think that, for me, is always very frightening. We talk about the increase in volatility, but clearly there is a not enough if the markets are still not pricing what I think is a very real possibility of additional rate hikes on the back of what\\'s happening in the economy. So I\\'d say that\\'s where my greatest concern would be.\\n\\nMichael Hasenstab: I completely share that and I think rates will have to go higher for fiscal reasons, inflationary reasons, growth reasons, lack of buyer reasons. When that happens, we will get another shock-interest-rate-led shock-to broad assets and again investors have to hedge that risk. And one way to do it is by negatively correlated assets to that, the other way is idiosyncratic unique situations, there needs to be more of that.\\n\\nAnd that applies broadly to emerging markets. We don\\'t even use the term emerging markets anymore within our group because there is no emerging markets. There is such variance between countries, you can only talk about specific countries. So I think variation with that higher volatility is going to go up. So our outlook is actually quite, ironically-there is a negative feeling about some of the state of the world, but for active managers this is actually a very fertile area to take advantage of.\\n\\nStephen Dover: I think from the equity point of view, equity investors have been thinking, in my opinion, a bit too much about the Fed and looking at the Fed in this sort of Fed put. Traditionally, equity investors need to look at earnings and they need to look at the ratio of those earnings. And I think that this last 10 years of monetary policy have really made a lot of investors more macro investors, rather than micro investors and not really looking at the differences in stocks. And just like Michael\\'s talking about, the differences in markets, it\\'s really true in the equity market, as well. And in emerging markets, I have said this now a few times, but I think that they are so different and there are so many different opportunities and the one thing I would look at in separate now is China. And I think there are some opportunities there, not just because of the economy and the growth, but because how the market is being looked at really changes.\\n\\nEd Perks: You know, I think the multi-asset portfolios really blend a lot of these themes that we have been hearing about. I think if there is one statement that I can make that reflects how we are thinking about our portfolios, and this is true kind of generally, but I think more so today, it\\'s how do we prepare for what\\'s next because we do have a lot of this transition happening in markets and I think it\\'s incumbent upon us to ensure that we can react to opportunities that markets are inevitably going to give us with the volatility.\\n\\nKatie Klingensmith: Thank you all of you for your insights.\\n\\nWhat Are the Risks?\\n\\nAll investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets\\' smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.\\n\\nImportant Legal Information\\n\\nThis material is intended to be of general interest only and should not be construed as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy.

[Operator Instructions]\\n\\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Carpino with Rogers Communications. Please go ahead Mr. Carpino.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThank you Ariel and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm here with our President, Chief Executive Officer, Joe Natale; and our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Staffieri; and Jorge Fernandes, our Chief Technology Officer is with us as well.\\n\\nToday's discussion will include estimates and other forward-looking information from which our actual results could differ. Please review the cautionary language in today's earnings report and in our 2018 annual report regarding the various factors assumptions and risks that could cause our actual results to differ.\\n\\nWith that, let me begin and turn the call over to Joe.\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nThank you Paul and good morning everyone. Today I'm pleased to share our first quarter results, which highlight continued strong financial momentum and some breakthrough customer metrics.\\n\\nFirst, let me start with our financials. We delivered strong financial results, thanks to disciplined execution by our team. On a consolidated basis excluding certain items for the Toronto Blue Jays, we grew total service revenue by 3% and adjusted EBITDA by 7%.\\n\\nIn Wireless, we delivered strong growth in both service revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We achieved the best postpaid churn in our company's history at 0.99%, a key milestone in our customer experience journey. Our focus on customer base management and our strategic investments and customer experience are driving success in this area.\\n\\nConsistent with our strategy to drive value, we continue to focus on the quality of customer additions. We executed strong pricing discipline to attract high-quality customers with the best lifetime value. This discipline was reflected in blended ARPU growth of 1%. Overall, it was a quite first quarter for the industry, and you'll see this reflected in our postpaid net additions.\\n\\nIn Cable, we delivered solid growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA driven by a strong growth in Internet revenue. In Media, we completed the divestiture of our publishing business allowing us to focus more squarely on sports and local programming, the key drivers of our Media business.\\n\\nOverall, our Q1 results are consistent with our plans to achieve our full year guidance for 2019. We completed the repurchase of $155 million worth of shares, our first buyback since 2013. This buyback reflects our underlying confidence in our strategic plan and our long-term growth. Between our share buyback program and our dividend increase, we will return over $1 billion to shareholders this year.\\n\\nAs a management team, we remain steadfastly focused on driving growth in our core business and driving the fundamentals that deliver shareholder value. Execution discipline and well-timed investments are the key to our success.\\n\\nLast week, we announced the successful outcome of a very important spectrum auction. We acquired 52 of the 64 blocks of 600 megahertz spectrum. As the country's only national network operator, we secured this key 5G spectrum in every province and every territory. We've entered this auction with a very clear disciplined plan. Our auction team did a terrific job of efficiently purchasing this essential network asset at $1.71 per megahertz per pop.\\n\\nAs planned, we are in the process of upgrading our network equipment nationally with new radios, so we're ready to deploy the spectrum when it is available next year. We continue to make great headway on our 5G plan. Through our UBC partnership, we are trialing smart city applications.\\n\\nWorking with Ericsson, we completed our first 5G connection test in Downtown, Toronto on a 5G-enabled network. We are signing National Master Service agreements with leading real estate partners to deploy small cells and we are implementing our unified fiber plan to power 5G in major city centers. Clearly, through our investments Rogers is ensuring Canadians will continue to enjoy the most advanced networks in the world.\\n\\nIn Cable, our Internet service continues to provide our customers with the best capabilities. We grew Internet penetration for the 15th consecutive quarter. We already offer up to 1 gigabit speeds to all of our customers today and our future DOCSIS road map will support upload and download speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second across our entire Cable footprint. This broadband connection is the foundation of the home and our Ignite platform is built on that foundation.\\n\\nWe are making steady progress on Ignite TV. The feedback from our customers migrating to IPTV platform is very positive. We are seeing impressive results including significantly improved early life cycle churn, likelihood to recommend and average revenue per account. We continue to work with content providers to drive additional integration into their platforms and we have an impressive content road map coming up.\\n\\nAs I've said before, Ignite TV is just the beginning. Ignite TV will deliver a road map that not only connects monitors and secures everything in the home, it will enhance the customer experience. Ignite is about managing the whole home ecosystem.\\n\\nOver the long-term, we truly have a competitive advantage in Cable with our world-leading Internet and Connected Home road map. This fully integrated entertainment home automation and security service will ride on and be part of our superior broadband service as a whole.\\n\\nIn summary, we continue to deliver industry-leading financial metrics, while achieving record breaking postpaid churn. I'd like to thank our entire team for their incredible dedication and commitment.\\n\\nTony, over to you.\\n\\nTony Staffieri\\n\\nThank you, Joe and good morning everyone. Rogers delivered solid results in Q1, building on the strong fundamentals we established in 2018. We delivered results that reflected our focus on long-term sustainable growth and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.\\n\\nStarting with our consolidated results. We delivered steady total service revenue growth of 1% and flat adjusted EBITDA. These year-on-year growth rates were dampened by the distribution we received last year from Major League Baseball, as well as a certain baseball related player transactions in Q1 this year. Excluding these items, total service revenue grew 3% and our adjusted EBITDA grew 7%.\\n\\nIt is worth highlighting as well that commencing with this first quarter of 2019, we start reporting our financials with the adoption of the IFRS 16 lease accounting standard, which is being applied on a prospective basis.\\n\\nThis new accounting standard impacts adjusted EBITDA, primarily in Wireless and modestly in our other business units, but does not impact the underlying economics of our business. On a consolidated basis, this change improved the adjusted EBITDA growth rate by three points.\\n\\nIn Wireless, we reported strong service revenue growth of 4% this quarter. With a keen focus on revenue market share, we delivered a combination of 23,000 postpaid net subscriber additions, along with growth of 1% in blended ARPU and 3% in blended ABPU.\\n\\nAs noted by Joe, our improvements in customer experience and base management were very strong and drove churn down to an all-time best of 0.99% this quarter. Clearly, there's significant economic benefit to our business by focusing on improving churn and this will remain a top priority within the company.\\n\\nOn the subscriber front, although down from last year, we were pleased with our subscriber gross and net adds in the quarter, given the industry dynamics, the disciplined market approach we took and our exceptional churn results. Even in this quieter environment, we're confident we performed well in terms of share of revenue growth this quarter.\\n\\nIn comparing subscriber activity to the prior year, it's important to note that Q4 of 2017 had quite a bit of heightened promotional activity, which spilled into Q1 last year. This wasn't the case this year and in fact promotional intensity was amongst the lowest we've ever seen in a first quarter. Nonetheless, we remain confident in robust subscriber growth for us and the industry for the remainder of the year.\\n\\nOn Wireless adjusted EBITDA, we reported growth of 9%, which reflected healthy flow through of our strong service revenue growth, as well as the impact of the new lease accounting standard.\\n\\nTurning to Cable. We grew revenue by 1% this quarter and adjusted EBITDA by 3%. Our internet product continues to be the driver of growth in our Cable business. Internet revenue grew 7% this quarter, reflecting continued monetization of the increasing demand for data and higher speed tiers.\\n\\nWe remain uniquely positioned to meet customer demand for faster speeds and higher data with our ability to offer Ignite Gigabit Internet across our entire Cable footprint. We reported 14,000 net subscriber additions, down 12,000 from last year, but still reflecting continued growth in our internet penetration rates, as well we were pleased to see internet ARPU growth accelerate from the previous quarter.\\n\\nOn adjusted EBITDA, despite incremental costs related to the launch of Ignite TV, we expanded Cable margins this quarter due to continued focus on efficiencies and product mix shift to higher margin internet.\\n\\nMoving to Media. This quarter's revenue and EBITDA were lower, driven by distribution for Major League Baseball in 2018 and certain baseball related player transactions occurring in the first quarter of this year. Excluding these items, Media revenue would have been flat and our adjusted EBITDA would've been -- would have decreased by 25%.\\n\\nThis decline year-on-year was solely due to timing differences in the quarter related to rights fees expense relative to the broadcast revenues. We continue to operate the best media and sport assets in our industry, with increasing efficiency and you'll see that in the full year margin improvement for Media.\\n\\nTurning back to some consolidated highlights. We invested $617 million in CapEx for the quarter, which increased 2% year-over-year. In Wireless, we continue to invest in 4.5G as we ready our networks for next-generation 5G capabilities. In Cable, we continue to roll out Ignite TV, as well as pull forward node segmentation to recognize economies of scale and ensure that our hybrid fiber-coax network continues to be well ahead of consumer demand.\\n\\nWith respect to cash flow and returning capital to shareholders, we generated free cash flow of $405 million this quarter, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the timing of higher cash income taxes in the quarter, partially offset by lower interest on borrowings.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, we returned dividends of $247 million and also bought back $155 million in Class B non-voting shares as part of our NCIB program. We ended the quarter with a debt leverage ratio of 2.7 times, which is flat to a year ago despite the lease accounting change, which added 0.2 of leverage to this year's reported number, so a healthy improvement year-on-year in substance.\\n\\nAs you saw in our release this morning, we entered into a $2.2 billion non-revolving credit facility subsequent to the quarter end. This additional financial capacity gives us ample liquidity to fund our recently secured 600 megahertz spectrum. We had liquidity of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and have solid investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks.\\n\\nAdditionally, our balance sheet is well positioned with long-term maturities and low interest rates on our outstanding debt. Our weighted average cost of borrowings was 4.43% as at March 31, 2019, and our weighted average term to maturity was 10.5 years. We've had a strong start towards delivering on our guidance this year and remain focused on driving profitable growth in the business, investing in the future, and returning value to our shareholders.\\n\\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for questions.\\n\\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Fan of Scotiabank.\\n\\nJeffrey Fan\\n\\nThanks and good morning. I - let's start with the Wireless - the state of the Wireless industry a little bit and particularly on ARPU and ABPU. I know your ABPU held up this quarter nice growth at 3%, but I guess the gap versus ARPU is starting to widen. The ARPU growth slowed a little bit from last quarter. Wonder if you can talk a little bit about the dynamics around that? And which do you think the market should focus on with respect to how to understand the underlying economics? And then just a clarification on your guidance 7% to 9% EBITDA growth for the year, does that include these baseball transactions or does it exclude the baseball transactions that you alluded to? Thanks.\\n\\nTony Staffieri\\n\\nThanks for the question, Jeff. Let me start with the ARPU versus ABPU question. I think in response to your question, we look at both of them, but clearly ARPU is the more significant underlying metric, which we think is important. It really gets at the true service revenue per customer excluding the handset subsidy that's embedded in the monthly rate. And so that really is fundamental to the economics. So that's the one we focus on. And the ABPU metric is important relative to the COA or the COR that we spend.\\n\\nIn terms of the widening gap between the two, I think what you're seeing is more subsidy embedded in the ABPU numbers. You may recall in the latter half of 2018, we and the industry moved to an additional $200 subsidy on certain high-end plans. And so what you're seeing is more of that embedded in the ABPU numbers. And so that's the primary difference between ARPU and ABPU. Again, it's the amount of subsidy that's embedded in the monthly service fee. On your second question related to guidance, the guidance we provided is inclusive of all our operations and so we included the baseball operations as well for the full year.\\n\\nJeffrey Fan\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks, Jeff. Next question, Ariel.\\n\\nOur next question comes from Tim Casey of BMO.\\n\\nTim Casey\\n\\nThanks. Just wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question on the state of the Wireless market. Can you talk a little bit about - or reflect more on your comments that you said it was a very slow quarter across the board. I think you mentioned, it's the slowest you've seen in a while. Just - and I get the fact that the comps are different because it was a spillover from Q1 2017 into 2018. But maybe just a little bit more about what you're - what you've seen out there in the market? And what your expectations are for the rest of the year? Thanks.\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nSure, Tim. Happy to talk about that. As Tony mentioned, it was a quiet Q1 and Q1 is often very quiet. But promotionally, so for the first two-third of the quarter, it was very quiet and mind you we didn't do anything overly aggressive to excite or stimulate the market from that perspective. We saw things start to ramp-up again near the last couple of weeks of the quarter, and we saw volume start to kind of grow overall at that point. I mean, looking forward, we'll continue to see robust growth opportunity it may not be as high as Q4. Q4 had sort of a 5.7% growth factor, but still very healthy growth overall.\\n\\nThe market usually gets stimulated by a couple of factors either the availability and focus on some iconic handsets that people find compelling and want to get up to go take a look at. Really didn't have that factor kind of playing for us as heavily this time around. And then, price stimulation with respect to data promotions. And again, that didn't happen so very late in the quarter.\\n\\nSo we took every opportunity to kind of focus on price discipline and focus on lifetime value. We talked about ARPU and ABPU a few minutes ago. Lifetime value for us is up 10% this quarter, because of the combination of ARPU, ABPU and then the overall churn improvement as a whole. And those are the underlying fundamentals that are there coupled with the fact that we believe there's still strong growth opportunity in the marketplace.\\n\\nPenetration is still moving from 87% to 120% as a whole. Immigration is still running at about 2%. So those fundamentals haven't changed. It's just the typical Q1 start to the year, largely predicated by how intensive and how busy it was the Q4 period and the Christmas period leading into it.\\n\\nTim Casey\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks, Tim. Next question, Ariel.\\n\\nOur next question comes from Dave Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\n\\nMatt Griffiths\\n\\nHi. It's Matt Griffiths sitting in for Dave. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask again on Wireless. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how much of the low churn that you reported this quarter may have been influenced by just that general market quietness and slowness that you referred to? And maybe, how much was accounted for by the initiatives that you've had underway for some time now?\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nMatt, I would say that the vast majority of the reasons for the lower churn have to do with the base management activities that we've been working on as a company for the last couple of years, and that is taking a look at all the reasons why customers would consider leading us and working hard to overcome some of those challenges, whether it's end of a promotion, a handset upgrade, a particular service issue whatever that might be. The team has worked extraordinarily hard to really improve the customer experience journey and therefore drive a much better churn improvement. You can see that quarter-on-quarter for the last many in terms of the types of churn improvements, whether they have come in busy times or quiet times we remain consistent in delivering on the churn improvement.\\n\\nMatt Griffiths\\n\\nThanks. And one more if I may on the Cable side. There was a slowdown in the kind of Internet sort of broadband net adds. And I was just wondering if this was a slow quarter comparatively year-over-year on that front as well or if you would expect that to kind of pick up?\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nYeah. I'd say couple of things. First of all, housing starts in Canada, we're running at about 2%. I think you've seen the results out there. They're more like 1% in Q1. So there's a little bit of dampening on the housing starts front. Having said that, we're still very happy with the fact that we continue to grow Internet penetration. Internet penetration for us went up 1.6% overall to 55.8%. And that's many quarters now strong in a row in terms of growth in the Internet penetration. So we're pleased with the fact that we continue to grow the portfolio. There will be seasonal periods as well within the Internet business, largely centered around move periods through the summer, back to school, students connecting and disconnecting. It is one of the quieter quarters, but we're pleased with the continued growth and momentum in penetration.\\n\\nMatt Griffiths\\n\\nAll right. Thank you.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks, Matt. Next question, Ariel.\\n\\nOur next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nSimon Flannery\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, good morning. Just coming back to the 600 megahertz purchase in the auction. Could you just talk about what the plan is the time line for building that out over the next few years? And then related to that, obviously it adds some leverage. You talked about the credit facility, but you're also buying back stocks. So just help us think about the shape of the leverage, and what you want to get that back to and how you're going to balance deleveraging versus future buybacks? Thanks.\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nSure thanks, Simon. Let me make a few comments and then I'm going to ask Jorge Fernandes, our CTO who is here with us today to talk specifically about 600 and its value to us and the deployment approach to it and then we'll circle around with respect to the capital allocation question. First of all, we're very pleased with the outcome of the 600 megahertz auction. We walked through the auction with a very clear strategy and a plan. We won spectrum coast-to-coast as you know Simon.\\n\\n20 megahertz nationally and then 40 megahertz in some very specific regions, Southern Ontario being the most critical and which is almost half of Canada's population where we got four blocks. We paid a price consistent with precedent auctions overall and just generally the valuation of spectrum in Canada as a whole. These are 20-year licenses with renewal so very excited about this. And bear in mind that in the history of wireless, there have only been three low-frequency spectrum auctions.\\n\\nAnd we participated in all three and done well on all three and this -- Jorge will talk to the importance of it. We don't see there being another low-frequency spectrum auction in the foreseeable future, so this is a generational opportunity for us to make the right investments for 5G and beyond for that matter. Jorge, do you want to talk a bit about our plans and your thoughts just overall about the importance of the spectrum?\\n\\nJorge Fernandes\\n\\nSure. Thank you, Joe. Good morning, Simon. So for us 600 spectrum is incredibly important and we're very happy to have acquired as much as we did frankly. As you know low-band spectrum is foundational for any network. I mean low band gets seen everywhere in urban areas and over long distances in rural areas. And we've seen that low band does in fact make a difference between a great network and an average network especially in providing a consistent quality across the Board.\\n\\nAnd I mean obviously if we think about Canada and if there was a country that benefits and justifies such spectrum, of course, it's Canada with our very low population density. As Joe mentioned in the beginning, we're modernizing our infrastructure as we speak and so we will be able to get 600 out there very quickly off the mark as soon as 5G gets into place and the handsets become available. And so we'll be able to very quickly provide a wide area coverage of 5G without a huge cost.\\n\\nAnd frankly as new use cases are developed for 5G, low band will work in tandem with the mid-band and high-band spectrum that will become available over time to provide let's say contiguous layer of national coverage and then using the mid-band and the high band capacity where we need for both 4G and 5G.\\n\\nTony Staffieri\\n\\nAnd then finally Simon on your question with respect to leverage I think even after the auction we sit in a pretty comfortable place with respect to our leverage. We reported at quarter end it was 2.7 times, but as I said 0.2 of that is really due to the change in lease accounting standards. So, in substance we sit at 2.5 times on a like-for-like basis relative to previous numbers you would've seen.\\n\\nSo, we continue to reduce that I think year-on-year to help the clip of about 0.2. The spectrum acquisition will add 0.2. So, on a like-for-like basis it puts us at about 2.7. So, again very comfortable within -- we've talked about ranges in 2 to 2.5 and that was based on previous accounting standards. And so when you put all that together, we're sort of within or very close to the target ranges we've had.\\n\\nIn terms of what does that mean for share buybacks? We said we've committed to returning of cash to shareholders. And what you saw in the first quarter is a combination of us putting our cash to use that way as well as being opportunistic with some of the -- relative to some of the long-term values we see for our business.\\n\\nAnd so that will be something that I think we have room to be balanced about going forward, although I would caution that you may not see the levels of buybacks that you saw in Q1. We'll continue to be prudent about the timing and how much but expect it to be well balanced. But again overall the leverage ratio is sitting at a very good spot.\\n\\nSimon Flannery\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for the color.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks Simon. Next question Ariel.\\n\\nOur next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC.\\n\\nDrew McReynolds\\n\\nYes, thanks very much and thanks for taking my questions. Two I guess bigger picture ones maybe for you Joe. On the balance between profitability and subscriber growth clearly this quarter in emphasis looks a little bit more on profitability. But just wondering as the industry overall evolves, is there any change here between how Rogers sees that balance?\\n\\nAnd then second question on the seasonality of wireless loading across the industry. Do you get a sense just based on what we saw with Q1 that that seasonality is shifting or continues to shift a little bit more to the back end of the year or with season -- with Q1 really kind of an aberration in the grand scheme of things? Thank you.\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nGood questions. Thanks Drew. I'd say overall the balance of subscriber additions and profitability is one that we look at on a regular basis. I think you've heard me say before on this call that we're not going after loading for loading sake. There is a lot about loading out there if you wanted. We're really focused on adding customers that -- and the types of propositions that make sense economically as a whole and are accretive economically.\\n\\nSo, it's not kind of one or the other. I think it's really kind of figuring out where is that striking balance with respect to the economics as a whole. I would say to you that it's a question of really being well timed. Every quarter is a bit different from that perspective.\\n\\nTo your secondary question there is a seasonality more than ever in the wireless business. In a lot of ways we've trained the market to kind of focus on key selling periods and then the hardware or handset manufacturers have kind of aligned themselves to those key selling periods.\\n\\nSo, we've created this moments in time where there is froth there's opportunity in the marketplace there's retail traffic. Certainly the busiest period of all I would say starts with Black Friday and works its way through the holiday season and Boxing week. I'd say the next busy season is back-to-school as sort of a key period of time. And then there are some other sort of smaller periods out there in the marketplace.\\n\\nThe market is very promotionally efficient I guess is one way of describing it. The market is very much focused on looking at where is there a promotional opportunity and when is the right time to kind of weigh in look at changing providers look at upgrading handsets et cetera.\\n\\nAnd I think it's prudent for us as leaders to figure out where is that well-timed balance. We can very easily drive and stimulate the market any particular point in time, but that comes at an economic price. And the other day, we're trying to drive long-term shareholder value and that's really underpinned in metrics like continued growth and ARPU.\\n\\nIt's underpinned by churn results, and therefore, lifetime value. It's underpinned in the margin expansion. And so we will weigh that off against growth in customer additions in the right time in the marketplace and save our powder for those times of the year when we really can make a difference in the great customer adds that we had.\\n\\nDrew McReynolds\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nIs that helpful Drew?\\n\\nDrew McReynolds\\n\\nYeah, that is. And maybe a quick follow-up just for you, Tony. You just talked about the IFRS 16 impact, which you've said before primarily in wireless we can take this offline, but just wondering what the actual impact would've been in cable and media? So, however, you want to quantify that that'd be helpful as well. Thank you.\\n\\nTony Staffieri\\n\\nSure. As you said, sure we can take it offline, but a couple of things would be helpful that I think really get at what you're asking. In terms of the total impact I talked about at a consolidated level. And if you look at the wireless results in terms of EBITDA growth, IFRS impact was about half of that growth. And then for cable and media it's almost nothing in terms of growth rates.\\n\\nDrew McReynolds\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nTony Staffieri\\n\\nI thought we were going to do a full lesson on IFRS 16, I was looking forward to it.\\n\\nDrew McReynolds\\n\\nIt would've been my moment.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks, Drew. Next question, Ariel.\\n\\nOur next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige of Canaccord.\\n\\nAravinda Galappatthige\\n\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up to start with on the cable subscriber trends. I know you talked to some of the lower household formations, but I was wondering, the extent to which competitive action had an impact as well? In particular was wholesale a factor with the resellers were active as well as, obviously, the fiber rollout of the competitor. I just wanted to get a sense of the activity in the promotions that would have had an impact potentially?\\n\\nSecondly with respect to cost reductions, I know that IFRS 16 impacts a direct comparison of the OpEx. But I wanted to get a sense of how you see? You've, obviously, done a great job in 2017 and 2018 of containing costs. As you look ahead maybe just touch on the main buckets that would allow you to strengthen margins and continue to chip away at costs?\\n\\nAnd finally maybe, Tony if you can just remind me of the cable CapEx trend. I know you've talked about returning to that 20% to 22% range within three years. Just the shape of that is -- I think what you in the past referred to is, is more of a cliff in 2021. I just wanted to confirm that that's still the expectation. Thank you.\\n\\nTony Staffieri\\n\\nThanks, Aravinda. Let me start to go through with each of them in terms of your first question on cable and perhaps focus more on Internet. Much like wireless, Q1 was relatively slow. If you look at the promotional activity out there it was -- I wouldn't at all described it as heightened, it was fairly muted. Particularly if you look at long-term promotional incentives, the market seems to cut way back on those and more towards three to six-month, and so you see a healthier balance on the promotional front.\\n\\nAs you've said when you look at macro things like housing starts I would say that is one of the big factors that you see within a particular quarter that will impact gross adds and we saw a little bit of that in Q1.\\n\\nSo I wouldn't read too much into the net number in the first quarter for cable or Internet in particular. We continue to see healthy growth in that sector throughout the year. And so that's probably, how we describe the first quarter.\\n\\nIn terms of opportunity for margin expansion within cable, as you said 2017 and 2018 is good execution on cost efficiency, healthy flow through of the mix shift towards Internet revenue and so that came in nicely.\\n\\nAs we said when we provided our guidance in January, we see continued opportunity for margin expansion in both wireless and cable, may not be to the extent that you saw in 2018 but certainly we continue to chip away of those things that improve efficiency and you'll see that continue to come through. And again that will be exclusive of the IFRS accounting impacts.\\n\\nAnd then finally on your question related to cable CapEx, as we said when we think about our business as the natural resting place for capital intensity in the 20% to 22% range where our industry peers sit at, and that is the direction of travel that we have.\\n\\nThe primary items that get us there have largely taken place and the first one being a switch to a much more efficient CPE setup within the home. We've talked about the Ignite platform taking our average cost per home on installation from something north of $1,100 to south of $400 and more and more becoming well south the $400. And so that's already taking place and you'll see that come through in the numbers as we continue to scale up the number of subscribers on Ignite.\\n\\nAravinda, just a couple of comments on the cost side. If you're looking for the categories of where the cost and margin expansion is going to come from, it's all the things we've talked about before, but one, it's continuing to drive improvements in customer service, which improves our ability to deliver service at lower cost, exceptional service at lower cost driving digital adoption, which is going very well for us. We continue to kind of press the gas on more digital adoption for all different types of customer transactions.\\n\\nAs just a matter, if you're looking absolutely at all the various COGS -- costs, whether it's content COGS or device COGS and going after some of the elements within that category, taking a look at process automation opportunities and we've got a whole list of things to leverage automation to drive far more efficiencies. So it's a very real playbook that Tony and I manage with each of the leaders in the various business units and we're kind of working our way through that playbook.\\n\\nAravinda Galappatthige\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks, Aravinda. Next question, Ariel.\\n\\nOur next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan.\\n\\nRichard Choe\\n\\nHi. I just wanted to follow up on the ARPU little bit. Seems like this might be the trough for ARPU on the Wireless side and it seems like for Internet, we could see some acceleration from here. Is that the right way to look at it? And I have one quick follow-up.\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nYes, Richard, I'll talk to both of them starting with the second one. On Internet, we continue to see good momentum. As I've said, we saw the acceleration to 3% this quarter on Internet. And we continue to see momentum that will continue on into future quarters. So you ought to expect to see that Internet ARPU move in the right direction.\\n\\nAnd similarly on wireless ARPU as well, we report the blended ARPU and good result for first quarter and we continue to see opportunity to have growth on ARPU. In terms of whether that will accelerate as we head into subsequent quarters, I think we continue to see good growth. It's going to depend a lot on market conditions, but right now we continue to see that growth there.\\n\\nRichard Choe\\n\\nAnd then, as a follow-up. In terms of the Cable side, in the U.S. we're seeing pressure on video, but a shift to broadband, especially with, I guess, younger or newer household formations. Kind of, what are you seeing up there and how should we think about it? I guess, longer term, are you seeing the same trends?\\n\\nJoe Natale\\n\\nI think we're seeing similar trends, but I think not as accentuated as we see them in the U.S. If you take a look at the TV industry as a whole, cord cutting in the U.S. has typically been almost 2x what it has been in Canada. We've been running typically about 1.5%.\\n\\nHaving said that, we see us drifting closer to 2% in terms of the cord cutting assumptions in our models, but nowhere near what's happening in the U.S. as a whole. I think the important thing to consider is that with our Ignite TV platform, we've got an opportunity to really kind of redefine the game with respect to content viewing.\\n\\nWe're seeing some very good results already with respect to Ignite TV for the base we do have and we're seeing improvements in ARPA. We're seeing major reduction in churn and we're seeing Net Promoter Score improve substantially. We just recently had a very important milestone of 100,000 TV nets in Ignite TV, sort of has ways to go, because it's still a very small portion of our base as a whole.\\n\\nBut we look at the product road map and the ability for the product to adapt to various segments, youth segments, broadband-only segments and we're very excited about some of things that we have ahead of us, so that we can have variations of content viewing approaches form factors and packaging that will suit all types of customers and you'll see that materialize in the fullness of this year.\\n\\nRichard Choe\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks, Richard. Ariel, we have time for two more questions, please.\\n\\nCertainly. Our next question comes from Sanford Lee of Macquarie.\\n\\nSanford Lee\\n\\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Anthony, can I maybe just clarify your comment on company on track to meet 2019 guidance, with 2019 guidance of 7% to 9% growth. Do you mean this is -- you're on track excluding the MLB impacts? Or are you expecting a massive acceleration for the rest of the year?\\n\\nTony Staffieri\\n\\nYes. To help clarify our guidance that we provided is on a consolidated basis and on a stated basis, so it includes our baseball operations. So we're not excluding the one-time items for the full year in achieving guidance.\\n\\nSanford Lee\\n\\nOkay, great. And then, one more on the Wireless CapEx side. I think you may have won more 600 megahertz spectrum than initially thought going into, it's because with Bell dropping out. So does this potentially reduce your wireless CapEx needs going forward for the effect of cell site splitting intensification?\\n\\nJorge Fernandes\\n\\nSanford, it's Jorge. So yes, I mean essentially 600 as I was saying, 600 spectrum alongside our current 700 assets allows us to deploy a very wide area coverage across the country in a very efficient way which means essentially, we can get off the mark with our existing footprint. Part of the modernization program that we have underway already takes this into account. And so we don't have the need to deploy many more sites to provide that coverage. So it's a very capital-efficient way for us to provide a great quality network.\\n\\nWhen you take into account the point you made on the additional spectrum that we have, I mean we're sitting essentially with fantastic assets not just in terms of being able to provide the coverage, but given the amount of spectrum that we have in the low band also being able to provide capacity as well. So this puts us in a very good position to provide a very good quality of network service in a very capital efficient way.\\n\\nA - Joe Natale\\n\\nAnd please bear in mind Sanford that you know as we make the move to 5G, we've also now got very important tranche of spectrum to make that transition happen. If you look at the combination of 600, 700 and 850, it's very clear that that 700 is not going to be available for 5G or tariff for 5G in the short to medium term. And the ability to kind of grow on 5G will mean we won't have to vacate 850 in order to make 5G happen. That's a very expensive proposition to how to vacate 850. And 850 is 3G right now, plus non-VoLTE customers in that particular band. So we've got this I would call it hopscotch spectrum that really will help us to kind of not just to get more capital efficient in driving our performance across the country, but also in terms of making the 5G transition far less painful and far more cost effective.\\n\\nQ - Sanford Lee\\n\\nGreat, thanks.\\n\\nA - Paul Carpino\\n\\nThanks, Sanford. Last question, Ariel.\\n\\nOur final question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities.\\n\\nQ - David McFadgen\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a question on Wireless. So when I look at Shaw's postpaid net- adds their quarter end in February, it doesn't exactly line up with you, but they had 65000 postpaid net-adds, you delivered 23000. Clearly their postpaid net-adds are lower ARPU. So I don't know if we can draw a trend into one quarter, but do you plan to just kind of sit out on going after those lower ARPU postpaid subs and just yield that market to Shaw or Freedom -- sorry or what's your kind of view on that?\\n\\nA - Joe Natale\\n\\nWell we've got three brands, mainly Rogers brand, the Fido brand, the Chatter brand and they all have different value propositions and different abilities to work and operate in different parts of the market. When the market is growing 5% plus, there is opportunity for growth that lives in all segments of the market. But we have no intention of yielding anything to anyone if you want to ask the question more directly David. But at the same time, we're also not going to tell you exactly what we plan to do for highly competitive reasons.\\n\\nWe've been competing in this market since the very beginning. We've been competing with the likes of Freedom and others for about 10 years and I think we've done a very job at it as a company and we'll continue to drive growth. The nets is a one quarter point and to your comment, it's very hard to draw any trend from one data point. I think you look at the last number of years, you can feel that we've done a good job on behalf of shareholders and customers with respect to competitive entity. But thank you for the question, David.\\n\\nQ - David McFadgen\\n\\nOkay. All right, thank you.\\n\\nPaul Carpino\\n\\nThanks for the questions everyone. We have our Annual Shareholder Meeting that we'll be going to. You can listen to it as audio cast online as well you can pick it up at rogers.com in the Investor Relations section and we'll be happy to chat after that as well. Thanks for your time.\\n\\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines.

We have had a lot of damage. We want friendship, not guns.\"\\n\\nSeparated at birth\\n\\nIndia and Pakistan have thousands of years of shared history. Delhi and Lahore\\'s sandstone forts and grand mosques were all constructed by the Mughal empire, and both countries were later part of British colonial India.\\n\\nWhen Britain gave up control of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, it hastily partitioned it into Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan. Hundreds of thousands died in ethnic bloodshed and millions more became refugees.\\n\\nRelations between the two countries have been strained ever since. They have fought three wars, two of them over the Muslim-majority Kashmir region that both claim in full but rule in part. Last month, they clashed over a suicide attack on an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir by Pakistani militants.\\n\\nIn an attempt to maintain close links to Indian-administered Kashmir, Pakistan often approves visas for the Muslim-majority population on the same day.\\n\\nFor the vast majority of people in both countries, however, arranging a visa to visit to the other side is a bureaucratic process that often takes as long as three months, according to half a dozen of the bus\\'s passengers.\\n\\n\"My family is divided: my wife\\'s side is in India, my side in Pakistan,\" said Shoaib Mohammed, a banker from Karachi returning after a month in Delhi. \"The visa process takes at least 45 days and is often extended.\"\\n\\nThough the bus, inaugurated in 1999 by India\\'s then-prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has been briefly suspended over the years, it ran uninterrupted through the last major clash between the two countries that erupted weeks after the launch.\\n\\nNeither has it been canceled over the tensions of the last month, although passenger numbers dropped into the single digits, officials said, a testimony to the huge police operation to protect it.\\n\\nSeveral armed police are always on board - one of whom on this trip snores on the back seat, rifle on his lap.

We can\\'t take you anymore. We can\\'t take you. Our country is full.\"\\n\\nAs Air Force One touched down in the state, California and 19 other states that are suing Trump over his emergency declaration to build a border wall requested a court order to stop money from being diverted to fund the project. But Trump, who ratcheted up his hard-line immigration rhetoric in recent weeks, declared that his move, which included vetoing a congressional vote, was necessary.\\n\\nAlso on Friday, House Democrats filed a lawsuit preventing Trump from spending more money than Congress has approved to erect barriers along the southwestern border. Congress approved just under $1.4 billion for work on border barricades. Trump has asserted he can use his powers as chief executive to transfer an additional $6.7 billion to wall construction.\\n\\nTrump, who earlier in the week threatened to shut down the border over the high numbers of migrants trying to enter the U.S., appeared to walk back his comments Thursday. He said Friday that it was because Mexico had gotten tougher in stopping an influx of immigrants from moving north.\\n\\n\"Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days,\" the president said as he left the White House. \"I never changed my mind at all. I may shut it down at some point.\"\\n\\nThe president\\'s visit came a day after he withdrew his nominee to lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Longtime border official Ron Vitiello appeared to be cruising toward confirmation, but Trump said Friday that he wanted to go in a \"tougher direction.\"\\n\\nTrump, as he so often does, mixed fact with fiction when warning of the threat at the border. When complaining about the Flores legal settlement that governs treatment of migrant children and families, he blamed \"Judge Flores, whoever you may be.\" But Flores was an unaccompanied 15-year-old girl from El Salvador.\\n\\nHe also downplayed the claims of people seeking asylum at the border, declaring without evidence that many are gang members while comparing some of their efforts to find safety in the U.S. to special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a scam, it\\'s a hoax,\" Trump said. \"I know about hoaxes. I just went through a hoax.\"\\n\\nAs the president showed off the renovated section of the barrier to reporters, a balloon depicting Trump as a baby floated further down the border. And as Trump landed in California, the state\\'s governor ripped the president\\'s push for Congress to pass legislation that would tighten asylum rules to make it harder for people to qualify.\\n\\n\"Since our founding, this country has been a place of refuge - a safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression and violence. His words show a total disregard of the Constitution, our justice system, and what it means to be an American,\" said Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\\n\\nTrump has been increasingly exasperated at his inability to halt the swelling number of migrants entering the U.S., including thousands who have been released after arriving because border officials have no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months, and border agents were on track to make 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children, who require extra care.\\n\\nThe southern border is nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) long and already has about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) of different types of barriers, including short vehicle barricades and tall steel fences that go up to 30 feet (9 meters) high. Most of the fencing was built during George W. Bush\\'s administration, and there have been updates and maintenance throughout other administrations.\\n\\nTrump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border, though he declared Friday that at least 400 miles (650 kilometers) of the border barrier would be erected over the next two years. His administration so far has only replaced existing fencing. Construction for that small chunk of fencing cost about $18 million, began in February 2018 and was completed in October. Plans to replace that fence date back to 2009, during President Barack Obama\\'s tenure.\\n\\nAdministration officials had been studying ways to minimize the economic impact of a potential border closure in case Trump went through with his threat, including keeping trucking lanes open or closing only certain ports.\\n\\nBut even absent that extraordinary step, delays at border stations have been mounting after some 2,000 border officers were reassigned from checking vehicles to deal with migrant crowds.\\n\\nAfter the border visit, Trump traveled to Los Angeles for a pair of fundraisers in the deeply liberal city. He was then set to travel to Las Vegas for another re-election fundraiser and an address to the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is backed by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.', 'source': {'uri': 'abc7ny.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ABC7 New York'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/5235291_040519-kabc-6am-trump-calexico-vid.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'wgt': 0}\n",

Capitalism helped Ray Dalio build his investment empire. But in a lengthy LinkedIn post, the Bridgewater Associates founder says that it isn\\'t working anymore. Mr. Dalio writes that he has seen capitalism \\'evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because it\\'s producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots.\\' \\'Disparity in wealth, especially when accompanied by disparity in values, leads to increasing conflict and, in the government, that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right and often in revolutions of one sort or another.\\' \\'The problem is that capitalists typically don\\'t know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically don\\'t know how to grow it well.\\' \\'We are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large.\\' \\'It doesn\\'t take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals, it needs to be reformed.\\' Stay tuned: Mr. Dalio says that he\\'ll offer his solutions in another essay.\"\\n\\nI\\'m reminded of back in 2007 when Pimco\\'s Paul McCulley coined the term \"shadow banking\" - and the world finally began taking notice of the dangerous new financial structure that had over years come to dominate system Credit. Okay, but by then the damage was done. As someone that began posting the \"Credit Bubble Bulletin\" in 1999 and had chronicled the prevailing role of non-bank Credit in fueling the \"mortgage finance bubble\" fiasco (on a weekly basis), it was all frustrating.\\n\\nWhy wasn\\'t the discussion started in 2001/02 when mortgage Credit began expanding at double-digit rates, and there were clear signs of bubble formation? Oh yeah, that\\'s right. There was desperation to reflate the system and fight the \"scourge of deflation\" after the bursting of the \"tech\" bubble. Excess was welcomed early on - and later, when things got really heated up, nobody dared risk bursting the bubble.\\n\\nReading Mr. Dalio\\'s latest, I have to ask, \"What ever happened to \\'beautiful deleveraging\\'?\" And I\\'m not on the edge of my seat waiting for his \"solutions.\"\\n\\nThere was a window of opportunity early in the mortgage financial bubble period for \"statesmen\" to rise up and call out the recklessness of the Fed spurring mortgage Credit excess and house price inflation in the name of system reflation. Statesmen and women should have excoriated governor Bernanke for suggesting the \"government printing press\" and \"helicopter money\" - the type of crazy talk that should disqualify one for a position of responsibility at the Federal Reserve. Fed chairman? You\\'ve got to be kidding.\\n\\nThere was a window of opportunity to rein the Fed in after QE1. The Federal Reserve should have been held to their 2011 monetary stimulus \"exit strategy.\" Instead they doubled down - literally - as the Fed\\'s balance sheet doubled in about three years to $4.5 TN. Mr. Dalio - along with virtually everyone - didn\\'t seem to have any issues. Indeed, an unprecedented expansion of non-productive debt (certainly including central bank Credit and Treasury borrowings) somehow equated with \"beautiful deleveraging.\" It was ridiculous analysis in the face of the greatest global bubble in human history.\\n\\nCentral banks aren\\'t fully to blame, but it\\'s an awfully good place to start. Three decades of \"activist\" monetary management has left a horrible legacy. The Institute for International Finance reported this week that global debt ended 2018 at a record $243 TN. This debt mountain simply would not have been possible without \"activist\" central banking. Despite a lengthening list of risks, global stocks have powered higher in 2019 to near all-time highs. A relentless speculative bubble has only been possible because of central bank policies.\\n\\nI\\'m not all that interested in Dalio\\'s \"solutions.\" In my mind, he missed what was an exceptional opportunity for statesmanship. Bridgewater\\'s investors were the priority and have been rewarded handsomely. Pro-central bank \"activism\" has been the right call for compounding wealth for the past decade (or three). But no amount of ingenuity will resolve the historic predicament the world finds itself in today. Markets are broken, global imbalances the most extreme ever, and structural impairment unprecedented - and worsening, all of them.\\n\\nMost regrettably, the type of structural reform required will only arise from a severe crisis. The Fed and global central bankers have been reflating bubbles for more than three decades. Highly speculative global markets at this point completely disregard risk. And with borrowing costs incredibly low, what government (ok, Germany) is going to impose some spending discipline and operate on a fiscally responsible trajectory? At this point, finance is hopelessly unsound - and, importantly, hopelessly destructive on an unprecedented global scale.\\n\\nI had the great pleasure of spending part of my Friday with the University of Oregon Investment Group. I gave a talk, \"Money, Credit, Inflation and the Markets.\" Being with bright, intellectually curious and enthusiastic university students gives me hope - and a smile.\\n\\nFrom my presentation: \"It just breaks my heart to see young people turn away from Capitalism. I anticipate spending the rest of my life trying to explain that the culprit is unsound finance and deeply flawed monetary management - and not the system of free-market Capitalism. History teaches us that credit is inherently unstable. I would argue that the experiment in New Age unfettered credit - with its serial booms and busts - evolved into a failed experiment in \"activist\" monetary management - another debacle in \"inflationism.\"\\n\\n\"The result has been a period of historic bubbles - in the markets and in economies - on a global scale. And protracted bubbles become powerful mechanisms of wealth redistribution and destruction. Central banks readily creating new \"money\" and favoring the securities markets are fundamental to the problem. Such policies benefit the wealthy and worsen inequality. We\\'re witnessing the resulting rise of populism and a mounting crisis of confidence in our institutions. Even with 3.8% unemployment, near-record stock prices and one of the longest economic expansions on record, our country is deeply divided and resentful. I fear for the next downturn.\"\\n\\nA Friday Business Insider headline: \"Hedge-fund billionaire Ray Dalio says the current state of capitalism poses \\'an existential threat for the US\\'\"; Barron\\'s: \"Hedge Fund Billionaire Ray Dalio Says Capitalism \\'Must Evolve or Die\\'\"; and Vanity Fair: \"Billionaire Hedge-Fund Manager Warns a \\'Revolution\\' is Coming.\" Observer: \"Ray Dalio on Capitalism Gone Wrong: America May See Dire Consequences.\" And CBS: \"Billionaire Investor Ray Dalio: Capitalism Run Amok is \\'Economically Stupid\\'\"\\n\\nI\\'m reminded of an analogy I\\'ve used in the past. One could make a reasonable argument that our eyeballs are flawed. How could something of such importance be so soft, delicate and vulnerable? Yet this vital organ is not flawed - imperfection is not a legitimate issue. It is the nature of its function that dictates its characteristics and vulnerabilities. Our eyes cannot sit within a protective ribcage like the heart, or within the hardened skull as the brain does.\\n\\nTo be able to see the world - looking at distant mountain ranges and then immediately shifting focus to the pages of a wonderful book - requires an exquisitely complex organ functioning exposed to the elements and largely unprotected. Importantly, we recognize and accept our eyes\\' sensitivities and vulnerabilities. We would not wander into a metal shop without wearing protective eye coverings. We don sunglasses on bright days - darkened snow goggles for spring skiing. We learn at a very young age not to stare into the sun.\\n\\nI disagree with the increasingly popular view that Capitalism as flawed. At the same time, I have been long frustrated by those dogmatically preaching the virtues of Capitalism without accepting the reality of inherent delicacy, vulnerabilities and weaknesses. As we are with our eyes, we have to be on guard, take precautions, and definitely avoid doing anything stupid. Who is reckless with their eyes? There\\'s too much to lose. No one wants to contemplate being blind for the rest of their life.\\n\\nHow could we ever have allowed Capitalism to be so irreparably damaged? There are innate instabilities in Credit and finance that have been disregarded for way too long. Unsound \"money\" is a primary (and insidious) risk to capitalistic systems. I would further argue that persistent asset inflation and recurring speculative bubbles pose a major risk to sound finance and, as such, to Capitalism more generally. Moreover, inflationism - \"activist\" central banking - with its asset market focus, manipulation and nurturing of speculative excess and inequality, is anathema to free-market Capitalism.\\n\\nWhen the Fed slid down the slippery slope and implemented QE, the economics profession and investment community failed society. The case against QE shouldn\\'t have been primarily focused on inflation risk. The overarching danger was a corrosive impairment of markets and finance, with resulting dysfunction for Capitalism more generally. The risk was destabilizing inequality, insecurity and resulting societal stress. There was the peril of a fragmented society, divided nation, political dysfunction and waning trust in our institutions. Somehow, everyone was content to ignore the reality that unsound \"money\" reverberates throughout the markets, the economy, society, politics and geopolitics.\\n\\nOver the years, I\\'ve referred to the \"first law of holes.\" If you find yourself in a hole, the first requirement is to stop digging. Similarly, I\\'ve repeatedly noted the long-ago recognized issue with discretionary monetary management: One mistake invariably leads to only bigger mistakes. And I\\'m fond of reminding readers that \"things turn crazy at the end of cycles.\" Historic cycle, historic \"crazy.\" And I\\'ll repeat what I\\'ve written many times before: From my analytical perspective, things continue to follow the worst-case scenario.\\n\\nIt was yet another mistake for the Fed to go full U-Turn dovish. It was another blunder for the global central bank community to signal they were willing to move quickly and aggressively to bolster international markets. The 2019 speculative run in the markets only exacerbates underlying fragilities - worsens inequality - and sets the stage for an only deeper crisis.\\n\\nI\\'ll be curious to see if Ray Dalio\\'s \"solutions\" include having the Fed disavow aggressive monetary stimulus, while letting markets begin functioning on their own. The biggest problem with Capitalism these days is that the system is not self-adjusting and correcting. Structurally distorted markets and deeply maladjusted economies are incapable of correction. Global imbalances only worsen every year. Speculative bubbles inflate further.\\n\\nGlobal central banks are understandably distressed about the potential for market dislocation and crisis. Yet recurring efforts to forestall upheaval increasingly risk financial collapse. There is no real solution until deeply flawed monetary management is recognized and changed. The current course will only exacerbate inequality and foment Dalio\\'s \"revolution.\" Any soul-searching and scrutinizing of Capitalism must begin with central banking and monetary mismanagement. Where were the likes of Dalio, Dimon and Buffett when it could have made a difference? Faux Statesmanship.\\n\\nFor the Week\\n\\nThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% (up 15.4% y-t-d), and the Dow gained 1.9% (up 13.3%). The Utilities slipped 0.2% (up 10.3%).

An occasional reminder of the grim lessons of history is therefore useful, and no more so than in private equity.

The Federal Reserve meets and will update its forecasts and guidance. The British House of Commons may vote for a third time on the Withdrawal Bill before Prime Minister May heads to the EU Summit to ask for an extension of the UK leaving the EU. The eurozone sees the flash March PMI with great hope that the green shoots of spring will be evident.\\n\\nFOMC\\n\\nThere is little chance of a change in policy at the FOMC meeting. The meeting is important because the Fed's verbal communication has changed dramatically since the December projections. The Fed's thinking about its balance sheet has also evolved. Often officials make small incremental changes to their forecast, but it could be a step function this time.\\n\\nThat said, the Fed's view of the economy has probably not changed materially. The economy hit a soft patch at the end of last year and early this year as various crosscurrents hit, but the underlying fundamentals remain firm. Financial conditions tightened dramatically, but have eased nearly as quickly. The S&P 500 is up over 12% since the start of the year. The Federal Reserve's real broad trade-weighted dollar index fell in both January and February to snap an 11-month rally. US interest rates remain below Q4 '18 levels. The 10-year note yield was near 3.25% in early November and finished last week below 2.60% for the first time since early January. The two-year yield closed the week a little above 2.40%. It peaked shy of 3.0% four months ago.\\n\\nIn December, the median forecast for growth this year was shaved to 2.3% from 2.5%. The median dot for 2020 and 2021 was unrevised at 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively. Like many private sector economists, officials will likely recognize that the economic weakness in Q1 may be more pronounced than anticipated and could trim their forecasts again.\\n\\nGrowth forecasts need to be understood within the context of what is seen as the long-term prospects, which are understood as trend growth. The range of forecasts in December was 1.7% to 2.2% (in September it was 1.7% to 2.1%), so the median projection at the end of last year was for a little more than trend growth. The new update will put it back into the range. A forecast below the range would be understood as a dovish signal, of course, but the variable lag times, even projections of growth in the future years below the range of the long-term forecasts would impact the trajectory of policy.\\n\\nFederal Reserve Chair Powell indicated that he would like to see inflation accelerate before resuming the tightening cycle. In December, the median forecast for both the headline and core PCE deflator was pared to 0.1% to 1.9% and 2.0%, respectively. The 2020 and 2021 median headline forecast did not change. It remained at 2.1% for both years, while the median core forecast slipped 0.1% to 2.0% for both years. Core inflation readings have been soft and market measures of inflation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the 10-year breakeven (spread between the conventional Treasury securities and inflation-linked instruments) has risen by about 20 bps from late last year to 1.93%. The two-year breakeven shot up from around 65 bps last December and early January to 1.985%. The University of Michigan survey of 5-10 year inflation expectations bounced between 2.4% and 2.6% last year and fell to 2.3% in February, matching the cyclical low set at the end of 2016. The preliminary March estimate jumped back into the range at 2.5%.\\n\\nDiscussions of the dramatic drop in equities and yields in Q4 '18 often do not include the collapse in oil prices from around $75 WTI and $85 Brent in late September/early October to $43 and $50, respectively, by the end of 2018. Both have rallied more than 35% off the lows. Fed officials also see tighter labor markets this year, with the median forecast for the unemployment rate to fall to 3.5% this year. It stood at 3.9% in December and last month was at 3.8%.\\n\\nIn December, two of the seventeen officials anticipated that no hikes were necessary this year. It is easy to see how the four officials that saw one hike could join the stand pat camp. Eleven Fed officials had foreseen the need for two or more rate increases, almost evenly divided (6/5 in favor of three). It seems unreasonable to expect them all to completely reverse themselves. The median forecast will still likely anticipate a hike. The market is not there. The January 2020 fed funds futures contract implies a 2.30% average effective rate. It is currently at 2.40%.\\n\\nThe FOMC statement may not contain detail about its balance sheet plans. Powell mostly likely will in his remarks and the media will press as well. Generally speaking, the market has understood the Fed to say that the balance sheet unwind is likely to be completed this year (many expect late Q3 or early Q4). Issues of the duration of the portfolio or how to transition to Treasuries may not have been resolved yet. The Fed's balance sheet was shrinking when the equities rallied in middle quarters of 2018 and when it sold off in Q4 '18 and rallied in Q1 '19, making a causal relationship improbable.\\n\\nBrexit and the EU Summit\\n\\nThe strongest majority in the UK House of Commons was to reject the Withdrawal Bill negotiated by the Tory government and the EC. There is only one way it will pass, and that is for the alternatives to be perceived as worse. May has framed the issue as ultimately a choice between the Withdrawal Bill, leaving with no agreement, and not leaving at all.\\n\\nThe stark choice facing Parliament on Tuesday is to accept the Withdrawal Bill or put the length of the extension in the EC's hands. Assuming the House of Commons is still not persuaded, May will go to the EU Summit and admit that the UK is not quite ready to leave, thank you. She will have to explain why an extension is needed and what the UK will do during the extension.\\n\\nOne would think that if Parliament can vote on the same measure three or four times, surely a second popular referendum is not some abridgment of democracy. Even though Labour formally endorses a second referendum, it largely voted against the very thing last week, as did an overwhelming majority. The bar to a second referendum still appears high. May will not be telling the other heads of state that she needs more time to hold a second referendum. Nor is she likely to announce snap elections.\\n\\nIt is not clear what a short delay will accomplish. European Council President Tusk has advocated a longer extension. It is not clear what a long delay will accomplish. It prolongs the uncertainty for businesses. Time is not the real problem. It is that the UK seems to know what it does not want, like immigration and unelected officials in Brussel making rules, but it does not know what it does want. And to the extent it knows what it wants, it is to have its cake and eat it too, reaping the benefits of a community without any of its subordination of interests.\\n\\nThe Withdrawal Bill will likely get more support in the third attempt than it got in the first two. Many Brexiters, encouraged by the Prime Minister will view a long delay as a Trojan Horse for an eventual reversal. The vote will cast as a reenactment of the referendum. Leave with the Withdrawal Plan or don't leave.\\n\\nOne may be forgiven for thinking the third defeat would surely kill the Withdrawal Bill. There may be the fourth incarnation. After the European Council offers its extension, then the final vote on the Withdrawal Bill can be held. At the same time, in order to continue to control the process, May ceded to Parliament the right to debate alternatives, such as a Norway-styled relationship that would still allow the UK full access to the half a billion consumer bloc.\\n\\nCurrent volatility suggests a range for sterling next week, between roughly $1.30 and $1.36. One-week implied volatility finished the week a little below 16%. The 100-day moving average is 10.50%, putting the current level a little more than two standard deviations above it.\\n\\nEMU Flash PMI\\n\\nThe European Central Bank recently chopped this year's growth forecast by a third to 1.1% (from 1.7%) and warned that risks were still on the downside. Did they overreact? Investors did. They panicked in Q4 '18, driving the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 down around 12.25% and pushing it back up almost 13% so far here in Q1.\\n\\nThe flash Markit March PMIs will be reported at the end of the week. The composite reading will likely improve for the second consecutive month. The composite rose in only three months last year. If it did rise in March, it would be the first back-to-back increase since November and December 2017. In February, it stood at 51.9. It averaged 52.3 in Q4 '18 and 54.6 for the whole year.\\n\\nThe German manufacturing sector has been hit by both domestic (diesel engine reliance) and foreign (slowing of China) shocks. The manufacturing PMI fell every month last year but July. It fell below the 50 boom/bust level in January and fell further in February. March may be the first increase since last July, but it may still be below 50. The same general pattern holds for EMU's manufacturing PMI except that it slipped below 50 only in February.\\n\\nThe eurozone service PMI has fared better as it is less sensitive to the global slowdown and trade disruption. It rose six times last year and was unchanged once. The service PMI peaked January 2018 at 58 and trended lower to 51.2 in December 2018 and January 2019. It rose to 52.8 in February, which matches the Q4 '18 average. It seems to be a bit exaggerated. It is the largest gain since February 2016.\\n\\nThe euro has retraced the ECB-induced losses in full. It had finished the night before the ECB meeting a little above $1.1305 and closed last week a touch above $1.1320. On the back of disappointing US industrial production and an unexpected decline in February manufacturing output, the euro reached almost $1.1345, its best level since March 4. We anticipate additional gains into the $1.1400-$1.1420 area in the coming days. With one-week volatility a little above 5%, the implied range would be around $1.1230 to $1.1430.\\n\\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.\", 'source': {'uri': 'seekingalpha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Seeking Alpha'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'marc_chandler@seekingalpha.com', 'name': 'Marc Chandler', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2, 'wgt': 0}\n",

But a renewed push across the country to allow them to get driver\\'s licenses resonates strongly among those who make their living in the rural crop fields, dairy farms and fruit orchards where the need for everyday transportation can be the greatest.\\n\\nApple orchard worker Eladio Beltran, who is facing deportation after a traffic stop, says licenses also could alleviate the constant fear workers like him live under.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t feel safe,\" Beltran said. \"If you are in a vehicle and you see a cop, you know any time he can turn his lights on.

They are now targeting roughly a half-dozen states where they see a friendlier political landscape this year. That includes Wisconsin and New Jersey, where Democratic governors succeeded Republicans, and New York, where Democrats now are in total control of the Legislature.\\n\\n\"Now there\\'s a new urgency to really try to get this done, and there is new political opportunity,\" said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant advocacy group based in Milwaukee.\\n\\nThe laws could give state-level protection to immigrants who fear more aggressive enforcement by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration. Bolstering those fears is the impending departure, announced over the weekend, of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen , who had been viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by Trump and his aides.\\n\\nAdvocates say police would still be able to view drivers\\' past infractions, but they say immigrants producing a valid license will be less likely to face further questions and contact with federal agents.\\n\\nIn New York, farmworkers make up only about 10,000 of the estimated 265,000 immigrants without legal documents expected to get driver\\'s licenses, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. But they might get the most use out of licenses.\\n\\nIsmael Castellanos is driven a mile daily from the home he shares with four other immigrant workers to the dairy farm where he cares for calves. Trips for a carton of milk or a dozen eggs can be more problematic, and pricey. The nearest grocery store is 8 miles away, and he pays people with cars between $30 and $40 per trip.\\n\\n\"You have to call the person and ask which afternoon he has off so he can drive you, so you do grocery shopping that day,\" Castellanos said in Spanish.\\n\\nCastellanos, Beltran and Jiménez spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that names of the farms where they work are not disclosed. They are part of a group called Alianza Agricola, which is lobbying for the license law in New York.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear whether attitudes have changed much in New York since 2007, when then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer attempted to adopt such a license measure but was forced to back off amid withering political opposition. A poll from Siena College last month found New York residents still opposing the idea by almost 2 to 1.\\n\\nState Sen. Daphne Jordan argues the law would lead to voter fraud, bank fraud and identity theft. The Albany-area Republican said an online petition she started found similarly strong opposition.\\n\\n\"If they want to stay here, then they should become citizens,\" Jordan said. \"We have a system in our country. And it\\'s there for a reason. And so just follow the system and be here legally, and that\\'s the answer to all of it.\"\\n\\nAdvocates say the bill will help the state, as well as immigrants, thanks in part to additional revenue from car registrations and sales taxes. As immigrants register cars, they will buy insurance. They also point to a study that found states with license laws average lower traffic fatality rates, presumably because the immigrant drivers have passed state-administered driving exams.\\n\\n\"Not only does it protect the undocumented immigrant farmer who is harvesting our products, our agricultural products, but it protects society as a whole,\" said sponsoring state Sen. Luis Sepulveda, a Bronx Democrat.\\n\\nBeltran said he faced possible deportation after being stopped for speeding in 2014 as he was driving to buy bronchitis medicine for one of his daughters. The local police notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said it administratively halted his immigration proceedings in 2016 on humanitarian grounds.\\n\\nThen in 2017, local police stopped him for driving the wrong way down a one-way street, according to federal officials. Beltran said he was driving to a gas station in an unfamiliar town. Police called Customs and Border Patrol officers, who arrested Beltran because of his reentry after a 2008 deportation.

Jackson\\'s iconic frames. Nina Roberts\\n\\nA hilly, residential Staten Island neighborhood is where Max Shustovskiy, an immigrant from Siberia, designs and handcrafts eyeglasses. A house with a steep staircase is the headquarters for Shustovskiy\\'s company Bird & Cage, a one-man operation that makes handcrafted eyeglasses, from start to finish.\\n\\nHe shares the home with his wife, Gala, a dog and a cat. Pieces of machinery -- small drills, a jeweler\\'s hot press, various sanders -- are scattered around the home office, kitchen, back porch and basement, there\\'s even a make-shift studio for photographing his frames on the top floor. Shustovskiy can be seen designing at his desk or parading around the machines in a maroon suede apron and a white head device with magnifiers.\\n\\nSubscribe to Observer\\'s Business Newsletter\\n\\nBird & Cage was launched in 2014. The designs are reminiscent of those popular in the 1960s, worn by Yves Saint Laurent or Marcello Mastroianni, but with a contemporary touch. Nearly all of Shustovskiy\\'s chunky frames are made of buffalo horn, a naturally luminous, striated material.\\n\\nThe frames are not cheap. Ready-to-wear frames start at $1,500 and are sold at high-end boutiques like Selima Optique in New York City. Shustovskiy\\'s custom eyeglasses cost more.\\n\\nAmid walls in dark, rich hues, on massive leather sofas, Shustovskiy with his wife Gala, who sometimes helps with Russian-English translations, explained why he immigrated to New York City in 2003, how his Soviet-era skills help him produce eyeglasses today and how actor Samuel L. Jackson began wearing Bird & Cage frames.\\n\\nWhy did you start handcrafting glasses and launch Bird & Cage?\\n\\nI had been working at Alain Mikli making lenses as a lab technician. When Alain Mikli was bought by a conglomerate [Luxottica in 2013], I decided to go out on my own.\\n\\nOh, was that scary, to suddenly be an entrepreneur?\\n\\nNo, I had already been thinking of doing something else. I was a little tired of cutting lenses. Now, my focus is the frames, not lenses. However, I sometimes make lenses for particular clients.\\n\\nSamuel L. Jackson wears your eyeglasses, how did that come about?\\n\\nI cut his lenses at Alain Mikli, we had a good, professional rapport. After I left Alain Mikli, through his assistant, I was eventually able to show him my new collection. I had two trays, maybe 36 pairs of glasses. We [with Gala] were thinking he would maybe like one pair. But he said, \"Oh my God, I like them so much,\" when he tried on a pair. He ended up picking 12 pairs. We could not have even imagined this would happen.\\n\\nSamuel L. Jackson wears a bespoke pair of horn eyeglasses handcrafted by Max Shustovskiy at the CinemaCon Big Screen Achievement Awards on April 26, 2018. Ethan Miller/Getty Images for CinemaCon\\n\\nBacking up, you grew up in Siberia?\\n\\nI grew up in Omsk, Siberia. It\\'s close to the Kazakhstan border, relatively speaking.\\n\\nDid you study eyeglass construction there?\\n\\nNo, I studied engineering. But it was the 1990s, a very crazy time because of perestroika. I had to stop studying and start working to earn money to support my younger brother, mother, grandmother. Studying at the university was not feeding the family.\\n\\nAt that time, factories started to close, manufacturing stopped and all engineers, people with advanced degrees, didn\\'t know what to do. My father gave me some advice, \"Just take a specialization that will let you survive. Hopefully, times will change and then you can figure out what to do.\"\\n\\nPeople need glasses all the time.\\n\\nA pragmatic decision.\\n\\nYes, I got a job at the first private optical store in the city.\\n\\nThis was post-perestroika?\\n\\nOf course! You couldn\\'t do it before; all optical stores were government owned. I learned how to cut lenses by hand, sanding the edges on a wheel. Water dripped on that stone, so I had to wear a huge costume to protect myself from all the flying debris.\\n\\nNowadays, if you go to any optical store, you cannot find a person who can cut lenses by hand, it\\'s all done by machine.\\n\\nDid learning the basics of lens making help you with your current business?\\n\\nAbsolutely. People like me, we know the business, from A [to Z]. If I know a person\\'s prescription, then I know which frames will not work at all. If a client wants bespoke frames, I can design the frame that will fit them best, whether it\\'s thickness of the lenses or the shape of the face or the nose.\\n\\nAre you the only person in New York City crafting eyeglasses by hand?\\n\\nThere is one other guy making glasses, he is originally from Tennessee. I think he recently moved here.\\n\\nMany of your glasses are made out of buffalo horn.\\n\\nIt\\'s a beautiful material. At first, I tried making glasses from African wood, but after experimenting with horn, I kept working with that. Since it\\'s natural, each pair of glasses has its own unique pattern. You don\\'t know what colors may appear during work, so results vary. It\\'s sourced ethically from meat factories in India; the horns are considered waste, a byproduct, they\\'d be thrown out. I also use acetate, or the two materials combined.\\n\\nRight now, Bird & Cage is just you, sometimes Gala. Are you going to eventually ramp up Bird & Cage production?\\n\\nNo. I would have to hire people, produce a line... get robots that can make a lot of frames. I earn enough money to live now, and I\\'m doing what I like. I can\\'t become super rich doing this, never.\\n\\nOh, refreshing. Everyone wants to \"scale,\" manufacture cheaply, quickly mass produce, offer lower priced products, make money. I\\'m thinking Warby Parker.\\n\\nThere are so many glasses in the world, why do we want to add more? We can\\'t forget that glasses are a resource of the earth, we don\\'t want to just waste it. And you can see some imperfections in my glasses, people love that because the frames are alive, they are real. If I go to a party and someone has the same pair of frames, they are still going to be a little bit different.\\n\\nWhy did you immigrate to New York City in the first place, was it the draw of capitalism?\\n\\nNo, because when I moved here, I already saw the first steps of capitalism in Russia. And it wasn\\'t a pleasant story, a lot of crime and corruption. When I was kid growing up, education was free, medication was free. I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m a communist or socialist, but I have good memories of that time.\\n\\nI really wanted to live in New York because it\\'s the capital of the world and I believed that I would be able to fulfill myself at least partially in America. All the people with crazy minds [laughs] come here, I wanted to experience that! I loved the Doors, Jim Morrison, when I was a kid, also The Velvet Underground, Bob Dylan, Miles Davis.\\n\\nI fell in love with New York right away. It\\'s a beautiful city, you see industrial parts, modern buildings. The only shocking part -- why would you put garbage on the street?\\n\\nYou didn\\'t really know anyone here, so that must have been a little scary.\\n\\nNo, I mean, there were some unknown parts, but I survived the collapse of the Soviet Union. I thought, if I survived that, I\\'d probably be able to survive New York City.\\n\\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed for clarity.', 'source': {'uri': 'observer.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Observer'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'nina_roberts@observer.com', 'name': 'Nina Roberts', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/dsc_5091.jpeg?quality=80&crop=0px%2C119px%2C4496px%2C2248px&resize=876%2C438&strip', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 0}\n",

Sept. 20 is designated California Surfing Day and the state markets surf vacations.\\n\\nNewsom said the state\\'s tourism arm, Visit California, has already expressed interest in working with El Salvador.\\n\\nThough El Salvador has among the highest homicide rates in the world and the U.S. government warns its citizens about traveling there, Newsom and Bukele said tourist areas are much safer than other parts of the country. Bukele said he\\'ll work to get the U.S. travel advisory removed when he takes office.\\n\\nWorking together on promoting surfing and economic tourism may be one of the most tangible ways Newsom can build a partnership with El Salvador. As his trip concluded, Newsom told reporters he\\'s walking away more educated about the country\\'s challenges. The updated budget he\\'ll present in May will include new resources for immigrants arriving in the United States and he plans to encourage California business interests to invest in El Salvador; he also discussed bringing Salvadoran business leaders to California for a visit.\\n\\nAs a governor, Newsom has little power to effect immigration policy, but he said his trip was vital to understanding the gang violence and other dynamics that cause people to flee.\\n\\nBukele, who takes office in June, wants to strengthen U.S.-Salvadoran relations and was diplomatic when asked his views on President Donald Trump.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t want to meddle into U.S. politics,\" he said. \"We will work with any administration.\"\\n\\nThe U.S. government already invests some money in Salvadoran infrastructure, including roads and water and sewage treatment near El Salvador\\'s coasts through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, created in 2004 under then-President George W. Bush. Last year it contributed about $3 million for a $10.8 million project to develop the coastal area called El Zonte to build hotels and a water treatment plant. MCC has pledged $277 million for coastal development and other projects over a number of years.\\n\\nSeveral surfing business owners who joined Newsom on Tuesday said without improved roads and sewage treatment it is harder to attract more tourists. El Salvador has world class surf, particularly on the Punta Roca beach that is well-known to traveling surfers, but lags behind nearby Costa Rica as an international tourist destination, said Jess Ponting, director of the Center for Surf Research at San Diego State University.\\n\\n\"The surf tourism resources (waves) are definitely there, surf tourists just need to know it\\'s relatively safe to travel to and be in those locations,\" he said in an email. \"It seems pretty clear that there is a lot of untapped potential for surf tourism in El Salvador.\"\\n\\nBeyond the economic benefits, surfing can provide a dream for young children with few opportunities, said Marcelo Castellanos, who runs a surfing academy in the area. He told Newsom about an 11-year-old boy he trained who eight years later became a professional surfer traveling the world.\\n\\n\"All the kids that grow up in these poor areas know they all can dream,\" he said. \"That happened because we have this program, and we invite the kids who can\\'t pay.
